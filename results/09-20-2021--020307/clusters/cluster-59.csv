"Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of Elderly Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia The objective of the proposed direct Phase-II SBIR project is to develop and study and the effectiveness of Serious Games and physical Activities played/performed by elderly people with Alzheimer’s disease and AD- related Dementias in interaction with Ryan, our successfully piloted Socially Assistive Robot (SAR). Ryan is an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with AD/ADRD. Ryan uses state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology for automated facial expression recognition, natural language processing, and tracking of human body that are used in personalization and adaptation of the games and physical activities. According to the Alzheimer’s Association an estimated 5.7 million Americans have AD and is projected to rise to 13.8 million, as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. While SAR research prototypes exist that can interact with users playing physical cognitive games equipped with artificial intelligence technology and personalization, to our knowledge, no such cooperative SAR (prototype or commercial) for electronic gameplay with individuals suffering from dementia exists today. Our game designs will target “Cognition”, “Memory”, “Spatial Relation”, “Social Relationship”, and “Motor Skills” abilities of players. We will conduct a pilot study to measure Ryan’s effectiveness in mental and socio- emotional stimulation of users with mild dementia. This innovative technology stands to produce significant financial savings and improve the quality of life of individuals living with AD/ADRD, their families, and caregivers. The goal of the project is to develop serious games and physical activities co-played by a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of Elderly Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia,9910078,R44AG066439,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Control Groups', 'Cost of Illness', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hobbies', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motor Skills', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Well-Being', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'active control', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'common symptom', 'community living', 'cost', 'design', 'exergame', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prototype', 'repetitive behavior', 'skeletal movement', 'skills', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'success', 'tool']",NIA,"DREAM FACE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2019,463523,0.16576723216111747
"A machine learning approach to increasing diagnostic accuracy in Atypical Alzheimer's disease cases with clinical-radiological mismatch Project Summary Machine-learning (ML) approaches have been applied for automatic diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). These studies use highly variable training and testing datasets and consequently confound objective comparison of classification between methodologies because of differences between datasets, feature extraction, feature selection, and validation methods. The hypothesis of this proposed project is that advanced ML co-analysis of commonly used MRI imaging and neuropsychological information may hold potential for improved hard-to-detect AD diagnosis. This study proposes a fully automated two-step AD diagnosis framework for patients with dementia through the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1: To discover volumetric MRI imaging biomarkers for dementia by studying feature-based  multiresolution-fractal texture extraction, Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) multiclass feature selection,  and fusion with feature-less deep ML methods. In this Aim, we will design hand-crafted MRI features and  featureless deep learning methods to obtain imaging features. Multi-class KLD will be developed to select  and fuse different features to generate MRI biomarkers.  Aim 2: To combine advanced regression based feature fusion and prediction for MRI biomarkers and  neuropsychological information informant history, AD risk factors, and functional status for accurate and  hard-to-detect AD classification. This Aim systematically fuses the newly discovered MRI imaging  biomarkers with a battery of non-imaging features to target the atypical AD cases where volumetry and  neuropsychological testing alone may not yield AD detection. This will help to reduce the number of patients that will need referral for further more expensive PET imaging for diagnosis of AD. Project Narrative There is need to understand the effect of combining feature-guided deep Magnetic Resonance Imaging with other data, such as neurophysiological data, informant history, Alzheimer's dementia risk factors, and functional status, for accurate diagnosis of atypical Alzheimer's Dementia cases. Early intervention has the potential to improve the quality of life of such patients. Diagnosis at the early stage may also improve patient access to support services and enable effective planning for future treatment.",A machine learning approach to increasing diagnostic accuracy in Atypical Alzheimer's disease cases with clinical-radiological mismatch,9881702,R01EB020683,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Family Physicians', 'Fractals', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Validation', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'functional status', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'informant', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mixed dementia', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'primary care setting', 'quantitative imaging', 'recruit', 'symptomatology', 'tau Proteins']",NIBIB,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,233588,0.14991470799470696
"Quantifying Brain Abnormality by Multimodality Neuroimage Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes, afforded by multimodality neuroimaging data, for both diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's diseases (AD).

"The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents Abstract: Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the US and epidemiological data suggests they are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and have a higher occurrence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). AD is defined neuropathologically by the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques. In addition to these hallmarks, many AD patients have mixed neuropathologies, including Lewy bodies (LBs) and pathological indices of CVD. Studies, involving mainly NHWs, have shown associations of these neuropathologies with clinical, genetic, and demographic variables providing insights into disease mechanisms and prevention strategies. However, there is a relative dearth of neuropathology studies on Hispanics. It is imperative to have neuropathology studies with individuals having diverse characteristics as this maximizes variability allowing for better identification of disease risk factors for more precision in development of preventative measures. This study will examine the neuropathologic landscape (the presence, location, and density of NFTs, plaques, CVD and LBs) of Hispanics compared to NHWs and determine if this landscape is altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables. To achieve efficiencies in time and further measurement precision we will enhance and adapt innovative machine learning algorithms to narrow in on pathology location and provide more quantitative analyses. Based on previous findings our central hypothesis is that Hispanics will have different neuropathologic landscapes when compared to NHWs and these differences are influenced by underlying risk factors, especially cardiovascular risk factors. Our specific aims are to: 1) profile the presence, location, and semi-quantitative densities of NFTs, plaques, LBs, and pathological indices of CVD in the setting of AD in Hispanics compared to NHWs, 2) profile and determine if pathologic measures from Aim 1 are altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables (APOE status, Hispanic origin, age at death, clinical history of cerebrovascular events (i.e. stroke), hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, sex, and/or education) and 3) strengthen and adapt a deep learning pipeline for quantifying AD pathologies. We will capitalize on existing well-characterized resources within three Alzheimer’s disease centers at University of California- Davis, the University of California- San Diego, and Columbia that contain a diverse autopsy confirmed AD Hispanic and NHW cohort. Also, we will use machine learning resources at the University of California San Francisco. This proposal will be the first largescale initiative to delineate the neuropathology in over 100 Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican origins compare to over 200 NHWs and determine the impact of comorbid risk factors. Profiling neuropathologic landscapes and understanding underlying factors has potential to shed light on mechanistic differences in disease development leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. Results will directly advance understanding of brain health (pathology) in an important and growing part of the elderly population that to date there is miniscule neuropathology information.

"Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an urgent national and international research priority. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark of AD. Their building blocks are Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, respectively. At present, we lack an understanding of the set of genes that affect formation of plaques and tangles along with protective and pathological responses to these toxic peptides. Biologists are now gathering gene expression data and Aβ and tau measures from human brain tissues. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (here, gene expression levels) that best predict an outcome (Aβ or tau level). The identified features, biomarkers, can help determine the molecular basis for plaques and tangles. Unfortunately, false positive biomarkers are very common, as evidenced by low success rates of replication in independent data and low success reaching clinical practice (less than 1%). We seek to radically shift the current paradigm in biomarker discovery by resolving three fundamental problems with the current approach using novel, theoretically well-founded machine learning (ML) methods to learn interpretable models from data. Aim 1. Learn an interpretable feature representation from publicly available, high-throughput brain data. High-dimensionality, hidden variables, and complex feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., observed statistical associations) and true biological interactions. To increase the chance to identify true positive biomarkers, we need new feature selection criteria to learn a model that better explains rather than simply predicts the outcome. To do so, our proposed ML algorithms will identify the genes that are likely to give a meaningful explanation of the outcome (Aβ or tau level) by inferring both the functions of genes in the cellular processes contributing to AD and the gene interaction network from many existing brain datasets. Aim 2. Make interpretable predictions using a unified framework to explain model predictions. Due to disease heterogeneity, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) often more accurately describe relationships between genes and an outcome than simpler, linear models, but lack interpretability. We will develop a novel ML framework that interprets complex model predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a specific prediction, which will identify features of high importance for each individual as personalized markers and classify subjects based on these importance estimates. Aim 3. Validate the identified candidate biomarkers using powerful worm models of AD. Analyzing observational data without doing interventional experiments cannot prove causal relationships. In collaboration with co-I Matt Kaeberlein, we will utilize powerful nematode models of AD to test our hypotheses on the role of certain genes as disease modifiers, and develop a new way to refine the models based on this knowledge. Successful completion of this project will result in previously unknown molecular basis for Aβ and tau levels, potential therapeutic targets, and general ML techniques widely applicable to many other data science problems. Project Narrative In the United States alone, someone receives an Alzheimer’s diagnosis every 66 seconds, and the disease has become the 6th leading cause of death in this country; Alzheimer’s disease (AD) currently has no cure, no prevention, and no treatment to reverse or halt its deadly progression. The recent, rapid growth of gene expression data from human brain tissues hold great promise for identifying therapeutic targets, but extremely low success rates to identify true positive biomarkers indicate fundamental problems with the current computational approach being used. We seek to revolutionize the way we identify drug targets by developing novel machine learning techniques that extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data, combined with biological validation in an animal model of AD.",Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets,9639494,R01AG061132,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'Network-based', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Oral', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'RNA Interference', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Selection Criteria', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain tissue', 'candidate marker', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'direct application', 'disease heterogeneity', 'drug response prediction', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'proteostasis', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,582016,0.11829068884411224
"A Specialized Automatic Speech Recognition and Conversational Platform to Enable Socially Assistive Robots for Persons with Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Abstract 1 in 3 seniors in the United States dies with dementia, of which Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form. AD patients suffer from decreased ability to meaningfully communicate and interact, which causes significant stress and burden for both professional caregivers and family members. Socially assistive robots (SARs) have been designed to promote therapeutic interaction and communication. Unfortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) has long been challenged by the speech of elderly persons, who exhibit age-related voice tremors, hesitations, imprecise production of consonants, increased variability of fundamental frequency, and other barriers that can be exacerbated by the neurological changes associated with AD, further complicated by common environmental noises such as the ceiling fan, television, etc. Because of the resulting poor real-world speech and language understanding by available SAR technologies, scarce human caregivers are often required to guide AD patients through SAR interactions, limiting SARs to small deployments, mostly as part of research studies. Unlike existing approaches relying purely on AI, care.coach™ is developing a SAR-like avatar that converses with elderly and AD patients through truly natural speech. Each avatar is controlled by a 24x7 team of trained human staff who can cost-effectively monitor and engage 12 or more patients sequentially (2 simultaneously) through the audio/visual feeds from the patient’s avatar device. The staff communicate with each patient by sending text commands which are converted into the avatar’s voice through a speech synthesis engine. The staff contribute to the system their human abilities for speech and natural language processing (NLP) and for generating free-form conversational responses to help patients build personal relationships with the avatar. The staff are guided by a software-driven expert system embedded into their work interface, which is programmed with evidence-based prompting and protocols to support healthy behaviors and self-care. This SBIR Fast-Track project will leverage the unique data generated by our human- in-the-loop platform to develop new ASR capabilities, enabling fully automatic conversational protocols to engage and support AD patients without human intervention. We aim in Phase I to leverage our unique prior work dataset to train an automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine to enable the understanding of certain types of elderly and AD patient speech more successfully than any currently available engine. We aim in Phase II to incorporate this new engine along with an NLP module into our existing human-in-the-loop avatar system, recruiting a population of AD patients to further train and validate with during a 2-year human subjects study so that we can demonstrate full automation of a significant portion of our avatar conversations with mild- to-moderate level AD patients. Thus, we will improve the commercial scalability of our avatars, while validating our new ASR/NLP engine as the most accurate platform for enabling the next generation of AD-focused SARs. Narrative Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been challenged by the speech of elderly persons, and especially persons with dementia, due to age-related voice tremors, hesitations, imprecise production of consonants, increased variability of fundamental frequency, and other barriers. Unlike existing approaches to socially assistive robots (SARs) relying purely on limited AI for conversation, care.coach™ has been commercializing a SAR-like avatar that converses with elderly and AD patients through truly natural speech, powered by a 24x7 team of trained human staff. The unique data sets that our solution enables us to gather at commercial scale will be leveraged in this SBIR project to develop an automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) engine that is best-in-class for AD applications, improving the commercial scalability of our avatars by reducing our dependence on human staff, while serving as a new AI platform for enabling the next generation of AD- focused, conversational SARs.",A Specialized Automatic Speech Recognition and Conversational Platform to Enable Socially Assistive Robots for Persons with Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia,9777444,R44AG062014,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Exhibits', 'Expert Systems', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feeds', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Jamaica', 'Label', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Loneliness', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Price', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Self Care', 'Semantics', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Washington', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'age related', 'aging population', 'automated speech recognition', 'care providers', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'feeding', 'health plan', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'next generation', 'older patient', 'patient engagement', 'patient response', 'phrases', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'restraint', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'social assistive robot', 'speech recognition', 'speech synthesis', 'success', 'usability']",NIA,CARE.COACH CORPORATION,R44,2019,349998,0.018075766363355554
"Development and validation of novel tests in the DCT drawing analysis platform for the detection of Alzheimer’s Disease-related early cognitive impairment Project Summary/Abstract Early detection of AD and AD-related dementias is critical for the development of novel therapeutic agents and for effective patient treatment and care. DCT has created a platform able to detect subtle changes in behavior indicative of early cognitive impairment by using a digital pen to record drawing motions and automatically analyzing that data using a combination of artificial intelligence and neuropsychological analysis. DCT has successfully launched its first test on the platform, DCTclockTM, which has been demonstrated to detect subtle cognitive change in early Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and AD-related dementias earlier than standard cognitive tests, correlate with known AD biomarkers such as amyloid and tau in preclinical-AD subjects, and detect known APOE genetic risk in cognitively healthy participants. The test is FDA-cleared to market for general cognitive assessment and is currently used in multinational clinical trials, research initiatives, and by practicing clinicians for patient care. DCT is now conducting a study involving 400 participants ranging from cognitively healthy to demented to validate a tablet as input device for the drawing data, and to collect data on a set of novel tablet-based drawing tasks including: a symbol task, a visual retention task, a trail making task, a path- finding task, and a visuoconstructional task. We aim to analyze task data collected in the study to produce a set of easily-deployable, rapid, cost-effective, and sensitive tests to be used as cognitive digital biomarkers in clinical trials for AD and AD-related dementias. The first aim is to develop novel cognitive measures from these additional tests and obtain preliminary validation. Existing data will be split into training and testing sets. The training set will be analyzed to develop metrics, following an interpretable hierarchical analysis structure with low-level drawing measurements combined in a set of composite scales tied to a cognitive concept (i.e., information processing), and then further combined to obtain a simple 0-100 score for performance on the test. The testing set will be used to conduct preliminary validation consisting of a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, correlation measures to existing neuropsychological tests, and test-retest reliability measurements to ensure repeat testing stability. The second aim is to implement the developed metrics in the commercial DCT platform. Robust software will be created for the measurement, storage, and display of the novel metrics, setting a foundation to enable usage of the metrics by research and commercial partners.

"Integrative Motor Activity Biomarker for the Risk of Alzheimer's Risk Project Summary/Abstract Developing effective interventions for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires early detection of the disease. With recent advances in wearable device and physiological data analytical tools, it is feasible to assess many physiological functions unobtrusively by monitoring spontaneous motor activity. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated, non-invasive biomarker for the risk of Alzheimer's dementia using motor activity recordings. Among many physiological functions derived from motor activity, reduced physical activity levels, sleep disturbances, circadian dysfunction, and perturbation in fractal physiological regulation appear to precede the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and signify an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia. However, it is unknown whether these dysfunctions predict Alzheimer's risk independently or they are interconnected to amplify/diminish each other's adverse effect. For a better prediction of Alzheimer's dementia using motor activity, PI and his team propose to leverage the above physiological risk factors using a novel artificial intelligence technique. To achieve this, PI and his team will utilize the existing longitudinal database of the Memory and Aging Project at Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, in which over 1,400 old participants have been enrolled since 2005 and have agreed to (i) undergo annual motor activity monitor and structured clinical examinations and (ii) donate brain, the entire spinal cord, and selected nerve and muscles at the time of death. The ambulatory motor activity recordings collected annually will be used to assess a series of constructs including (i) physical activity (level of physical activity, intensity of physical activity, and average daily inactivity duration), (ii) sleep characteristics (total sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and sleep fragmentation), (iii) circadian rhythmicitiy (normalized 24-h amplitude, acrophase of daily activity rhythm, interdaily stability, and intradaily variability), and (iv) fractal motor regulation (temporal correlations in motor activity fluctuations at small and large time scales). Using these physiological measures together with clinical diagnosis, cognition, genetics, and post-mortem histopathology, three aims will be addressed: 1) determine whether a deep learning based neural network model can construct an integrated biomarker from the above physiological measures for better prediction of the risk of Alzheimer's dementia and the risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia in a short time frame (i.e., 2 years); 2) determine whether the integrated biomarker modifies or interacts with the genetic effect on AD; and 3) determine how specifically the integrated biomarker reflects AD pathology at autopsy. Achieving the aims will result in the first integrated biomarker of motor activity that leverages multimodal, noninvasive measurements for a better prediction of Alzheimer's dementia. The results to be obtained may also lead to a better understanding of the complex biology and physiology of AD, which will potentially guide the seeking of disease modifying therapies or interventions. NARRATIVE Many non-cognitive physiological changes including reduced physical activity, sleep and circadian disturbances, and degraded fractal regulation predict the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and they can be assessed unobtrusively from daily spontaneous motor activity. Adopting a novel artificial intelligence approach, this project is proposed to develop an integrated biomarker for AD risk in older adults by combining these physiological functions, and to examine the relationships of this biomarker with genetics and AD pathology. This project will potentially provide a non-invasive tool for predicting AD risk and lead unique insights into the complex pathology of AD, which is important for developing new therapeutic strategies to treat AD or slow down AD progression.",Integrative Motor Activity Biomarker for the Risk of Alzheimer's Risk,9804299,RF1AG064312,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Categories', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Histopathology', 'Immunochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Sex Differences', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Fragmentations', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Spinal Cord', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'aged', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'circadian', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'dementia risk', 'effective intervention', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'insight', 'longitudinal database', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuropathology', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'sex', 'tau aggregation', 'wearable device']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,RF1,2019,3584687,0.09614018669270626
"Rapid Profiling of the Plasma Proteome and Machine Learning Analytics for Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT The main objective of this project is to develop an innovative blood-based test for highly sensitive and specific, non-invasive and cost-efficient diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which would leverage Seer's proprietary Proteograph platform enabled by the convergence of nanotechnology, protein corona, proteomics, and data science. Beyond neuropsychological testing, two approaches have thus far been clinically validated for AD detection, including neuroimaging and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-β or Aβ). In contrast to the neuroimaging (which is expensive and time-consuming) and CSF analysis (which is less expensive, but involves an invasive lumbar puncture procedure), a blood-based test for AD diagnosis has the potential to be dramatically less costly and easier to implement. Nevertheless, the search for reliable blood- based biomarkers has been challenging and the blood-based detection using ELISA or other epitope-based methods that go after a few biomarkers (e.g., Aβ42 or Tau) have not been successful, presumably owing to the vast dynamic range and high complexity of the plasma components. We have recently demonstrated that our multi-nanoparticle (NP) protein corona technology can facilitate broad and deep profiling of plasma proteome, and by combining with machine learning approaches, could lead to the development of Proteograph classifiers for highly accurate detection of different diseases including AD. As compared to current mass spectrometry- based proteomic techniques that require complex and time-consuming depletion or fractionation workflows for detection of low abundance/rare proteins, our multi-NP protein corona strategy is fast and high-throughput for analysis of the vast body of information in the proteome. In this Direct Phase II project, we will build upon the proof-of-concept studies to further test how Seer's Proteograph platform can be applied to develop a robust blood-based test to detect AD. Specifically, we will identify a panel (~6-10) of NPs from Seer's NP library for broad and deep coverage of the plasma proteome of AD patients (Aim 1); develop Proteograph classifiers and identify the proteins critical for classification through machine learning of the proteomic data generated from the panel of NPs with a cohort of 150 plasma samples of AD and healthy controls (Aim 2); and validate the accuracy of the detection test (based on the important proteins identified in Aim 2) in a separate blind cohort of 450 Aβ-positive AD patients and healthy controls (Aim 3). We expect that the successful completion of this SBIR project will lead to the clinical use of a blood-based AD test, which could further benefit earlier treatment, therapeutic outcomes, and health costs and quality of life for the elderly. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 6th-leading cause of death in the United States, and it is projected that nearly 14 million Americans will be living with AD by 2050, according to the Alzheimer's Association, translating to a healthcare cost of ~$1.1 trillion. Accurate and early identification of AD, ideally at the earliest symptomatic or even pre-symptomatic stage, could facilitate better monitoring of therapy response and better planning for the care of family members with the disease, thus offering a tremendous economic impact. In this Direct Phase II SBIR project, we will develop a highly sensitive and specific, non-invasive, and cost-effective blood-based test for routine diagnosis of AD, which represents one of the greatest medical challenges of this era.",Rapid Profiling of the Plasma Proteome and Machine Learning Analytics for Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,9846720,R44AG065051,"['Address', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Fractionation', 'Gender', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuscripts', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Puncture procedure', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'economic impact', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'nanoparticle', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-patent', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'therapy outcome']",NIA,"SEER, INC.",R44,2019,1130758,0.23215199913978546
"A Knowledge Map to Find Alzheimer's Disease Drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens. Feasibility rests with prior studies on evolution, networks, systems, and text-mining that demonstrate accurate predictions of deleterious mutations and their clinical sequelae and the discovery of drivers of diseases. Broadly, this work will yield proof of principle for a novel quantitative model that integrates fundamental concepts from mathematics and molecular evolution, and for a low resolution but large-scale map of biomedical knowledge in which network notions of distance computed by machine learning identify relevant functional hypothesis that would otherwise be easily overlooked. The result will be a new experimental ability to unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship in Alzheimer's Disease so as to guide drug therapy. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease projected to rise dramatically in our aging population. To develop drugs against it, we propose to train machine learning on the DNA of patients with Alzheimer's to detect genes with abnormal mathematical features in their mutations. We will place these genes in a “map”, which represents a large fraction of biomedical knowledge in a high-dimensional network, the drugs that fall near our genes of interest in this map are our candidates, and experiments will test in cell and mouse models whether they affect the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's.",A Knowledge Map to Find Alzheimer's Disease Drugs,9928609,R01AG061105,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Calculi', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evolution', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'database structure', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'stem', 'text searching']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,228000,0.0927567374263761
"Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting tens of millions of people. A top research priority in AD is to find a biomarker sensitive to early disease and disease progression because that will likely provide the best opportunities for searching and evaluating effective treatments for this currently incurable brain disease. Human brain relies on cerebral blood flow (CBF) for its energy supply and waste removal. Previous research has indicated that CBF reductions cause neuron inactivity and neurotoxic waste accumulation and subsequently neuron death, which may eventually lead to AD dementia. Measuring CBF and following its longitudinal course may then provide a highly potential biomarker for early AD and its progression. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI is a technique for quantifying CBF without using exogenous tracers. Because it is relatively cheaper and can be repeated many times, it is well suited for longitudinal AD research. Sensitivity of ASL MRI to AD and prodromal AD has been shown in many cross-sectional studies (comparing AD to controls) by other groups and us. But several important questions still remain unanswered including the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD and AD progression, the longitudinal CBF change patterns, and sex difference of CBF in AD. Addressing those questions needs large size longitudinal data and expertise for analyzing ASL MRI data due to the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The purpose of this project is to address those open questions by leveraging our extensive expertise on ASL MRI and the accumulating longitudinal ASL data from ADNI (a large ongoing multi-site AD neuroimaging study). The novel information or outcome from this project will include the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD, CBF change rate when disease progresses or reverts, gender effects in AD and its progression, and a next-generation ASL MRI processing algorithm based on deep-machine learning (DL), and a DL-based AD prediction model. We will first confirm our previous ADNI ASL CBF findings using larger sample and updated methods (not available before). We will then check sensitivity of ASL CBF for tracking and predicting disease progression or cognitive declines. Gender effects on CBF in AD will be explicitly examined, which may reveal a clue for the higher prevalence of AD in females. We will revisit those studies using the DL-based ASL denoising algorithm. Pursuing those aims will help establishing ASL CBF as an AD biomarker and provide a versatile AD prediction model using ASL CBF as well as other valuable biomarkers provided in ADNI. Developing and sharing the DL ASL MRI denoising method will benefit not only AD research but also the various scientific projects based on ASL MRI. The feasibility of this innovative but clinically important project is ensured by our decades of experience and the substantial pilot investigations in each aspect of the study, including ASL MRI, AD ASL study, and machine learning. Identifying biomarkers sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its progression is central to AD studies. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) will be measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI and assessed for early AD detection and progression monitoring. We will also develop a next-generation ASL denoising technique to further improve ASL CBF SNR and reliability. Given our aging population and the increasing prevalence of AD, performing this project is likely to have significant public health impact.

"Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a growing epidemic, and potential treatments are unlikely to be effective unless deployed during the earliest stages of AD, prior to cognitive symptoms. Currently there are no inexpensive, non-invasive biomarkers for effective AD screening necessary for early recognition and treatment on a broad scale. Sleep is abnormal in preclinical AD, even prior to cognitive symptoms, and disrupted sleep may in turn accelerate AD pathological mechanisms. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures brain function, and the stereotyped nature of sleep EEG offers a particularly rich opportunity to identify biomarkers of brain dysfunction due to AD. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that sleep-wake brain mechanisms are abnormal very early in AD, and can be detected via subtle but distinct sleep and EEG changes. The objective is to develop sleep and EEG biomarkers of AD, to enable non-invasive and inexpensive screening on a large scale, through the following specific aims.  Aim 1) Identify sleep-wake patterns across the 24-hour day characteristic of AD pathology. Ambulatory sleep-EEG data will be recorded over the 24-hour period in the home setting from a large, diverse, community-based cohort, with the hypothesis that increased sleep-wake transitions over the 24-hour day are characteristic of preclinical-to-mild AD. Aim 2) Assess slow wave integrity measures as biomarkers of AD pathology. EEG abnormalities of slow wave sleep are particularly associated with elevated amyloid-β levels and plaques. Novel analytic techniques will extract bihemispheric slow wave coherence, slow wave velocity, and slow wave intradaily ratio from EEG data collected during sleep and wake. The hypothesis is that amyloid plaques present in early AD will reduce slow wave integrity by all three measures. Aim 3) Determine the EEG signature of AD using machine learning. Machine learning techniques will be applied to EEG from a full attended overnight polysomnogram, to identify a “signature” of AD pathology. The goal is to identify a “signature” that can be detected with spatially limited EEG data that could be collected at home.  The expected outcome of these aims is to identify sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD that can be detected noninvasively and inexpensively at home. The impact of our work will be the ability to screen large populations easily for AD pathology, so that affected individuals can be identified and treated. Moreover, sleep-EEG biomarkers could be used to track disease progression and treatment response in clinical trials for AD. Lastly, since sleep disturbance has a direct effect on AD pathology, by identifying sleep-EEG changes very early in the pathological process, we may be able to intervene, improve sleep, and potentially change the trajectory of AD.  ! Project Narrative Combating the looming crisis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will require identifying and treating individuals with AD even before cognitive symptoms appear. The proposed project will develop sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD in a large, diverse, community-based cohort, which can be used for inexpensive, non-invasive screening for AD on a broad scale. This project will enable large-scale screening and treatment of early AD, use of sleep-EEG theranostic biomarkers for clinical and drug-development purposes, and intervention for sleep disturbances to potentially change the trajectory of AD.",Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,9785356,R01AG059507,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Drug Development', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Napping', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Race', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'combat', 'cost', 'early detection biomarkers', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep onset', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'tau Proteins', 'theranostics', 'treatment response']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,383354,-0.023612987352256875
"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care.

"Dementia Screening Using Automated Speech Analysis: A Pilot Study Project Summary Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is vital if treatments are to be most effective, yet for myriad reasons, a staggering number of older Americans do not receive diagnostic services. Recent technological breakthroughs show considerable promise to identify biomarkers for AD, but nonetheless still require costly and often invasive in-person testing. What is needed is a new approach that can rival current technologies in terms of diagnostic accuracy, while also permitting wider accessibility and economy. The ubiquitous telephone will be the vehicle for this approach in the proposed study. Telephone-based diagnostic screening tests have emerged as a viable alternative to in-person testing, and appear well tolerated and cost-effective. These tests are effective at detecting frank dementia, yet lack sensitivity to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) a likely risk factor for AD. Deficits in language function, particularly semantic knowledge, are characteristic of AD, and these changes may occur decades prior to the emergence of overt symptoms. Research from our group has demonstrated that automated speech analysis can quantify aspects of semantic knowledge in psychiatric samples and can provide similar information to human raters in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Hence, our goal is to determine the acceptability, sensitivity and specificity of an automated speech analysis approach to the detection of AD and MCI from speech samples elicited via telephone. Such an approach has the potential to greatly outperform current screening methods, not only in terms of sensitivity to cognitive decline, but also accessibility, cost, and user satisfaction. If successful, this project could form an integral part of an adaptive, machine learning decision support system to accurately predict an individual's dementia conversion threshold and trajectory of decline. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease is a significant and mounting public health concern, yet for a host of reasons, a staggering number of older Americans do not receive a diagnostic evaluation. The proposed study seeks to address this issue by leveraging a device ubiquitous in many homes: the telephone.

"Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. While research efforts continue to focus on the causes of AD and to develop effective medical treatments, there is also a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. There may be subtle changes in brain and cognitive function that are detectable before major symptoms emerge. One approach for characterizing these vulnerabilities is the use of functional and structural neuroimaging to identify risk profiles for AD. The present study proposes and tests a model of AD pathology using neuroimaging network analysis and machine learning approaches to provide insight on widespread changes in information processing in the AD brain. The proposed model hypothesizes that some aspects of network information processing reflect neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD pathology (e.g., hub connectivity and global connectivity) whereas other network properties reflect attempts to compensate for compromised information processing (e.g., diffusion of information). In addition, this proposal compares the efficacy of models with respect to discriminating diagnostic categories (e.g., machine learning classification of AD and clinically normal subjects) versus isolating underlying dimensions of AD cognitive decline (e.g., machine learning prediction of memory and language scores from network features). Finally, this study will determine whether features of AD pathology are present in an at-risk sample of subjects; namely, individuals diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This will be examined by transferring the AD network models to aMCI subjects and testing whether the model can discriminate aMCI from clinically normal matched controls and whether the model can predict scores on cognitive tests. The analytic approach will using resting state fMRI data as a primary assay of network integrity, but diffusion imaging and task fMRI data will also be examined in an exploratory aim. The general approach will recruit individuals with AD, aMCI and clinically normal matched controls for each diagnostic group. The groups that are compared directly will be matched for amyloid status, as indicated by florbetapir PET imaging. The novel contributions of this project include (a) testing a network model of AD pathology that unifies various measures of network functioning, (b) comparing efficacy of modeling with respect to delineating diagnostic categories versus capturing underlying cognitive dimensions of AD, and (c) transferring the AD model to an at-risk group to assess disease vulnerability. This latter innovation can be applied in future studies to any group of subjects that is defined at risk, such as those with genetic vulnerability or positive family history. The present study also sets the stage for a subsequent longitudinal follow-up study to validate whether individuals identified at risk using network modeling actually convert to AD. Ultimately, network modeling of this sort may be used as a relatively less expensive and less invasive biomarker than PET imaging, which could lead to earlier treatments and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years, there is a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. The present study will use neuroimaging to examine brain connectivity and determine whether some aspects of altered connectivity are present in individuals who are at risk for AD: individuals who have mild cognitive impairment. This approach could be used in the future to possibly detect risk for AD before any cognitive symptoms emerge, thereby enabling earlier treatment and intervention to combat the devastating cognitive, social and financial consequences of AD.",Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease,9731362,R01AG055132,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Financial compensation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Center for Health Statistics', 'Well in self', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'combat', 'comparative efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'response', 'social']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,745812,0.2600295958559278
"Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people worldwide. Due to the fact that the longitudinal abnormality associated with AD can be detected in vivo, neuroimaging measures have been playing an increasingly important role in searching for biomarkers of AD that can be used for early diagnosis, progression monitoring, and therapy responses measurement. The goal of this project is to create a set of cutting-edge computational tools for identifying very early biomarkers of AD and alert AD progression via longitudinal image analysis. The key to achieve high sensitivity and specificity AD diagnosis of individuals is the stable longitudinal measurements. In light of this, the candidate will first develop a novel learning-based 4D (3D+t) landmark detector (Aim 1) to find the landmark locations at all time points simultaneously. The trajectories of landmark set form a compact 4D shape representation to achieve temporal consistency in registering longitudinal image sequence to the template (Aim 2). As a result, the consistency of low level features extracted from MR or PET images can be significantly improved. Since the subject-specific patterns of structural/functional changes, although more relevant to AD diagnosis of individuals, is very subtle compared to huge variation across subjects, the candidate will further develop a supervised deep neural network to learn the latent high-level spatial-temporal patterns by coupled stacked auto-encoder and temporal max pooling (Aim 2). The learned spatial-temporal morphological patterns consist of (1) cross- sectional features from MR and PET images, and (2) dynamic short/long term longitudinal patterns w.r.t. different number of historical time points. In a clinical setting, not all patients have a large and complete set of neuroimaging data, or an equal number of imaging scans. In order to eventually translate to clinic arena, a novel AD detector that uses a spatial-temporal hyper-graph learning framework (Aim 3) is proposed to not only provide high sensitivity and specificity in AD diagnosis but also solve the above difficulties. To evaluate the diagnostic value, we will apply our trained AD detector to ADNI dataset and patient data collected in UNC (Aim 3). Finally, we will package all our developed methods into a software package and release it freely to the neuroimaging community, to facilitate other AD-biomarker-exploration projects performed in other institutes. Project Narrative This proposal aims for the development of novel neuroimaging analysis methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal image data. In particular, a set of automated algorithms will be created to aid the difficult task of analyzing subtle and complex morphological change patterns of Alzheimer's disease during the disease progression. The successful completion of this project will represent an import milestone in neuroimaging research by bringing forth the fruition of a powerful and practical system for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at individual level, for potential effective treatment.",Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,9706076,K01AG049089,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Attention', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evolution', 'Fruit', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'disease diagnosis', 'early detection biomarkers', 'economic cost', 'effective therapy', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'functional loss', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'social', 'specific biomarkers', 'task analysis', 'tool']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2019,117098,0.2173188403503302
"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias that are associated with major adverse effects on daily function and quality of life, and accelerate time to institutionalization. Of all the NPS, depression is the most frequently observed symptom in people with mild cognitive impairment and early AD. As the disease progresses, agitation, delusions and hallucinations become more common, whereas apathy is the most persistent and frequent NPS throughout all the stages of AD. AD-NPS share some clinical features with serious mental illnesses (SMIs), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but whether these conditions share similar aethiopathies is unclear. Given that reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias do not exist, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses is a critical next step to identify reliable biomarkers that could lead to novel therapeutics.  There are two overarching goals of this proposal. First, we will identify the molecular mechanisms and neuropathological changes that are associated with the presence of NPS in patients with AD. Second, we will examine if the mechanisms of pathology associated with NPS are shared or distinct among AD and SMIs. More specifically, we propose to build multi-scale integrative models using phenomics and genomics data from 1,264 autopsy cases derived from a single brain bank. The bank includes detailed phenomics data such as well characterized NPS, clinical diagnosis (AD and other neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric traits), severity of cognitive decline and neuropathology for each patient sample. From each case, we will apply innovative approaches that reduce the cost and technical biases associated with conventional methods, and capture gene expression signatures and epigenetic regulatory elements at the single-cell level. Novel deep-learning methods will be applied for the multi-scale integration of neuropathologic changes with genetic markers and functional genomic changes (such as changes in gene expression and enhancer sequences) within specific cell types, to predict various NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric traits; we refer to these integrative models as genotype- marker-phenotype models. We expect that these models will enable us to assign genotypes and molecular markers to specific NPS within AD and other neuropsychiatric traits at the single-cell level, an unprecedented level of resolution. In addition, we will test the translational potential of the genotype-marker-phenotype models to predict AD-NPS using independent large-scale biobank datasets, in which genotypes and electronic health records are available. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have immediate utility by generating potential biomarkers for NPS diagnosis and prognosis and by providing predictive models for patient stratification in clinical trials. In the longer term, our models will help us create a blueprint for therapeutic strategies and interventions to treat NPS in AD. PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, that contributes to early institutionalization and causes substantial caregiving and caregiver burden. Despite decades of research, reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias have not been found. The proposed studies will generate and integrate high-dimensional phenomics and genomics data in human brain tissue, that will inform us about the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in the context of AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses.",Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease,9905727,R01AG067025,"['Adverse effects', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epitopes', 'Factor Analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutionalization', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Quality of life', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'brain tissue', 'care giving burden', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular marker', 'neuropathology', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'severe mental illness', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,1925544,0.2694808033447172
"Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate is an epileptologist and neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, whose long-term career goal is to become an independent- ly funded translational investigator with expertise at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive co-morbidities. The ability to translate the clinical experience, research tools, and intellectual framework from the field of epilepsy to that of the neurodegenerative diseases, and vice versa, could be a powerful approach to studying both processes. During the proposed training period, the candidate will combine her prior training in epilepsy, EEG signal processing, and machine learning, with newly acquired skills in neuroimaging (functional MRI), biostatistics, and additional clinical exposure to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Cash, an expert in epilepsy and neurophysiologic signal processing, and the co-mentorship of Dr. Reisa Sperling, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuroimaging approaches, the candidate proposes to: 1) Delineate the spectrum of epileptiform activity in early stages of AD and develop computa- tional tools to identify this activity; 2) Establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie epileptiform activity in AD; and 3) Determine how epileptiform abnormalities are associated with cognitive trajectories in patients with early stage AD. Visual and computational analysis of 24- hour scalp EEGs will be integrated with resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements, amy- loid PET imaging, and longitudinal cognitive testing from subjects with AD, to develop a com- prehensive understanding of the role of epileptiform abnormalities in early stages of AD. In addi- tion to the research proposed, the candidate’s career development plan entails rigorous coursework and seminars, practical hands-on experience, and close guidance from a board of academic advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow the candidate to establish a clinical and research niche at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases, and to develop a comprehensive toolbox with which to probe human brain function from the standpoint of neurophysiology, structure, connectivity, and tar- geted pathology. Collectively, these will form the foundation for a successful career as an inde- pendent investigator pursuing important clinical and translational research projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, or both. Project Narrative People with Alzheimer’s disease are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and people with epilepsy commonly suffer from impairments in memory and cognition. Our goals are to better understand the interplay between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and to determine whether epileptiform activity may be a treatable contributor to cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. This has important public health implications, as according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a treatment that slows the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s disease by five-fold would reduce the number of people with severe Alzheimer’s disease from 6.5 million to 1.2 million and reduce Medicare costs by 50% by the year 2050.",Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease,9731694,K23NS101037,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Technical Expertise', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2019,200880,0.15163632965214582
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9768245,UH3NS100599,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Microscopic', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Public Health', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sclerosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'White Matter Disease', 'age related', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo evaluation', 'in vivo imaging', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'pathology imaging', 'protective factors', 'treatment response', 'vascular risk factor']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH3,2019,1152217,0.09357514952780385
"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens. Feasibility rests with prior studies on evolution, networks, systems, and text-mining that demonstrate accurate predictions of deleterious mutations and their clinical sequelae and the discovery of drivers of diseases. Broadly, this work will yield proof of principle for a novel quantitative model that integrates fundamental concepts from mathematics and molecular evolution, and for a low resolution but large-scale map of biomedical knowledge in which network notions of distance computed by machine learning identify relevant functional hypothesis that would otherwise be easily overlooked. The result will be a new experimental ability to unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship in Alzheimer's Disease so as to guide drug therapy. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease projected to rise dramatically in our aging population. To develop drugs against it, we propose to train machine learning on the DNA of patients with Alzheimer's to detect genes with abnormal mathematical features in their mutations. Then, we will place these genes in a “map”, which represents a large fraction of biomedical knowledge in a high-dimensional network. The drugs that fall near our genes of interest in this map are our candidates, and experiments will test in cell and mouse models whether they affect the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's.",A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs,9787309,R01AG061105,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Animal Model', 'Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Behavior', 'Calculi', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Production', 'PubMed', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'database structure', 'disorder risk', 'drug testing', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interest', 'molecular modeling', 'mouse model', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'protective factors', 'screening', 'stem', 'success', 'synergism', 'tau Proteins', 'text searching', 'virtual']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,792498,0.0927567374263761
"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,9907480,R44AG060857,"['Affect', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Clocks', 'Building Codes', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Feeds', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Phototherapy', 'Planet Earth', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Wakefulness', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'active control', 'alertness', 'appropriate dose', 'awake', 'base', 'biological systems', 'circadian', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'design', 'dosage', 'experience', 'falls', 'feeding', 'field study', 'health data', 'improved', 'interest', 'meter', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prototype', 'residence', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIA,"ERIK PAGE AND ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2019,1240470,0.1732898796559532
"Network Modelling of Multimodal Dynamics in Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is caused by misfolded proteins that march through brain circuits trans-neuronally, causing stereotyped patterns of damage to the brain over decades of progression, and increasing clinical and cognitive impairments. Using new imaging techniques, spatiotemporal mapping of the biomarkers of AD, including of atrophy, metabolism, and pathology deposition, are becoming possible. However, the precise relationship of these biomarkers to each other is not known. These factors, coupled with insidious onset, clinical heterogeneity, overlap with other dementias and variability in progression, make a rigorous characterization and prognosis difficult. Although the “trans-neuronal” mechanism of pathology naturally suggests that pathology spread must follow the brain's fiber connectivity, existing methods of predicting progression and cognitive decline do not currently exploit the network information, relying instead on phenomenological or statistical approaches unanchored in the biophysics of networked spread. These gaps hinder understanding of the biophysical mechanism underlying dementias, and preclude accurate quantitative predictors of patients' future trajectory. The objective of this application is to learn, test and apply biophysical models of networked spread in AD. Our central hypothesis is that once a patient's baseline disease status is known, all subsequent disease-related processes are enacted on the brain's fiber connectivity network, i.e. the “connectome”, in a fully predictable manner. Influence of genetic and environmental actors is already factored in the baseline data. This project will build on and extend our recent novel graph theoretic Network Diffusion model, which mathematically captures the process of trans-neuronal network spread, and is ideally suited for investigating these issues. With this network model as a foundation, we will bring together all key elements of the causal AD progression chain. Then, using human imaging data (atrophy from MRI, Aβ from AV45-PET, tau from T807-PET and metabolism from FDG-PET) from the public ADNI study, we will mathematically characterize 1) network-based spread of tau and amyloid-beta, 2) the relationship between tau deposition and regional atrophy, and amyloid deposition and regional metabolism. Next, these validated models will be entered in a state-space generative mode of progression that will predict future spatial patterns of the biomarkers. An alternative deep learning approach will also be developed as a comparison with the proposed biophysical modeling approach. Success of this proposal could have wide implications in treatment, care, planning and monitoring of dementia in susceptible populations. Our long-term goal is to develop a common connectome-based biophysics model underlying all dementias, forming the core of novel computational diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's Disease is the most widespread and debilitating age-related degenerative disorder, with more than 40 million elderly subjects affected worldwide and $600 billion in care-related expenses. This project will investigate the network spread of the pathogens involved in the disease, and from that information, build a tracking and predictive software. If successful, this will give a computational diagnostic and prognostic tool with wide implications in the treatment, care, planning and monitoring of dementia in susceptible populations.",Network Modelling of Multimodal Dynamics in Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia,9687400,RF1AG062196,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Animal Model', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Vitro', 'Information Networks', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medial', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Work', 'abeta deposition', 'age related', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease heterogeneity', 'early detection biomarkers', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'frontal lobe', 'human imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'misfolded protein', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'patient variability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prion-like', 'prognostic tool', 'regional atrophy', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",RF1,2019,2955738,0.08799622252521042
"US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although dementia has a global impact, efforts to address ensuing challenges have come mostly from high- income countries (HICs). Whereas the prevalence and incidence of dementia appear to be stable or declining in such countries, an alarmingly opposite tendency typifies South American countries (SAC). This scenario proves even more challenging due to region-specific traits. First, the particular genetic and environmental backgrounds of SAC limit the generalizability of key findings from HICs. Moreover, the greater genetic diversity and impact of socioeconomic status (SES) of SAC remain markedly understudied. Of note, this is true of the four largest SAC (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), representing over 75% of the region’s population. In addition, SAC face a dearth of innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional studies on two of their most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is thus critical for SAC to join ongoing international efforts and develop a gold-standard approach for detecting disease-specific alterations in a context of methodological, genetic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity. Against this background, our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD presentation in SAC relative to the US. To this end, we will establish a cohort to test large samples from the four abovementioned SAC, as well as the US (totaling > 3000 participants, including 1500 controls, 750 AD patients, and 750 FTD patients). We will combine standardized clinical assessments with innovative analytical techniques including multimodal machine learning to account for heterogeneity in these diverse populations. By combining standardized genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (SES-cognitive) measures, we will test the underlying hypothesis that there are unique risk factors for AD and FTD in SAC which do not prove significant in US populations. More particularly, we will aim to (a) establish genetic risk to AD and FTD in diverse SAC cohorts; (b) test whether patients from SAC and the US can be discriminated after accounting for how SES affects cognitive and brain imaging signatures; and (c) determine genetic, cognitive, cerebral, and socioeconomic factors that discriminate among SAC vs. US patients. Positive impacts of this work include a better understanding of the genetic and socioeconomic factors driving neurocognitive manifestations of dementia, and the identification of novel genetic targets for risk reduction and disease prevention in SAC. Our large multimodal, cross-sectional study will enable clinical assessment of understudied patient groups, extend and harmonize existing data sets, and prompt the development of novel measures and multimodal machine learning protocols. More generally, by establishing a collaborative framework which capitalizes on unique regional populations, our proposal can consolidate a SAC-based platform for future translational research and assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although the prevalence and incidence of dementia appears to be stable or declining in high-income countries, South American countries (SAC) face the opposite scenario, with increased dementia prevalence, probably triggered by a combination of genetic and socioeconomic status (SES) factors. This proposal aims to create the first SAC-based multicenter initiative to study dementia, by combining genomic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (cognitive, clinical, socioeconomic) data.

"Decoding the regulatory architecture across brain cell types in Alzheimer's Disease In this supplement to our ENCODE4 project, we will analyze functional genomics data from up to 7 major brain regions in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients and healthy controls. These data include both bulk tissue and single cell assays. We will use these data to generate brain cell-type specific regulatory maps in AD cases and controls, and to understand the processes of dysregulation in AD. We will additionally use these data, supplemented with public data, to identify critical cell types for AD progression, causal variants, target genes and regulatory networks in AD cases and controls. Finally, we will validate regulatory variants using MPRAs and CRISPR experiments in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. In summary, this supplement will enable us to provide high-resolution maps of chromatin function and healthy and diseased brains, and to link disease-associated variants to likely functional roles. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this supplemental project is to apply powerful new computational and functional genomics methods to identify causal cell types, genes and variants in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

"Dementia and Heart Failure in the Community In response to PA-17-089, we propose exploratory analyses with an existing epidemiologic heart failure (HF) cohort linked to electronic health record (EHR) data to address the combined burden of coexisting Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and HF. We will capitalize on the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) and apply novel data science methods to existing community datasets. Recent adverse trends in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality are due to a major increase in HF deaths, and the uncontrolled epidemic of HF compromises progress against CVD. Addressing the epidemic of HF, a disease of aging populations, requires understanding how coexisting conditions interact with HF to impact outcomes and health care utilization. AD/ADRD occupies a distinct position within coexisting conditions as HF increases the risk of AD/ADRD, in part, via shared pathways. However, this association and, in particular, which phenotype of the heterogeneous HF syndrome is associated with AD/ADRD is not well known. AD/ADRD can adversely impact the outcomes of HF, a serious chronic disease that requires effective self-management and cognitive skills.  Yet, how AD/ADRD impacts health care utilization and outcomes in HF is not well understood. These knowledge gaps can be addressed by secondary analyses of existing data. Our objectives are to study, in an epidemiological cohort, the characteristics of HF that impart a higher risk of AD/ADRD, and the impact of AD/ADRD on outcomes (death, cardiovascular events, hospitalizations and admission to skilled nursing facility). Our proposal directly addresses key points of the PA, such as “Effects of specific combinations of two or more comorbid conditions on risks for specific adverse health outcomes, impact of specific combinations of two or more chronic conditions, …interactions among disease processes, and health outcomes in complex older patients with multiple chronic conditions.” This work will capitalize on a large epidemiological HF cohort linked to comprehensive EHR data within the rich environment of the REP, optimally suited to our proposed secondary analyses. This proposal leverages the experience of our team with the epidemiology of HF and with novel data science methods readily applicable to secondary analyses of existing EHR data sets. Aim 1 will apply machine learning to discover HF phenotypes associated with AD/ADRD while considering cardiac function, occurrence of atrial fibrillation and other coexisting conditions. Aim 2 will evaluate the impact of AD/ADRD on outcomes of HF. Conducting this work in a cohort within a geographically defined population and extensive longitudinal follow up will ensure that our results reflect the experience of community patients with HF. An improved understanding of the coexistence of AD/ADRD and HF will establish the prevalence of this association in the community and characterize the type of HF associated with AD/ADRD, which may allow earlier diagnosis, thereby enabling interventions to prevent or forestall early disease. Finally, improving our knowledge of how AD/ADRD affects outcomes will foster more precise management.

"Naturalistic Event Representation as a Novel Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease By 2060, the number of Americans 65 and older is projected to more than double from 46 million to 98 million, 24% of the total population. With this comes an increased prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which will create significant burden on our society and government. At present, screening tools capable of differentiating healthy aging from AD are most effective a decade or more after the preclinical stage, when potential treatments would be most effective. Thus, discovery of novel and specific tools for assessing the aging brain are of utmost importance. Typical studies of cognitive ability involve recognition of learned objects or simple word associations. However, in real-world situations, the content of an event is segmented from a flow of multimodal information. Segmentation and representation of events is supported by a posterior-medial network (PMN) of brain areas. Critically, this very same brain network features the first regions affected by pathological accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ), a key characteristic of AD. A recent report from an NIA working group defined asymptomatic Aβ accumulation as the earliest indicator of preclinical AD. Given the functional role of the PMN, we propose that this stage of disease may not be truly asymptomatic: subtle functional deficits may be evident if properly probed. To address this, we have developed a naturalistic paradigm to characterize event representation in the brain and subsequent memory. We aim to test the novel hypotheses that the brain’s ability to segment and represent complex events is compromised in preclinical AD, and that the extent of this disruption is predictive of deficient memory for the experienced events. We will acquire functional MRI (fMRI) scans while participants view a video narrative depicting naturalistic scenarios. We will additionally test memory performance related to details of the events depicted in the video both in and out of the scanner. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and machine learning analyses of functional MRI (fMRI) data, we will examine differences in the way the brain represents events into advanced aging in participants with and without ‘asymptomatic’ amyloid deposition (status obtained via existing PET scan data). This combination of approaches is highly innovative because current translational measures do not assess memory for rich, dynamic events that make up the majority of real-world experience. This project is expected to significantly improve our understanding of neural and cognitive disruptions that differentiate healthy aging from preclinical AD. By studying how the brain chunks and represents events, and how this relates to memory for those events, we can reveal significant insights into the way AD-related pathology affects day-to-day living. This can provide a mechanistic framework for understanding subtle, subjective memory complaints. The results of this work are anticipated to significantly advance our understanding of memory decline in the earliest possible stages of AD, providing a mechanistic basis for subtle issues that have to date been difficult to assess in the clinic. The ability to parse and represent complex events is a cornerstone of cognition and memory, and is dramatically affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The goal of this project is to use brain imaging and behavioral tests to understand how neural event representations are impacted by preclinical AD compared to healthy aging. The results will help us to understand early differences between healthy aging and AD, and it will help clinicians to develop novel screening tools.",Naturalistic Event Representation as a Novel Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease,9737104,R03AG063224,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Related Memory Disorders', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'abeta accumulation', 'abeta deposition', 'aging brain', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'movie', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2019,157000,0.14586451666286632
"Developing mobile software that uses visual mapping techniques as habit-based assistive technology for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias and their caregivers Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) are age-associated neurodegenerative diseases that are reaching epidemic proportions. Progression of AD is characterized by losses in memory, orientation, independent decision-making capacity, and self-care. Gains in understanding AD pathogenesis have not yet translated into pharmacological therapies that effectively slow or halt disease progression. Evidence-based behavioral approaches are rapidly becoming recognized as methods to provide effective neurocognitive and therapeutic support for AD/ADRD patients and their caregivers1.  Behavioral approaches such as lifestyle changes and risk reduction are non-pharmacological therapies that are accessible, personalizable, have no side effects, and are low in cost. To that end, we are developing mobile device software that is patient and caregiver centered, and provides behavioral-based assistance through visual mapping. The MapHabitTM system (MHS) uses pictures and keywords to assist memory- impaired patients and caregivers in organizing and successfully accomplishing their activities of daily living. This approach is innovative through its unique recruitment of the brain’s habit learning system (neostriatum) rather than the hippocampal structures damaged in AD. Preliminary work revealed that commercially available visual mapping software is too complicated for memory-impaired and technology-naïve individuals to use effectively. Commercially available software is proprietary and cannot be modified to meet their needs.  In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we propose to further develop and enhance MHS by integrating three novel specific aims that involve (1) development of adaptive user interfaces which can be personalized and dynamically adjusted for cognitive status, allowing for a greater range of memory-impaired individuals to benefit from visual mapping; (2) linkage of personalized visual maps to smart devices, including wearables (e.g., Apple iWatch) and audio interfaces (e.g., Amazon Echo); (3) establishment of a predictive analytics tool that will accurately track and predict changes in functional status.  We are advantaged in this SBIR Phase 1 application by having access to patients and caregivers, including underrepresented minority populations, who are currently involved in our preliminary studies assessing the impact of visual mapping on quality of life measures. All of these individuals are already well- characterized in terms of their cognitive and emotional behavior, both before and after the use of visual mapping (see letters of support from Dr. E. Vaughn, Atlanta VA Health Care System, Dr. M. Parker, Emory University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and F. Boatman, RN, Speak Life Management). Those studies will contribute to the preliminary data section of our planned SBIR Phase 2 application that will: assess the effectiveness of MHS on a broad range of large clinical populations, improve the user-experience for memory-impaired individuals, and refine our methods of machine learning to predict healthcare outcomes. Impressive gains in our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have not created therapies that are safe and effective. We are developing the MapHabitTM system, an application for mobile devices that is safe, non- invasive, and low in cost, which helps memory-impaired individuals and caregivers accomplish activities and improve independent function. This is done by using a technique called visual mapping to utilize areas of the brain that are not damaged by AD.",Developing mobile software that uses visual mapping techniques as habit-based assistive technology for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias and their caregivers,9848374,R43AG065081,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Businesses', 'Bypass', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Epidemic', 'Feedback', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neostriatum', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonpharmacologic Therapy', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk Reduction', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Unconscious State', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'digital', 'emotional behavior', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional status', 'habit learning', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'smart watch', 'software development', 'success', 'visual map', 'wearable device']",NIA,"MAPHABIT, INC.",R43,2019,498609,0.09798310288094297
"Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology. Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple health threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, efforts in drug discovery and repurposing for the treatment of AD have had limited success. The failure is largely attributed to the adoption of a reductionist model of “one-drug-one-gene- one-disease”. As AD is a multi-facet complex disease, a new treatment approach is urgently needed to simultaneously target multiple pathological processes responsible for the onset and progress of AD, some of which are also common to other diseases that cause dementia. In this application, we will develop an innovative translational bioinformatics approach to addressing challenges in AD drug discovery. Our approach is based on a new paradigm of systems pharmacology, which focuses on defining multiple targets to a single drug or a drug combination, and studying the effect of the drug(s) on perturbing disease-causing networks. Over the last ten years, we have developed a novel structural systems pharmacology (SSP) platform that can predict genome-wide high-resolution protein-chemical interactions and correlate molecular interactions with phenotype responses. The SSP platform synergistically combines novel methods from machine learning, bioinformatics, biophysics, and systems biology. We have successfully applied the SSP platform to drug repurposing, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, precision medicine, and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, and in close collaborations with experimental laboratories, we will develop, and rigorously test a novel SSP approach to AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology. Firstly, we will develop a drug-gene-disease multi-layered network model (MULAN) that links FDA-approved drugs with neurodegenerative diseases through protein-chemical interactions, gene- disease associations, and chemical-disease associations through integrating multiple omics data. Secondly, we will improve and apply our proven successful SSP platform, which can accurately infer novel relations from sparse and noisy MULAN, to identify safe FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed for AD treatment. Finally, we will experimentally test FDA-approved drugs identified for their binding activity of drug targets and anti-AD potency in cell and animal models. The successful completion of this project will provide an integrated computational modeling framework for AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology as well as identify novel targeted anti-AD therapeutics toward pre-clinical trials. Relevance Statement Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, AD is a complex disease that has been extremely hard to treat with the conventional approach.

"Rhode Island Center for Clinical and Translational Science Abstract. The identification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prior to the onset of clinical symptoms is critical in order to avert an impending public health crisis. Thus far, clinical trials of secondary prevention interventions have lacked cost- and time-efficiency. This is due to the absence of validated minimally invasive, cost effective, and widely accessible AD risk detection biomarkers. The development of an AD risk detection algorithm comprised of readily available information, including these biomarkers, is essential to identify potential targets for secondary prevention while minimizing cost. Thus far, development of these algorithms have been hampered by lack of collaboration across disciplines, failure to apply advanced and novel statistical techniques, and the complex pathophysiology of the underlying disease. Building on the parent Advance CTR study (U54GM115677; PI: Padbury) with the goal of generating translational research projects across Rhode Island Institutions, the proposed work fosters collaboration between the Brown Center for Biomedical Informatics, the Quantitative Sciences Program at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, the Butler Hospital Memory & Aging Program (MAP), and the University of Rhode Island. Co-I’s Brick and Sarkar will apply advanced analytic and machine learning techniques to existing internal (Butler MAP Alzheimer’s Prevention Registry) and external (GAAIN) datasets to develop, test, and validate an AD risk detection algorithm. They will work with Co-I’s (Alber, Lee) on the MAP staff to collect prospective biomarker data (amyloid PET, retinal imaging, blood based- biomarkers) to improve and refine this algorithm, providing the springboard for a dynamic dataset based at Brown that can be used to develop and validate novel AD risk biomarkers in the state of Rhode Island. Project Narrative. Over five million adults in the United States are affected by Alzheimer’s disease and this number is rising. The development of a widely accessible, minimally invasive, cost-effective method for early detection is a global public health imperative. The overarching goal of this study is to develop a sustainable database of AD risk markers to be used for collaborative research and to develop a risk algorithm that will identify individuals at risk for AD at the earliest pathologic stage, prior to the onset of clinical symptoms.",Rhode Island Center for Clinical and Translational Science,9881461,U54GM115677,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Failure', 'Family history of', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cerebral amyloidosis', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'health data', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'minimally invasive', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health priorities', 'recruit', 'retinal imaging', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'translational scientist']",NIGMS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,U54,2019,413394,0.18285922138558308
"PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in adults over the age of 65, and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the leading cause of dementia in middle age, with the behavioral variant subtype (bvFTD) being the most prevalent form. The relationships between clinical syndromes and pathological causes are complex, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult. For example, multiple studies have indicated that a significant proportion of cases of AD-like dementia show evidence of non-AD pathology, such as inclusions of the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein associated with clinical FTD. Also, AD neuropathology has been found in 15–30% of patient with the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers will be needed, so that they can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient populations. In this project, we will focus on clinically diagnosed bvFTD and AD patients, and apply machine learning to multimodal neuroimaging (T1, FDG-PET) data pooled from large, multisite studies of AD and FTD. Our goal is to develop novel biomarkers that can differentiate bvFTD, AD and controls. Our hypothesis is that each neuropathology is associated with a distinct biomarker signature, and these signatures can be discovered through well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical profiles. We will use available amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of β-amyloid and tau to assess the robustness of our predictions of AD neuropathologies. In Aim 1 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal structural imaging to develop predictive biomarker models for differentiating bvFTD vs. AD. In Aim 2 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal FDG-PET imaging to develop predictive biomarker models. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the combination of structural and FDG-PET imaging as predictive biomarker models.  Relevance: This research supports NIH initiatives on long-term, personalized precision medicine and big data science. Our predictive biomarker models can inform participant selection in clinical trials so that we can identify disease-modifying treatments with greater power. Our system-biology approach can enable us to generate new questions on mechanisms underlying the origin and progression of neuro-pathological processes, create new data and computational tools that can in turn generate new insights and new hypotheses. NARRATIVE  Accurate diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is difficult because the relationships between clinical syndromes, and pathological and genetic causes are complex. In this project, we propose to use machine learning technologies to develop powerful predictive biomarkers that can distinguish bvFTD, AD and healthy controls, using well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical data from multiple national databases. As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient populations.",PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis,9745494,R01AG055121,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'accurate diagnosis', 'amyloid imaging', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'biomarker development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'mutation carrier', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non-alzheimer dementia', 'novel marker', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'search engine', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'tau Proteins']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,634449,0.1920546167742397
"Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer Disease (AD), and the existing studies have suggested that the individuals with amnestic MCI tend to progress to probable AD at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year. Early prediction of MCI patients with high risk of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Recent advances in acquiring multi-dimensional and longitudinal brain imaging and genome-wide array data provide exciting new opportunities to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. Integrating such multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data holds great promise for a system biology of the brain to better understand the complex neurobiological mechanism of conversion of MCI to AD. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these neuroimaging genomic data sets have presented critical computational challenges for achieving the full transformative potential from comprehensive joint analysis of these heterogeneous and longitudinal data sets. This project aims to address these emerging challenges for early prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion with four aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel sparse bi-multivariate learning model based system biology framework for analysis of genome-wide association results across a large number of the structural and functional phenotypes derived from neuroimaging scans of the whole brain. Our new methods are designed for bi-multivariate analysis of high-throughput genomic data and complex Quantitative Traits (QTs) related to MCI-to-AD conversion by utilizing the system biology knowledge. Aim 2 is to further extend the learning approaches in Aim 1 with the new structured sparse models to the multi-dimensional data integration methods to identify the heterogeneous biomarkers from multiscale interrelated imaging genomic data for outcome prediction. Meanwhile, we will utilize the joint multi-task learning scheme to identify the stable genetic and phenotypic biomarkers that are associated with cognitive functions decline and MCI-to-AD conversion simultaneously. Based on the studies in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 is focused on revealing the longitudinal biomarkers of the changes of MCI progression or cognitive impairment by a new structured low-rank multi-task regression model. These biomarkers can fully differentiate longitudinal profiles of relevant QTs and better capture genetic associations with QT changes over time. Aim 4 is to evaluate and validate our proposed machine learning and bioinformatics algorithms on both synthetic data and real imaging genomic data. The results of this project will be able to efficiently improve our understanding of the complex neurobiological mechanism underlying the MCI-to-AD conversion. The identified biomarkers will finally enhance the early and accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion such that the clinical treatment can be provided in time. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Existing research works mainly focus on the studies using single genetic or neuroimaging data source and seldom consider the longitudinal data profiles. To address these limitations, this project focuses on 1) the development of novel bioinformatics and machine learning models for solving the computational challenges of analyzing the emerging multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data, and 2) identification of biomarkers with prediction power on MCI-to-AD conversion from the large and complex heterogeneous imaging genomic data with the comprehensive system biology knowledge guidance.",Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction,9766175,R01AG049371,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'case control', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multi-task learning', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multitask', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'serial imaging', 'simulation', 'success', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,397930,0.1891014609949589
"Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting 1 in 8 individuals over 65 years old in the US. Within AD, approximately 40-60% individuals are affected by psychotic symptoms (AD+P), which are associated with more rapid cognitive decline, greater disability, mortality and caregiver burden, resulting in a disproportionately large disease burden. Recent studies indicate a genetic basis for AD+P risk, but the molecular basis of AD+P remains largely uncharacterized, hindering the search for appropriate treatments and novel therapeutics. In this proposal, we seek to systematically dissect the mechanistic basis of AD+P by systematic generation, integration, and experimental dissection of transcriptional and epigenomic phenotypes across two brain regions and four cell types. (1) We profile single-cell RNA-seq and cell-type specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq across 192 post-mortem brain samples, each in two regions across AD patients with psychosis, AD patients with no psychosis, schizophrenia patients with no AD, and control individuals. (2) We integrate the resulting datasets with genetic information and GWAS data to predict driver genes, regions, variants, and pathways underlying AD+P using state-of-the-art machine learning methods for causality, mediation analysis, and genetic Bayesian fine- mapping. (3) We use our computational predictions to guide a systematic dissection of the molecular underpinnings of AD+P using a modular and programmable CRISPR-Cas9 methodology in iPSC lines to modulate regulatory elements, genes and alleles, and measure the resulting molecular and cellular phenotypes in cell-autonomous and non-autonomous phenotypes. If successful, this ambitious proposal has the potential to provide the first mechanistic insights on the development of psychotic symptoms in AD+P and/or P-AD, reveal functional risk variants and target genes for therapeutic intervention that will likely influence clinical management in order to alleviate the personal and societal burden associated with these disorders.

"The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Genomic studies for late-onset AD (LOAD) have identified over 20 risk loci; however, translating the relevant molecules identified by genomics to AD-specific mechanistic pathways has been challenging. Our application, entitled “The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline Revealed by Next- Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,” is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing a uniquely innovative molecular imaging platform called multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) that will determine high dimensional protein interactions for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomics studies in normal and pathological states. Our proposal has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze four regions in healthy aged brains: two sectors of the hippocampal pyramidal layer and from two isocortical regions. Next- generation MIBI instrumentation will be used to image simultaneously 30+ proteins that mark subtypes of neurons, synapses, and non-neuronal cells, while covering regulatory signaling, neuro-inflammatory components, and AD risk gene protein products with subcellular resolution. In Aim 2, we propose to use the same multiplexed imaging methods in AD brain stratified by APOE genotype. We will analyze these data with statistical machine learning methods already established in our laboratory, similar to what we have done previously with different cancers and the immune system. In Aim 3, using infrastructure we have already have established, we will create a web-based portal where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi- color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features we derive shared freely. We propose a transformative, collaborative approach to AD that leverages a long-standing NIA-funded longitudinal cohort and is highly responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan. These novel insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets and will create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD. Project Narrative AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate a phenotypic landscape of cognitive decline, to understand modulation of cognitive decline during compensation and relate genetic predisposition to changes in phenotypic landscape defined by muti-parametric measurements using enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI).  ",The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,9692598,R01AG056287,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Electrons', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Middle frontal gyrus structure', 'Molecular', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'burden of illness', 'collaborative approach', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'disability', 'gene product', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'mental state', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'multiplexed\xa0imaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'symposium']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,525940,0.2274197174991437
"Identification and Characterization of Common Pathways across Alzheimer Disease Genotypes using a Multiomic Approach Alzheimer disease (AD) is a multigenic and multifactorial condition with a common pathological hallmark, deposition of Aβ and tau proteins aggregates in the brain. A few genes have been directly involved in the protein deposition metabolism. Another 24 loci have been identified as risk factors for AD which have shed light into other impaired mechanisms. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how all these pathways are interrelated towards a same ending phenotype. Omic technologies have been instrumental in complementing our understanding of the pathways involved between disruption of particular loci and final pathology. However, each one of these studies only explains a modest portion of the pathology of AD, whilst complex diseases involve a highly dynamic and interactive system of molecular layers. The central hypothesis is that different molecular layers are interconnected in AD so that the dysregulation of any of these causes the ultimate AD phenotype (Aβ and tau proteins aggregates). Multi-omic analysis can provide an insight into how different molecular dimensions interact with each other, an insight that single omic data cannot provide. Also, there is limited availability of multi-omic data collected on the same group of individuals and tissue. The objective of this project is to identify dysregulated pathways consistent across molecilar layers. In the K99 phase of the award, I plan to generate single-omic profiles (transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) from brain tissue from highly characterized individuals. I will also leverage existing GWAs data for these individuals to conduct pair-wise integrative analysis to identify common variants that act as genetic regulators (QTL) for the identified dysregulated molecular markers. To conduct these analyses, I will gain training in network and pathway analysis, but also in big data and machine learning methods. During this period, I will also receive training in handling of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) and in functional analysis. Preliminary analysis using transcriptomic data have identified AGFG2 gene to be overexpressed across AD etiologies compared to controls. AGFG2 is an astrocyte expressed gene that seems to be involved in Aβ metabolism. During the K99 phase I will examine the role of AGFG2 in iPSC-derived astrocytes from AD patients' carriers of known pathogenic mutations (ADAD). Having acquired this knowledge, during the R00 phase I will explore whether dysregulation of AGFG2 has the same effect in ADAD as in iPSC-derived astrocytes from early onset and late onset AD patients. Finally, I will elevate the pair-wise integration of omic data to a meta-dimensional level. This will allow me to identify molecular signals (transcripts, proteins, metabolites) that are consistent across molecular layers. If successful, this project has the potential to reveal novel insights of AD biology, which will be of interest to the scientific community. In addition, with this award I will develop a translational profile which will be invaluable for establishing me as an independent investigator in the growing field of systems biology. Project Narrative This study will use multi-omic data from brain tissue from Alzheimer disease (AD) cases and healthy individuals to identify biological abnormalities that are consistent across molecular layers which will be validated on iPSc.

"Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction Project Summary/Abstract  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects millions of Americans, yet there are no treatments that meaningfully affect disease progression once symptoms manifest. This has shifted the focus to early detection and intervention, which is thought by many researchers to offer the best chance of slowing or stopping the progression of AD. However, trials aimed at averting the underlying causes of disease have proven difficult because pathological changes in AD happen well in advance of cognitive decline. A widely-available genetic test for determining AD risk early in life, while prevention might still be possible, would allow early treatment intervention, enrollment in clinical trials, and improved patient stratification for testing treatment effectiveness. However, despite recent advancements, genetic risk prediction models (GRPMs) for late-onset AD (LOAD) lack sufficient discrimination ability to support such applications. Given the lack of effective treatments once symptoms have manifested and the socioeconomic consequences at stake, there is a serious unmet need for a widely-available GRPM able to accurately assess a patient's risk in middle age or earlier, before neurodegeneration begins.  To address this need, Parabon has teamed with AD researchers from Washington University and Emory to develop a GRPM able to accurately predict an individual's risk of developing LOAD at various ages. Phase I demonstrated that this GRPM, which exploits diagnostic heterogeneity, non-additive (epistatic) interactions among variants, and machine learning, significantly outperforms traditional risk factors. In Phase II, the GRPM will be further optimized, validated, and commercialized as a direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic health risk assessment test. In Aim 1, thousands of new and existing case and control subjects with genotypes and detailed phenotypes will be added. In Aim 2, novel approaches to feature selection for epistatic interactions will be implemented to increase the generalizability of selected features. In Aim 3, the selected genomic features will be used to predict imaging and biomarker endophenotypes of LOAD. In Aim 4, the out- of-sample endophenotype predictions will be combined into a final predictive model for AD diagnosis that can be applied to new subjects at any age, which will be validated in an independent replication set. Finally, in Aim 5, data and results will be prepared for scientific publication and submission to the FDA for marketing authorization as a DTC genetic health risk assessment system. Project Narrative Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects millions of Americans, yet there are no treatments that significantly slow disease progression once symptoms manifest, making early intervention crucial to reduce the individual and societal burden of this disease. This proposal seeks to create a genetic risk prediction model that can predict an individual's AD risk at any age, which will be made widely available as a direct-to-consumer genetic health risk assessment. It will enable early intervention and life planning for at-risk individuals and allow researchers to maximize the probability of detecting treatment effects in clinical trials by assessing patients' underlying disease risk.",Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction,9786181,R44AG050366,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area', 'Authorization documentation', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'biobank', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'middle age', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment effect', 'whole genome']",NIA,"PARABON NANOLABS, INC.",R44,2019,414285,0.17285600756894426
"The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD Project Summary Improving vascular health for delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is identified as a critical goal by the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Conference, the 2015 NIA AD Summit and PAR-15-356 (to which this application is responding). Yet, critical barriers exist to implementing vascular prevention strategies for AD, and elucidating the role of midlife metabolic, macro- and micro- vascular factors in AD is essential to addressing these barriers. Each type of factor may manifest different pathologies in the brain that contribute to dementia sub-types, making a new and sufficiently comprehensive clinical trial a costly and time-consuming undertaking. To address this essential gap, we propose to leverage the rich longitudinal cohort data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study with the addition of detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain neuroimaging – the MESA VASCAD study. MESA participants at the Wake Forest site (46% African-American, 54% non-Hispanic Caucasian) have already undergone extensive metabolic and vascular phenotyping, repeated retinal imaging and a brief cognitive assessment in 2010-2012. The MESA VASCAD study will add clinical and cognitive assessments (Uniform Data Set and supplemental cognitive tests); neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid PET); and reanalysis of retinal images. We propose to enroll 540 MESA participants in 2 years and repeat assessments 3 years later to more fully characterize targeted, modifiable vascular risk factors for AD. Through our Specific Aims, we will (1) test the hypothesis that baseline macrovascular and microvascular biomarkers in middle-age predict both standard AD neuroimaging outcomes (e.g. hippocampal volume and amyloid deposition assessed with PET) and more novel cerebrovascular biomarkers (e.g. microinfarcts, lacunar infarcts, neurite density and cerebral microbleeds); (2) determine if changes in metabolic and vascular biomarkers over 15 years predict cognitive and AD biomarker trajectory; and (3) using high-dimensional machine learning approaches, determine common, differential and interactive metabolic and vascular risk factor profiles among racial and APOE genotype groups. This proposed ancillary study, approved by the MESA Steering Committee, is led by a New Investigator with an experienced, multi- disciplinary team of collaborators. The MESA study is an ideal cohort for interrogating the questions in this proposal: it has highly detailed longitudinal risk factor data collected over 15+ years in a diverse cohort, which we can leverage and augment with cerebrovascular biomarkers, AD biomarkers, and cognitive reassessments - thereby creating a comprehensive brain phenotype dataset for vascular and AD risk factors. These new data will enable us to examine the timing and impact of vascular biomarkers on dementia biomarkers and cognitive trajectories before a diagnosis of pre-clinical and clinical AD-related disorders, meeting a critical gap in information that will help guide the development of novel therapeutic or prevention strategies for various forms of AD-related dementias. Project Narrative Vascular and metabolic disorders are proposed as potent modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and may provide key routes for therapeutic and preventive interventions. We propose to leverage the vast resources of the NIH-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study to examine the potential contributions of macrovascular and microvascular subclinical disease to AD-related pathology. At the Wake Forest MESA site, we will add neuroimaging, repeated cognitive testing, and reprocessing of existing digital retinal scans with novel measures of retinal microvascular architecture.",The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD,9733853,R01AG054069,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Age-Years', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Ancillary Study', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurites', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Route', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vascular Diseases', 'adjudicate', 'age related', 'arterial stiffness', 'brain health', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcium', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'digital', 'epigenetic marker', 'experience', 'falls', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'macrovascular disease', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pre-clinical', 'resilience', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'symposium', 'vascular contributions', 'vascular factor', 'vascular risk factor']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,763149,0.22363353595597946
"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology. The completion of our study aims will advance the development of an affordable screening tool that can be utilized in a clinical/community setting to identify individuals who are candidates for comprehensive diagnostic testing.",Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology,9691111,R01AG054523,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrum', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cost Measures', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'community clinic', 'community setting', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'glucose metabolism', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'ketogenic diet', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'minimally invasive', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'stem', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,760616,0.2503592496478446
"Construct large-scale phenomes of disease and drugs and develop data-driven systems approaches to understand genetic links between Alzheimer's disease and Neuropsychiatric symptoms PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and the most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting over 5.5 million people in United States and 47 million people worldwide. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in dementia and lead to great functional impairment, excess morbidity and mortality, and high social-economic costs in patients with AD. Currently, the genetic links between NPS and AD remains poorly characterized and there exist no effective treatments for AD and associated NPS. In this project titled “Construct large-scale phenomes of diseases and drugs and develop combined phenome- and genome-driven systems approaches to understand genetic links between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS)”, we will develop natural language processing (NLP), information extraction, knowledge representation and data integration techniques to construct a large-scale MindDiseasePhenome from 28 million biomedical articles. MindDiseasePhenome contains deep phenotypic relationships for tens of thousands of diseases, including AD and many neuropsychiatric diseases. MindDiseasePhenome is standardized using biomedical ontologies, fully annotated with biomedical literature, and extensively integrated with existing disease genetics and genomics data. We will develop NLP, information extraction, knowledge representation and data integration techniques to construct a large-scale MindDrugPhenome from 28 million biomedical articles, > 36,000 FDA drug labels, and 13 million health records. MindDrugPhenome contains side effect (SE)/phenotype information of over 8,580 drugs and 22,499 SEs (including 1,898 neurologic and 740 psychiatric SE terms). MindDrugPhenome is standardized, annotated and fully integrated with existing genetics data and biomedical ontologies. We will innovatively leverage MindDiseasePhenome and MindDrugPhenome and develop data-driven systems approach to understand genetic links between AD and NPS. We will develop interactive web applications to make all the data publicly available to the broad scientific community through AMP-AD Knowledge Portal. The unique and powerful strength of our project is our ability to seamlessly combine automatic construction of large-scale phenomes of diseases and drugs with novel data-driven systems approaches to understand genetic links between AD and NPS. Our research integrates multiple advanced computational technologies, including NLP, information extraction, knowledge representation and reasoning, data integration, network biology and data-driven genetics predictions. The unique MindDiseasePhenome and MindDrugPhenome will set the foundation to enable other computational approaches to understand the genetic links between AD and NPS. Our predicted novel genetic links between AD and NPS will enable biomedical researchers to conduct hypothesis- driven functional studies in experimental models of AD. Our project will likely lead to discovery of novel genetic links between AD and NPS with translational implications for the development of therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE !

"Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease The objective of the proposed Fast-Track SBIR effort is to develop and commercialize the Ryan CompanionBot (hereafter, Ryan), an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementia (ADRD). According to the NIA, research reports estimate that as many as 5.1 million Americans may have AD, and the number is expected to rise as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. Ryan will be designed to promote social interaction and foster engagement and rapport, and improve mood and well-being of persons with early stage AD/ADRD. In the Phase I effort, we will develop facial emotion recognition technology and integrate it with Ryan and then conduct a pilot study to understand the feasiblity and effectiveness of Ryan in fostering empathy and rapport in interaction with persons with AD/ADRD. Once validated, we will work with domain experts to design and build aestehcically pleasing Ryan V2.0 and integrate the facial expression recognition technology with a spoken- dialog system, reminders, and other intelligent features into Ryan to address the needs of persons with early stage AD/ADRD and their caregivers. If successful, DreamFace will be positioned to bring to market an affordable and effective socially-assistive robot to improve the quality of life for persons with AD/ADRD. The goal of the project is to develop a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease,9950170,R44AG059483,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Computer software', 'Cost of Illness', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Esthetics', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Face', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Measures', 'Memory Loss', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Saints', 'Serotonin', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Well in self', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'common symptom', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'geriatric depression', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'mental state', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'repetitive behavior', 'robot assistance', 'satisfaction', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'success', 'tau-1', 'tool']",NIA,"DREAM FACE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2019,667627,0.23315783450942718
"The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD The goal of this ongoing R01 is to chart the progression of pathobiologic markers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their effect on neural function and cognition in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with risk for AD. There is an appreciable gap in knowledge about the temporal disease course in this age range that this ongoing project has been directly addressing with serial multimodal imaging including amyloid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, and serial cognitive measurement. In the next funding cycle we will add a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique sensitive to fibrillar tau [F-18]THK5351 indexing neurofibrillary pathology. In the prior funding period we recruited 179 individuals from a registry of 1,545 people at risk for AD known as WRAP (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention). We found that [C-11]PIB amyloid burden is detectable in 20% of people with parental history of AD at a mean age of 60. Baseline amyloid is more extensive in the presence of higher CSF total tau levels, and 2-year increases in PiB amyloid are significantly predicted by higher baseline CSF tau. The hypothesis for this renewal is that tau- related neurofibrillar pathology begins early (in accord with the neuropathology literature) in people at AD risk and its strategic spatial burden explains changes in amyloid, neural function and cognitive decline. Aim 1: To test the premise that amyloid burden is necessary but not sufficient to evoke preclinical cognitive change. We will examine effects of longitudinal amyloid and tau change on episodic memory trajectories over time in 235 at risk individuals including all subjects we previously enrolled and follow them over 2 years with advanced multimodal imaging and CSF. Aim 2: To assess the effects of tau and amyloid imaging on MRI and CSF indicators of neural injury and function. Aim 3: To develop a multimodal disease marker to maximize efficiency of clinical trials in preclinical AD. Following our work in creating tools for efficient clinical trials in MCI, we will extend these concepts to the pre-MCI phase of disease utilizing deep learning architectures with tau, amyloid and structural imaging inputs. We will also examine change over time in tau, amyloid and cognition as outcomes. As any of these features considered singularly may be affected by age, and as amyloid and tau may be `necessary but not sufficient' by themselves, a derived multimodal marker may have eventual clinical utility in enriching prevention trials with those most likely to progress, and increasing power to detect change attributable to preclinical interventions. Significance: Relative tau and amyloid imaging profiles have not been empirically established in the presymptomatic time frame and this information is urgently needed to identify incipient disease.

An outgrowth of the project will be information about the rate of change in AD pathology which can help us plan clinical trials in this population using derived outcomes about the brain itself, thereby reducing the number of subjects needed in a trial and increasing sensitivity to detecting change.",The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD,9851062,R01AG021155,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Memory Loss', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention trial', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Secondary to', 'Semantic memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'amyloid pathology', 'amyloid structure', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'entorhinal cortex', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nerve injury', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,379779,0.2175878964403022
"Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease Abstract The exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes derived from brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by powerful computational tools has the potential of developing new knowledge, including the identification of pathways and targets that may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of the disease. The challenge is to find drugs that impact those pathways, and then validate the importance of those pathways – distinguishing primary disease drivers from secondary events. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to probe potential pathways in proof of concept, and ultimately therapeutic, clinical trials. Here, we propose to discover and validate hypotheses for drug repurposing in AD through three integrated, complementary informatics approaches. Specifically, we will apply classical and network aware (prior-loaded) machine learning approaches to identify pathways and targets altered in AD brains at different stages of disease progression using data from Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD available through Synapse (Aim 1); we will use systems pharmacology approaches to discover the target selectivity of lead compounds in human neuronal and glial cell types using unbiased RNA-seq, proteomic and imaging studies followed by pathway analysis (Aim 2). Each of these two Aims has two approaches: data-driven, hypothesis-generating analyses to discern disease-relevant drug signals; and hypothesis-testing in which positive findings from one approach are evaluated using the other approaches to assess rigor and reproducibility. Moreover, RNA-seq and proteomic data collected in cultured human CNS cell types following exposure to potential disease drivers and/or FDA-approved drugs in Aim 2 will be fed back into Aim 1 as CNS-cell type-derived priors to refine the predictive models. In Aim 3, we will develop new informatics strategies to conduct in-silico drug trials in EHR data with “prospective” outcomes to validate hypotheses based on the omics data sets and extant literature, using two big data sets: the UK 20 year CPRD longitudinal records of 20M National Health Service patients, and the RPDR Database (based at Partners Healthcare) with 6 M individuals followed for over 20 years. This integrated informatics program compensates for the limitations of each individual informatics approach to promote discovery and critical evaluation of “lead compounds” for known and novel AD pathways. To execute this strategy, we have assembled a multi-site, multi-disciplinary team with expertise ranging from clinical care to computer science and systems pharmacology. Some of the team members are AD experts and others bring an outsider's perspective. Finally, as a deliverable, we will create open-source data packages to release all the supporting evidence, software, and data with provenance in accordance with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) standards through Synapse and the AlzDataLens platform developed at MGH (Aim 4). These data packages will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies including collaborations with industry or members of the community at large involved in new clinical trials. Project Narrative Repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to accelerating proof-of-concept and ultimately therapeutic clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose a bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, using available expression data from AD brains in the public domain as our “laboratory” and electronic heath records(EHR) as our “clinical trial infrastructure”. Resulting data packages from these analyses will be shared on Open Science platforms and will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies, ultimately leading to new clinical trials.",Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease,9789798,R01AG058063,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lewy Bodies', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular Target', 'National Health Services', 'Network-based', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cheminformatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'disease registry', 'drug candidate', 'drug testing', 'gene discovery', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'open data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'protein expression', 'tau phosphorylation', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational study']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,768451,0.13941332041490703
"Functional Regression and Subgroup Analysis for Asynchronous Longitudinal Data. Project Summary / Abstract Asynchronous longitudinal designs have been widely used in studies on aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In these decades-long studies, as longitudinal variables were routinely collected from different platforms (e.g. food frequency questionnaires, lab results and clinical or psychological tests), the obtained data were not synchronized in time even for the same subject. As part of the motivating Normative Aging Study (NAS), it was of substantial interest to address whether dietary intake of niacin was associated with incident AD and cognitive decline. In the study, four cognitive tests were administered to participants in a span of 6 years after participation, and nutrient intake was determined by food frequency questionnaires distributed at the baseline and between adjacent cognitive tests. As a result, the exposure variables, including nutrient intake, and the outcomes of cognitive tests, were measured asynchronously. Naive analyses ignoring the mistiming issue will lead to biased results and wrong conclusion. In addition, the development of aging-associated diseases tends to differ in various (latent) subpopulations, where associations between disease progression and biomarkers and environmental exposures vary substantially across subpopulations. Subgroup analyses in aging populations are crucial for developing better strategies of preventing, treating and managing aging-associated diseases, such as AD.  Accounting for the peculiar nature of the NAS data, the proposed methods will help address the key question on the association between dietary intake of niacin and incident AD in the NAS. We will also examine other biomarkers and environmental exposures associated with AD. The proposed subgroup analysis will also help identify latent subgroups within the aging population and discern subgroup-specific risk factors leading to cognitive impairment. Unlike the existing work relying on restrictive model assumptions, the proposed methods are fully nonparametric, data adaptive and can be combined with state-of-the-art model selection methods to choose relevant risk factors for AD from hundreds of variables that might be time varying and asynchronous with the response. Methods and theory developed in this project will be widely applicable to other longitudinal studies. We will also develop new computation tools and software packages that are scalable for large longitudinal data sets with long followups.

"ALZ-Stage: Artificial intelligence driven technology with adaptive suite of personalized tests to detect and determine progressive stage of Alzheimers disease Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia to occur in elderly populations around the globe, currently affecting over 30 million people worldwide. As the U.S. elderly population continues to increase, the incidence of AD rises as well, as there is no known neuroprotective therapy or cure. The most common symptoms include memory loss, cognitive impairment, disorientation, and psychiatric issues. The initial diagnosis is achieved through a combination of clinical criteria including a neurological examination, mental status tests and brain imaging. However, these strategies are challenging for detection of early AD or patients with mild symptoms, specifically during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. Mental status tests and subjective journals, kept by patients or caregivers, are often used to track AD progression, but have low sensitivity and reliability for clinical trials. The most strongly established biomarkers for AD, including amyloid beta, tau protein, and phosphorylated tau, are all obtained thru CSF requiring invasive lumbar puncture.  ALZ-Stage technology will provide a convenient and accessible, yet comprehensive analytics suite to detect and stage Alzheimer's disease progression. The platform will integrate a progressive suite of diagnostic tests using a variety of biological, neurological, and behavioral platforms, subjective and objective inputs, and active and passive test components. The test battery may include blood sample, urine samples, wearable sensors, mobile phone sensors and behavioral tracking. The implementation strategy will progress from lower cost, more readily accessible and passive monitoring devices to more expensive, invasive and burdensome test as likelihood or ALZ stage increases. Unique patient demographics may impact sensitivity. For example, AD incidence in women is twice as high as men. Additionally, based on socio-economic or geographic disparities some populations may only have access to certain types of test equipment or supplies compared to others. Therefore, ALZ-Stage will use AI algorithms not only to detect and stage AD, but will also determine the specific test battery to use based on availability of test options and patient demographics.  The Phase I effort will target the highest risk project component which includes core algorithm development and verification. We will increase likelihood of project success by building on our existing framework that has shown strong feasibility for adaptively predicting test batteries to screen patients for Parkinson's disease. The work will be completed through strong collaboration with our expert technical team at Elder Research and our strong clinical consultants. More specifically, Phase I tasks will focus on developing an array of biomarker test suites for AD, collecting data from a wide range of AD subjects and controls with widely varying demographics, and using that data to build a two layer intelligent algorithm that can determine the most appropriate test battery for a subject and also accurately detect and stage AD during the MCI stage. The objective is to design, develop and demonstrate feasibility of ALZ-Stage, an artificial intelligence driven technology that utilizes an adaptive suite of personalized diagnostic tests to both detect and determine the progressive stage of MCI in Alzheimer's disease. While more than 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's, early and accurate diagnosis can significantly improve outcomes and could save up to $7.9 trillion in healthcare and long-term costs. Therefore, a low-cost, personalized, and widely accessible test suite to detect and stage AD progression would have a significant positive impact on healthcare outcomes and costs, as well as neuroprotective trials aimed at stopping or slowing disease progression.",ALZ-Stage: Artificial intelligence driven technology with adaptive suite of personalized tests to detect and determine progressive stage of Alzheimers disease,9846133,R43AG063581,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain imaging', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease Progression', 'Disorientation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Equipment', 'Geography', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Intelligence', 'Journals', 'Maps', 'Memory Loss', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'cognitive performance', 'common symptom', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'early screening', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved outcome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'men', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'monitoring device', 'patient screening', 'personalized diagnostics', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive test', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social media', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'wearable device']",NIA,"ELDER RESEARCH, INC.",R43,2019,224850,0.17730310484527256
"Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the complexity of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis and the associated co-morbid conditions, both the “depth” and the “width” of currently available drug repurposing solutions need to be improved in order to deliver effective AD therapeutic solutions. The depth of a drug-repurposing project refers to the level of understanding of disease mechanism and drug-target interactions across a wide searching space for the combination of dosage and treatment time. Achieving depth requires a reliable AD model system that comprehensively recapitulates AD pathogenesis in a human brain-like environment, and sophisticated transcriptomic profiles, which can reveal molecular-level changes underlying disease-reversing phenotypes across multiple treatment conditions. The width of a therapy search relies on the efficacy of predicting and validating effects of candidate compounds from an enormous search space. Width can be achieved from novel computational algorithms connecting –omics changes with phenotypic changes, thus guiding the search with improved knowledge on mechanisms and avoiding exhaustive testing of every available drug. Integrating the systems medicine and drug repositioning expertise of the Wong Lab at the Houston Methodist Research Institute of Houston Methodist Hospital with the Alzheimer's biology expertise of the Kim and Tanzi labs at Massachusetts General Hospital, we propose a SysteMatic Alzheimer's disease drug ReposiTioning (SMART) framework based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening. Reformatting a novel three- dimensional human neural stem cell culture model of AD (a.k.a. Alzheimer's in a dish) developed in the Kim and Tanzi labs for high content screening, the Wong lab screened 2,640 known drugs and bioactive compounds and obtained a panel of 38 primary hits that strongly inhibit β-amyloid-driven p-tau accumulation. We hypothesize that iteratively running relatively small screens with our novel 3D cell model and applying systematic artificial intelligence modeling to the transcriptomic profiles of the screening hits will allow us to: 1) quickly obtain a panel of robust novel drug candidates for AD, and 2) gain an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms from those repositioned drug candidates, which will subsequently improve the success rate of predicting novel hits. Using the primary 38 hits as a starting point, the SMART computational modules will update the existing NeuriteIQ software package to quantify the image data from high content screening; it will also incorporate publicly available big data transcriptomic profiles to predict candidate compounds inducing similar pathway changes as those original compounds, effectively expanding the search width to tens of thousands of compounds while only requiring functional validation of less than 100 drug candidates. The validated predictions will, in turn, add to the panel of known hits that will launch the next round of computational predictions and experimental validations, efficiently generating candidates for novel AD therapies (Aim 1). SMART's iterative prediction-validation scheme effectively connects more transcriptomic profiles to desirable phenotypic changes. Thus, we will apply systematic image-omics modeling to uncover novel mechanisms driving such phenotypes. For all the validated hits, dose-responses for the phenotype of pTau inhibition will be obtained using the 3D culture model; while the dose-responses for individual genes and pathways will be modeled through public and in-house generated transcriptomic profiles. We will use Partial Least Square Regression models to identify gene modules with matching dose-response curves as the phenotypes, thus allowing us to go beyond the confinement of canonical pathway maps and identify novel functional modules specifically related to phenotypes of interest (Aim 2). Selected compounds derived from the previous two aims will be evaluated in human neurons directly derived from AD patients and in animal models (Aim 3). Success of this work will lead to new AD therapeutic compounds ready for translation into clinical trials, as well as a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the SMART framework for drug repositioning will be generalizable to other big data and disease platforms. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) currently afflicts 5.3 million people in the United States alone. Beyond symptomatic treatments, no clear therapeutic options are available. The proposed study provides a systematic drug repositioning strategy that uses a novel 3D human neural culture model (Alzheimer's-in-a-dish) integrated with a computational platform that leverages publicly available toxicology and pharmokinetic big data. Success of the study will greatly reduce the cost of AD drug development, identify potential new disease mechanism, and facilitate quicker translation from bench to bedside. .",Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics,9781632,R01AG057635,"['3-Dimensional', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Methodist Church', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Institute', 'Running', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Width', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'exhaustion', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'individual response', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symptom treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tau-1', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,689643,0.13085335160728429
"Robust Inference from Observational Data with Distributed Representations of Conceptual Relations Abstract This proposal concerns the development and evaluation of computational methods through which linguistic manifestations of cognitive changes in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) dementia can be identified in transcribed speech. Such methods are of value even prior to the availability of disease modifying treatments, as through earlier detection they provide the means to reduce the emotional and financial burden on patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system. Lack of a clear diagnosis in the face of cognitive manifestations of dementia can produce uncertainty, and negatively impact planning of future care. Misattributed AD symptoms can lead to social isolation. In addition, it is estimated that early and accurate diagnosis can help save an estimated $7.9 trillion in medical and care costs. With ~30-40% of healthy adults subjectively reporting forgetfulness on a regular basis, there is an urgent need to develop sensitive and specific, easy-to-use, safe, and cost-effective tools for monitoring AD-specific cognitive markers in individuals concerned about their cognitive function. Language reflects cognitive status, but manual analysis of language data is prohibitively time-consuming. In the proposed research we will develop and evaluate computational methods to identify linguistic biomarkers of AD, leveraging perplexity estimates derived from neural language models trained on transcripts of the speech of healthy controls only. This approach deviates from the supervised learning paradigm that characterizes most computational linguistics approaches to identifying AD, obviating the danger of overfitting to the characteristics of participants with dementia represented in the small datasets available for training. Nonetheless, our preliminary research has demonstrated that classification performance on the basis of such perplexity estimates rivals that documented with supervised machine learning models trained on hundreds of manually engineered features. The proposed research will result in a validated set of methods for detection of AD using transcribed speech, methods with the potential for broad dissemination on account of recent advances in automated speech recognition. Project Narrative The need to monitor unintended effects of medications has been highlighted by several high-profile events in which fatal side effects of approved drugs were detected after their release to market. In the proposed research, we will develop and evaluate methods to identify biologically plausible adverse drug events using both observational data and knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature. If successful, these methods will provide the means for earlier detection of harmful drug effects, limiting consequent morbidity and mortality.",Robust Inference from Observational Data with Distributed Representations of Conceptual Relations,9881862,R01LM011563,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Theft', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'care costs', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'disease diagnosis', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural model', 'outcome forecast', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'side effect', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,400387,0.0762716452397228
"Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Over the last decade, scientists have accelerated their efforts to understand Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This has led to unprecedented knowledge of the genetic and biological bases of AD risk, and vast stores of valuable data for further mining. Understanding the genetic and biological risk states for AD is, in itself, extraordinarily valuable for guiding mechanistic studies, developing better diagnostics, and formulating therapeutics. But an understanding of risk states also has the benefit of allowing research on resilience to AD. Research on the genetic and biological bases of resilience necessarily lags behind the discovery of risk factors. Now, as the risk architecture of AD is coming into view, it is feasible to study resilience to AD in individuals who are cognitively normal despite being at elevated risk for the disease. The approach we have devised for identifying resilience factors is straightforward yet, to our knowledge, unprecedented. We identify unaffected individuals at the highest levels of multivariate risk, match them to affected individuals at equivalent levels of risk, and contrast these two subgroups to find residual variation associated with the absence of disease. In this project, we will capitalize on the wealth of existing high-throughput AD risk-factor results and data, and our involvement in many of the world’s largest AD consortia, to efficiently map resilience to AD at three levels (genetics, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging), and to integrate across these levels. In Aim 1, we will identify genetic variation associated with resilience to AD in the presence of elevated genetic risk conferred by APOE ε4 alleles, an elevated AD polygenic risk score, or an elevated AD polygenic hazard score. In Aim 2, we will mega-analyze all available transcriptomic data from studies of postmortem hippocampal tissue and of peripheral blood in AD to identify transcriptomic risk scores and machine-learning algorithms that maximally distinguish AD from cognitively normal control subjects, and scores and algorithms that then identify residual transcriptomic variation that offsets the transcriptomic risk in resilient controls. In Aim 3, we will identify an MRI-based structural brain signature that is associated with resilience to AD in the presence of an AD- associated cortical risk signature. Lastly, in our exploratory Aim 4, we will integrate genetic, transcriptomic, brain structural, and clinical data to identify biological relationships across Aims, and novel phenotypes of resilience. Collectively, these Aims will identify multivariate, genetic, transcriptomic, and brain-structural profiles of resilience to AD, as well as molecular, neurobiological, and clinical phenotypes stemming from AD- resilience genotypes. Project Narrative Not all people at high risk for Alzheimer's disease develop the disorder. This project aims to identify genes, molecules, and brain structures that protect some people from their otherwise-elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Finding the biological basis for resilience to Alzheimer's disease may shed light on better options for diagnosing, treating, and even preventing the illness, in ways that can't be found by only studying people who already have the disease.","Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease",9839179,R01AG064955,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'phenome', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,790352,0.26724490604967216
"Fast multiparametric MR imaging as early biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Without a cure or prevention, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) rapidly will become an overwhelming economic and social burden. With the failure of multiple clinical trials targeting reduction of beta-amyloid (Aβ) burden and in general the stagnation of the development of effective treatment for AD, AD community believes that underlying causes of AD must be attacked before emergence of the cognitive phenotype. In this context, the development of predictive biomarkers and models is critical for identifying patients with high risk of rapid progression along the AD continuum, i.e. transitioning from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to dementia. Previous AD research has primarily been utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing morphological changes. Our preliminary results and other studies have shown that quantitative MR parameters such T1, T2, the magnetic susceptibility values are sensitive to normal ageing process and AD. However, their wide spread in AD research protocols has been limited due to scan time constraints. The overarching goal of the proposal is to establish a fast MR technique that does not increase overall scan time of a conventional MR protocol; and in addition to providing all the information the conventional protocol provides, it will also provide multiple quantitative parametric measurements specifically targeted to the needs of AD diagnosis and prognosis. We will 1) develop a fast and motion-insensitive MR technique (M3FAST-ECHO) that can generate multiple quantitative parameters within 10 minutes; 2) validate the volumetric measurement and microhemorrhage assessment from the synthetic 3D T1-weighted and the susceptibility weighted imaging from M3FAST-ECHO against standard ADNI protocol in 30 patients with mild cognitive impairment and 30 aged matched cognitively normal subjects; 3) compare quantitative T1, T2* and quantitative susceptibility values in 30 MCI patients and 30 aged matched cognitively normal subjects, and to correlate these metrics with neuropsychological measurements in the participants. The successful completion of the aims will result in a fast MR technique that provides multiple parametric MR maps without increasing overall scan time, and provide preliminary results for establishing values of quantitative MR parametric maps as sensitive biomarkers of AD. This will greatly enhance our ability to evaluate and screen for early predictive biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease. The inter-disciplinary team and infrastructure for AD research at Emory will ensure successful execution of the study and dissemination of the developed techniques to the entire AD research community.

"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET- positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points – baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD all measures; controls – clinical and cognitive measures only) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression.

"MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a leading cause of disability and death in the US and major global public health problem due to rise in aging population resulting in untold suffering, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies is certain. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Our application is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing to leverage an innovative molecular imaging platform invented at Stanford, multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI). We will determine the high dimensional cellular and subcellular protein-level expression, interaction, and localization for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomic and proteomic studies in resilience and pathologic states using human brain sections from an ongoing proteomic investigation of AD. We hypothesize that in-depth, stage-specific phenotypic signatures extracted from these unique groups will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. We will test our hypothesis through three Specific Aims: (1) Establish a subcellular, phenotypic framework of vulnerable and resistant brain areas. Next-generation MIBI equipment will be used to rigorously image 30+ proteins simultaneously; targets marking subtypes of neurons, synapses, non-neuronal cells, neuro-inflammatory, and vascular components will be concurrently measured. (2) Reveal cognitive resilience multiplexed phenotypes. Using approaches we have successfully applied in other single cell studies, we will analyze multiplexed imaging data with statistical deep learning methods already established in our lab to identify topological, cellular, and molecular phenotypic differences among resilient, co- morbid, and AD dementia. (3) Implement a shared data repository. The power of multiplexed imaging in biology is its ability to reveal co-localization or mutual exclusivity to infer regulatory roles and gain mechanistic insight. To disseminate hundreds of these images from our proposed highly multiplexed study, we will create a web-based portal, using already established infrastructure, where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi-color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features will be shared freely. PROJECT NARRATIVE AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the aging American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. Such signatures will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. Such insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets, as well as create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD.",MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease,9756278,R01AG057915,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Electrons', 'Equipment', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lobule', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'abeta accumulation', 'aging population', 'collaborative approach', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'disease-causing mutation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'multiplexed\xa0imaging', 'nanometer resolution', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'presenilin', 'presenilin-1', 'presenilin-2', 'resilience', 'response to injury', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tissue resource', 'vascular factor']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,893296,0.18604110527696535
"TMS in preclinical and prodromal AD: Modulation of brain networks and memory Project Summary  In the prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), beta-amyloid (AB) and tau preferentially spread throughout the default mode network (DMN) leading to neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction. Episodic memory impairments in AD are thought to arise from the loss of structural and functional connectivity between nodes of the DMN. Emerging evidence from studies with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in young adults demonstrate that the DMN can be modulated in a manner that promotes lasting episodic memory improvement. However, several fundamental questions remain regarding the factors that govern whether rTMS is effective in patients with Alzheimer's pathology and neurodegeneration.  The primary goal of this proposal is to refine our understanding of the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of rTMS for enhancing DMN integrity and episodic memory in individuals with Alzheimer's pathology. 30 patients with prodromal AD, 30 AB+ cognitively normal older adults, and 30 AB- cognitively normal older adults will each undergo 5 days of sham-controlled rTMS preceded and followed by multimodal MRI sessions and cognitive testing. rTMS targets will be established using baseline functional connectivity derived from resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) to determine the region in lateral parietal cortex with maximal functional connectivity to the hippocampus. rsfMRI outcome measures will include functional connectivity between the stimulation site and hippocampus, and intrinsic activity within the stimulation site and hippocampus. AB, tau, and FDG positron emission tomography (PET) scans and structural MRI will be used to quantify the impact of Alzheimer's pathology, hypometabolism, and atrophy on the efficacy of rTMS treatments in each group. All outcome measures will be related to behavioral measures of episodic memory immediately and 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Aim 1 of the proposed project will establish the effects of rTMS on episodic memory in each group. Aim 2 will establish functional network effects of rTMS in each group. Aim 3 will use multivariate regression and machine learning algorithms to identify the biological features that are most useful in predicting whether an individual will benefit from rTMS.  All data collection and analyses will take place at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. During the completion of the project the candidate will receive training in the theory and application of TMS to modulate network function, the use of PET imaging to measure pathology in AD, clinical trial design, and the use of advanced biostatistics for biomarker development and treatment response prediction. The outcome of this research will provide insight into the individuals that are most likely to benefit from rTMS, and will inform future studies seeking to optimize rTMS treatments to improve cognition in dementia. Furthermore, the completion of this project will lay the foundation for the candidate's long-term goal of translating basic neuroimaging findings from healthy aging to direct benefits for patients with Alzheimer's disease. The proposed research examines the potential benefits of non-invasive repetitive transcranial brain stimulation (rTMS) to behavior and memory neurocircuitry in older adults and patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. The outcome of this research will provide critical insight into the individuals that are most likely to benefit from rTMS, and to inform future studies seeking to optimize rTMS treatments to improve cognition in dementia.

"CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder. Inflammatory changes in the brain are thought to represent key processes in the onset and progression of AD, but it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation confers neuroprotection, accelerated degeneration, or possibly both. Such an understanding in living humans is critical if we are to begin clinical trials using the array of FDA-approved immunomodulatory drugs in the future. We propose that complement- mediated neuroinflammation is protective in the early AD stages, while suppression of complement activities is accompanied by the development of greater cognitive deficits and faster cognitive decline. Our preliminary data from multiple cohorts support this hypothesis by showing 1) reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement-related markers occur in the dementia stage but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD; 2) reduced CSF complement-related markers and elevated CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with faster decline in AD; and 3) CSF inflammatory protein alterations reveal networks of cellular and protein regulations. In the In the current application, we will build on the association between complement related proteins and rates of cognitive decline in AD to identify associated changes in soluble CSF cytokines and chemokines, differential inflammatory cell type regulation, and imaging correlates of neuroinflammation. This application takes advantage of our group’s strengths in performing CSF cytokine measurements, CSF immunophenotyping, molecular imaging of neuroinflammation through positron emission tomography (PET) and iron-enhanced MRI, and network analysis through a novel biochemical-bioinformatics pipeline. We will directly identify individual and networks of soluble CSF cytokines that accompany the transition from the MCI to the dementia stage of AD, correlate the complement and other altered pathways with microglial activation through two modern PET tracers (11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA), and measure changes in individual T helper cell (type 1, 2, 17) and non-T cell populations. This application represents the first attempt to correlate, at the individual level and at the group level, CSF and imaging measures of neuroinflammation. If successful, this application will advance the understanding of neuroinflammation in AD through parallel approaches, form the basis of a new biomarker panel (and algorithm) to diagnose AD through a combination of degenerative and inflammatory markers, and accelerate the target identification of future therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system in AD. Brain inflammation is a key event in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but it is not clear whether it is harmful, protective, or both. The current proposal aims to confirm our finding that a switch from the protective to harmful type of inflammation predicts more severe symptoms and faster progression in Alzheimer’s disease, and we can identify people with the protective and harmful inflammation by studying the cerebrospinal fluid (circulating proteins and cells) and brain imaging (PET and MRI scans).","CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease",9695140,R01AG054046,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement Suppression', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Encephalitis', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fractalkine', 'Future', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging ligands', 'Immune system', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-7', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Phagocytes', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'biomarker panel', 'brain dysfunction', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'demographics', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'iron oxide', 'macrophage', 'migration', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'neuroprotection', 'novel']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,728951,0.20402257234873727
"Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome Project ABSTRACT – Overall Behavioral, emotional and cognitive disorders have been historically studied as diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). However, emerging data suggests a gut-brain connection in a variety of diseases that affect the brain. Our own data and others’ suggests a gut-brain connection in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the leading cause of dementia. There are currently no therapies to prevent or slow AD progression, causing a huge socioeconomic burden and highlighting our incomplete knowledge. Given an emerging role for gut microbiome and hypotheses implicating viral and bacterial contributions to AD pathogenesis, defining the bidirectional biochemical communication between the brain and the gut will improve understanding of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Indeed, it is crucial to study the brain not in isolation, but in the context of peripheral influences including diet, lifestyle, and microbiome. In this proposal we build on large initiatives and infrastructures co-established by our multi-disciplinary team including: The American Gut Project, The AD Metabolomics Consortium, Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD), The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) and centers of excellence in informatics and systems biology. We aim to define the role of gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis and biochemical axis of communication between gut and brain. Aim 1: Examine the association between the gut microbiome and AD phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the biochemical axis of communication between the gut microbiome and the brain and identify metabolites that contribute to AD endophenotypes. Aim 3: Examine mechanistic links between the activity of the gut microbiome and AD pathogenesis, and identify new approaches for AD prevention that target the gut-brain axis. These aims will be enabled three projects supported by an Omics and Technology Core, a Computational and Systems Biology Core, and an Administrative Core that provides data and biorepository infrastructure. Project 1 will define changes in gut microbiome and metabolome across the AD trajectory; Project 2 leverages three existing clinical trials of controlled diets to examine dietary effects on gut microbiome, metabolome, cognition and brain imaging; Project 3 examines mechanism by defining gut- brain communication and microbiome-based interventions in animal models of AD. In this U19 we will create an unprecedented, high-quality dataset and resources specifically for the AD research community, and make these available under open science, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data principles. With our cross-disciplinary team of experts in clinical AD, gut microbiome research, imaging, metabolomics, informatics, deep learning and systems biology, this effort will yield novel biomarkers for AD progression and prognosis, and insight into mechanisms opening the door to development of transformative options for AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE – Overall Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurological disease in the US and evidence suggests that genetics, gut bacteria, diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposures contribute to human metabolism and its dysregulation in diseases including AD. Gut-brain biochemical axis are being identified and seem implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders like AD. Understanding how different diets can prevent or reverse AD, and targets that could be delivered microbioiologically or pharmacologically to persons who cannot or will not change their diet, is an important long-term goal in AD research, especially given the emerging understanding that responses to diet are highly individualized and dependent on the microbiome. The goal of the current project is to define the gut-brain-chemical axis of communication of the role of the gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis.",Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome Project,9794999,U19AG063744,"['3xTg-AD mouse', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amines', 'Animal Model', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Emotional disorder', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'FAIR principles', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Manipulative Therapies', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Microbe', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Translations', 'Viral', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Work', 'Xenobiotics', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cytotoxic', 'deep learning', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'fecal metabolome', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'outcome forecast', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'symposium']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,U19,2019,5690172,0.22550145719955328
"Effects of Biomedical Risk Factors on Neuro-cognition Using MRI: Long term follow-up of the Diabetes Control & Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study Cohort Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality, and are expected to pose an increasing burden because the US population is aging. Technological advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and analytic algorithms facilitate increasingly precise measurement and characterization of structural and functional brain changes that may be early indicators of pathologic processes leading to AD/ADRD. Early detection of these changes is critical during preclinical stages before the pathologic change has advanced to an irreversible state, as this is a period when treatment may be most effective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) appears to accelerate the trajectory of brain aging. As Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients live longer, they might be at increased risk for AD/ADRD but little is known about the impact of T1DM on accelerated brain aging and ADRD. We are responding to NOT-AG-18-039 to seek an administrative supplement to DP3114812 -(Effects of Biomedical Risk Factors on Neuro-cognition Using MRI) to leverage the long term follow-up of the Diabetes Control & Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study (EDIC) Cohort to investigate associations with AD-related changes on brain MRI. The participants have been studied for over 35 years, with detailed longitudinal biomedical and cognitive data gathered from baseline and are entering the age of increased risk for AD/ADRD. Our project addresses action item 1.C.1 of the National Alzheimer's Project Act 2018 update: identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression. Enhanced neuroimaging methods for early diagnosis can serve as foundations for designing and following subjects in clinical trials and selecting patients at greatest risk for therapeutic interventions. The primary goal of this supplement is to evaluate the presence of AD-like patterns of brain atrophy in the DCCT/EDIC population. We plan to construct robust imaging markers of clinical and preclinical AD, as well as to systematically characterize the heterogeneity of brain aging and its associations with various risk factors by leveraging multiple advances since the original proposal including a large NIA-funded study led by our group that pools together data from approximately 20,000 individuals, called iSTAGING. These new advances will permit us to develop a new focus on ADRD, addressing our Specific Aims: 1) Harmonize the EDIC MRI datasets with a large brain aging and AD consortium (iSTAGING), using state of the art statistical imaging analytics methods, as well as an enriched set of healthy control individuals scanned in the same sites and by the same protocol. 2) Evaluate the presence of patterns of brain atrophy that have been established in MCI and AD, and to relate those patterns to biomedical predictors and cognitive decline in EDIC. This plan builds upon the currently funded project to now include explicit ADRD research objectives. Our study will help determine whether T1DM is associated with pre-clinical brain imaging patterns of AD. The effects of type 1 diabetes on brain structure and thinking processes are poorly understood and understudied especially among the growing population of older patients who are at greatest risk for these problems. The Diabetes Control & Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions & Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study affords an unparalleled opportunity to use blood sugar control and other information gathered over a 30 year period from early in the course of illness, among this well-characterized group of patients, to examine important and unresolved questions about the frequency and causes of these problems using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and cognitive testing. By achieving these aims we will determine key predictors of neuro-cognitive impairments and guide strategies to mitigate this risk, and address a topic of considerable concern, for which little definitive information is available to clinicians and patients, particularly those with long-standing type 1 diabetes who are over 50 years of age.",Effects of Biomedical Risk Factors on Neuro-cognition Using MRI: Long term follow-up of the Diabetes Control & Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study Cohort,9879993,DP3DK114812,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognition', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Study of magnetics', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'aging brain', 'analytical method', 'automated image analysis', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes control', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'learning strategy', 'macrovascular disease', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'pre-clinical', 'premature', 'recruit', 'response', 'study population']",NIDDK,NYU WINTHROP HOSPITAL,DP3,2019,401596,0.12207871026090839
"A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials PROJECT SUMMARY It is our hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous conditions and, therefore, a paradigm shift is required to identify specific subpopulations for targeted interventions. This approach has generated significant success in other complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. A key opportunity in this context is the identification of those most likely to benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs and other anti-inflammatory compounds. The relation between inflammation and the development of AD, MCI, and cognitive decline has received a great deal of attention with basic science and observational human studies demonstrating a protective effect against cognitive loss. Likewise, in our work, inflammation has been a key mechanism in the biological profile that is indicative of disease presence. Based on a wealth of literature (epidemiological, cross-sectional, pathobiological and animal model), multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the utility of NSAID compounds in treating or preventing AD (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study [ADCS] AD and MCI anti-inflammatory trials; Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial [ADAPT]); however, each of these studies failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit, in fact some patients may have exhibited worsening cognitive performance with treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that particular subsets of patients in these trials did benefit from treatment and that our blood-based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify both positive and adverse responders within these trials. Here we propose to leverage three previously conducted clinical trials to test our hypothesis that our blood- based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify the subsets of patients who benefited from these previously conducted clinical trials. By conducting proteomic assays from existing biorepositories from the ADCS and ADAPT, we will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate the utility of the proinflammatory endophenotype as a means for patient selection into NSAID therapy for treating and preventing AD; Specific Aim 2. To determine if change in proinflammatory endophenotype scores over time is a biomarker of therapeutic response. By leveraging a highly innovative method and substantial existing resources, the current project addresses a significant need in the search for novel approaches AD therapeutics. The significance of the current project is the identification of a specific subset of patients who will experience clinically significant cognitive benefit from administration of NSAID medication. If successful, the current project will set the stage for a novel clinical trial that enrolls patients specifically based on baseline proinflammatory endophenotype scores for administration of NSAID therapy. In the long-term, this line of research is designed to build a person-centered (i.e. personalized) approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's diseases are a growing public health crisis impacting millions of elders world-wide with a health care cost greater than cancer and equivalent to cardiovascular disease. Current treatments only slow progression of the disease and new strategies are urgently needed. The relevance of the current project is the validation of a person-centered approach to treating Alzheimer's disease by identifying specific subgroups that are most likely to respond to targeted therapies. The outcomes of this project will fundamentally change the approach to the search for novel therapies for AD from the “one-size-fits-all” approach to the search for specific subgroups that can be treated with targeted medications.",A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials,9686501,R01AG051848,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'IL18 gene', 'IL5 gene', 'IL6 gene', 'IL7 gene', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-10', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Naproxen', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Prevention trial', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'arm', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive benefits', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'response', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R01,2019,813603,0.1681821278576562
"Personalized Combination Therapy for AD with Common Comorbidities Project summary Our goal is to develop artificial intelligent (AI) analytics models to facilitate personalized treatment plans for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients with most common comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM) and depression. AD is a neurodegenerative disease that progressively causes memory loss and cognitive impairment. While current treatments have shown some amelioration of symptoms, the effects have been transient and limited to a small percentage of patients. Moreover, disease-modifying drugs based on our current understanding of disease mechanisms have all shown negative results in clinical trials. Part of the failure is due to the heterogeneity in the disease mechanism, of which we do not yet have a clear understanding. Additionally, increasing evidence has indicated that comorbidities of AD share common disease pathways with AD, and medications used for these diseases may also alter the cognitive functions in AD patients. However, few studies have assessed combinations of these medications in treatments for AD. In this study, we will address this problem by retrospectively analyzing the observational data collected by the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). In Aim 1, we plan to statistically investigate the effects of different medications when used in combination with anti-AD medications on the trajectory of cognitive decline. If specific drug combination(s) are found to have a potential synergistic effect against cognitive decline, we will further study the underlying mechanisms using molecular systems pharmacology methods in Aim 2. In Aim 3, we will focus on establishing a clinical decision support system that facilitates individualized treatment for AD patients with these common comorbidities. We will build a Bayesian Network model that can predict the disease progression based patient and treatment information provided by the ADRC data set. The model will be learned and tested based on the ADRC dataset using the Tetrad software package. We will then apply methodologies of decision theory and search for a treatment combination that leads to the optimal treatment outcomes for specific patients. Collectively, these studies will contribute to a discovery of novel drug combinations for treating AD patients with comorbidities, and generate ideas for a clinical decision support system that can facilitate personalized medicine for these patients. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and depression are most prevalent coexisting medical conditions in AD patients. Researchers from University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy and School of Medicine plan to analyze the medication history of AD patients to find better treatments for AD patients with those comorbidities and to study the molecular mechanisms with advanced computational approaches. Ultimately, the studies will contribute to discover effective combination therapies for AD patients.",Personalized Combination Therapy for AD with Common Comorbidities,9992313,R56AG062493,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Combination Medication', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Theory', 'Dementia', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Expert Systems', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Memantine', 'Memory Loss', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacy Schools', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive benefits', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbid depression', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'driving force', 'drug discovery', 'genetic signature', 'individualized medicine', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'mental state', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel therapeutics', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2019,377443,0.2561196515467656
"Understanding the dynamic interactions between tau pathology and microglia-mediated inflammation in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract The etiology, mechanism and progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and the relationship of AD pathology to clinical manifestations, are not fully understood. Emerging studies suggest that inflammation and microglial activation is an important contributor to AD pathogenesis and progression. The association between tau and microglia is especially critical, since tau is most closely associated with AD. The conventionally accepted sequence of this interaction is that misfolded tau, which is pro-inflammatory, causes microglial activation, leading to dendritic pruning and eventually neuronal cell death. However, it is recently emerging that microglial activation can itself cause tau aggregation and subsequent propagation. Therefore the causality of these interactions is controversial, and requires much needed elucidation in humans in vivo. The goal of this proposal is to understand the interaction and causal sequencing between tau, neurodegeneration, microglia and systemic inflammation in governing the etiology and progression of human AD. This proposal involves a series of principled statistical and mathematical model-based tests that will uncover these relationships, for the first time, directly in patients. This proposal involves a new prospective longitudinal study of 80 AD spectrum patients acquiring brain MRI and PET imaging of activated microglia using a new generation TSPO ligand called DPA-713 and tau-PET imaging using a relatively novel ligand, MK6240. The same imaging protocol (MRI, DPA-713 and MK6240 PET) will be repeated in a 2-year follow up visit. Next this proposal involves developing and testing a model of microglial inflammation-tau interaction via mathematical models to determine whether regional microglia-mediated neuroinflammation measured by DPA-PET is higher in AD- spectrum patients or in cognitively normal older adults; and whether regional microglial activation is predictable directly from tau. Finally, this proposed research includes testing a network spread model of tau and microglia. Mounting animal data implicate a trans-neuronal transmission mechanism of tau through brain networks. Using a network diffusion model of disease spread, this proposal will further investigate the role of microglia in tau progression directly in humans. Since tau and microglia provide complementary signal about evolving pathology, this proposal will determine whether combining imaging studies that measure both biomarkers will result in a uniquely powerful and predictive test of AD progression. Given the rapidly evolving understanding of the role of microglia and systemic inflammation in dementias, the current proposal is timely, topical and necessary for advancing human dementia research. If successful, it will give the first validated spatiotemporal model of the causal interactions between pathology and neuroinflammation in AD, catalyzing future advances in prognostication and targeted anti-inflammatory therapies. Project Narrative Alzheimer's Disease (AD) poses an increasingly large public health burden. By providing new insights into the role of neuroinflammation in AD, this study will provide the foundation for future advances in prognostication and targeted anti-inflammatory therapies for this devastating disease.",Understanding the dynamic interactions between tau pathology and microglia-mediated inflammation in Alzheimer's Disease,9960742,R56AG064873,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Atrophic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'TREM2 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'animal data', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'model design', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prognostic', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tau interaction', 'tau mutation', 'tractography', 'transmission process']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R56,2019,770628,0.16158249553376539
"Algebraic Formulations for Characterizing Structural Brain Connectivity Changes and Pathology Transmission Networks in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY: Accumulating evidence suggests that measuring loss of structural connectivity together with markers of core Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles may facilitate identification of individuals with the greatest risk of progressing to dementia. The primary focus and overarching goal of this project is to improve prediction of cognitive decline in the preclinical stage, prior to irreversible disease stages by utilizing novel wavelets based multi-scale brain connectivity signatures (WaCS) and deriving mechanisms that characterize the propagation of plaque and tangle pathology in the brain over time. We will accomplish this goal by using longitudinal cognitive and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data acquired from asymptomatic middle-aged participants enrolled in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention study and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center clinical core. The analyses will be driven by (a) the “Wavelets on graphs” transforms which allow us to simultaneously operate on multiple scale representations of brain connectivity and yield very sensitive detection of weak but real disease-specific signals with rigorous statistical confidence and (b) novel algebraic formulations that parameterize the dynamics of molecular pathology progression at the subject-specific level using an exquisite spatial mapping of amyloid and tau pathology with PiB and MK6240 PET. The proposed project comprises of three aims. Specific Aim 1: Derive structural connectivity phenotypes of preclinical AD by extending wavelet based multi-scale representations of brain connectivity graphs with improved microstructural specificity offered by biophysical diffusion models beyond classical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We will utilize  𝛽𝛽 these representations to identify statistical associations between connectivity, cerebrospinal fluid based AD biomarkers (e.g., A 42, phosphorylated tau), and cognitive trajectories. Specific Aim 2: Develop techniques to characterize the subject-specific propagation dynamics of amyloid and tau pathology as measured on PET images and evaluate their associations with structural connectivity, total pathology burden and cognitive scores. Specific Aim 3: Design frameworks for predicting cognitive trajectories at the individual level using structural connectivity and molecular pathology propagation networks. Significance: This project is expected to transform three distinct areas of AD research, it will (1) deliver the impact of multi-resolution analysis of brain connectivity networks derived from diffusion models beyond the classical DTI for preclinical AD, (2) characterize how amyloid plaque and tangle pathology propagate over time in a subject-specific manner in early AD stages and (3) how such information sources can be utilized to jointly predict endpoint diagnostic status at the level of individual subjects, for monitoring disease progression and as a first step towards criteria that could inform the design of secondary prevention trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project will deploy novel algebraic methods for image analysis to characterize (i) changes in brain connectivity and (ii) dynamics of molecular pathology propagation in healthy asymptomatic individuals who are at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also have evidence of AD related pathology but are at a preclinical stage. The analysis will identify specific structural connections in the brain affected by highly specific tau and amyloid AD pathology: this will yield accurate mathematical models which use connectivity and longitudinal propagation of pathology markers for predicting clinical outcome measures such as longitudinal cognitive decline in cognitively healthy individuals. The joint connectivity/pathology AD biomarkers have applications in understanding the early AD processes in cognitively healthy at-risk individuals that could eventually inform the design of clinical trials and hypotheses driven studies focused on preclinical AD.",Algebraic Formulations for Characterizing Structural Brain Connectivity Changes and Pathology Transmission Networks in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease,9661823,RF1AG059312,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algebra', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Linear Algebra', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'diffusion weighted', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'middle age', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular pathology', 'neurogranin', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'serial imaging', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'transmission process', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,RF1,2019,1826486,0.15675932741911158
"Leveraging the Human Non-Coding Transcriptome to Identify Therapeutics for Healthy Aging and Alzheimers Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Age is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Nevertheless, a majority of individuals do not develop AD by their 9th decade of life. We propose that targeting the endogenous protective mechanisms associated with ‘healthy aging’ represents a sound scientific paradigm for addressing AD prevention, especially if this can be achieved using a combination of pre-existing FDA approved drugs. Our initial models of human aging identified novel transcriptomic signatures of aging, common in human hippocampus and muscle, prompting us to develop an expanded biobank and an updated assay that integrates both protein coding and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) data using novel RNA quantification methods, and extensively phenotyped clinical resources. We have utilized this translational bioinformatics strategy and a novel human biobank to produce a robust prototype screen that successfully identified >100 drugs from in silico analysis using the NIH cMAP/LINCS database, including 29 chemical regulators of a proven longevity pathway (PI3K/mTOR, p<0.00001). We validated this activity in human primary cells. Here, our overarching goal is to refine this screen in a range of human cell models and identify optimal combinations of FDA approved drugs that positively regulate the healthy-aging-related RNA network without the focused need for direct PI3K/mTOR inhibition and hence reduced potential side effects. Through the pursuit of 3 major distinct but interacting aims, the present body of work will enhance the network modeling by incorporating human brain aging lncRNA responses; formatting the current validated assay into a higher-throughput screen able to examine ~5,000-10,000 combinations of individually active drugs. We expect to demonstrate that our strategy can guide repositioning of individual drugs into sets of drug-combinations that ‘switch on’ a healthy-aging profile in human cell systems. NARRATIVE The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is age, and up to 10% of the population develops AD by the age of 65. Since over 1.2 billion people are set to reach 65yr world-wide in the coming two decades, the imminent socioeconomic costs mean that it is extremely urgent to identify practical solutions. We have discovered a healthy-aging molecular signature that is ‘druggable’; and have devised a high-throughput strategy to identify combinations of efficacious FDA-approved drugs that induce that signature. Unlike standard drug-development that is too slow, the present project aims to quickly select ideal drug combinations that might delay or prevent AD and motivate new clinical trials.",Leveraging the Human Non-Coding Transcriptome to Identify Therapeutics for Healthy Aging and Alzheimers Disease,9787113,R56AG061911,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aerobic', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Europe', 'Exons', 'FDA approved', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longevity Pathway', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Titrations', 'Transcript', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'drug standard', 'epigenomics', 'healthy aging', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human model', 'mTOR inhibition', 'mitochondrial autophagy', 'molecular modeling', 'network models', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'resilience', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'tau phosphorylation', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R56,2019,728812,0.07336656562774008
"Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a prospective, community-based 3-generational study that enrolled participants between ages 20-50 and has examined them every 2-4 years to collect extensive lifestyle, vascular, biomarker data; 9300 have GWAS. Embedded in this cohort are 1036 multigenerational families. Surveillance for AD dementia (and MCI) has been ongoing for over 4 decades. We have identified 1421 incident AD, 1767 MCI, enrolled 800+ in a brain donation program, obtained 7000+ 1.5T brain MRI, and repeated, detailed neuropsychological assessments. We have recently obtained extensive omics in ~6000 (gene expression, methylation, miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics) and genomics (50X whole genome sequences [WGS] in 4197 with pedigree-based imputation to 6554) through the NHLBI funded SABRe CVD (omics) and TOPMed (WGS) programs. We seek to leverage these rich resources (>$25 million). We propose these specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain temporal trends in clinical AD dementia in the FHS cohorts. The age-specific incidence of dementia has declined over the past 4 decades among FHS participants (in press). However, the reasons for this decline remain unclear. We thus propose to continue tracking temporal trends in AD dementia and MCI through intensive surveillance, and verifying diagnoses at autopsy. We hypothesize that better education, treatment of some vascular factors and protective lifestyle changes (diet, activity, social engagement) may partially explain these trends. AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention. Whereas the total number of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages, we have 4 decades of Framingham data suggesting that the risk at any given age is declining. We plan to study the reasons for this hopeful trend in detail through continuing our surveillance for dementia and cognitive impairment, collecting cutting edge brain imaging (amyloid and tau-PET, volumes, connectivity and perfusion on MRI) in the dementia-free (preclinical AD), and using sophisticated analysis of very extensive genetic and omic data already collected on Framingham subjects. This could help us better understand AD trends and biology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.   ","Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts",9759741,R01AG054076,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug Targeting', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Social Network', 'Spin Labels', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time trend', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'base', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genome wide association study', 'good diet', 'grandparent', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'personalized risk prediction', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'social engagement', 'tau Proteins', 'tractography', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend', 'vascular factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2019,2404965,0.26700957105653655
"Socially-Assistive Robots for AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs (SARA) Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this Phase I Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) effort is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a socially integrative and supportive robot system to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). One in 10 people 65 and older has AD, with estimates of up to as many as 5.5 million Americans currently living with AD. Because of the loss of cognitive function and subsequent changes in employment and reduced engagement with social groups and hobbies, AD/ADRD patients often experience loneliness and social isolation, and the considerable challenge of caring for these individuals often causes similar effects in caregivers. If successful, SARA will have significant impact on AD/ADRD patient care and quality of life, reducing loneliness and social isolation.  The specific aims of this two-year pilot study are to: (1) adapt commercial robot and peripheral hardware to create accessible interactions for AD/ADRD patients; (2) design and develop the robot interaction software to provide rich, supportive interaction; and (3) assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of SARA with AD/ADRD older adults and their caregivers. SARA employs user-community-driven design processes and evaluations to address key challenges surrounding how to best apply commercial robots and engaging interaction methodologies to improve AD/ADRD patient care. We will develop SARA through an iterative development process that produces and evaluates three versions of the system during the Phase I effort.  SARA is significant in three ways. SARA reduces loneliness by providing robotic social interactions. SARA reduces social isolation by connecting the patient more closely with family, friends, and caregivers, both directly and through social media. SARA provides social assistance in three ways: (1) through automated reminders and question answering for everyday information that is easily and often forgotten by patients; (2) conveyance of health regimens (e.g., What can I have for lunch? Should I still exercise today?); and (3) monitoring for caregivers.  SARA contains three central innovations. First, to create a user experience that is well tuned to the needs of patients and caregivers, SARA is created with significant feedback from AD/ADRD patients and caregivers. Second, to enable us to build on multiple robotic platforms that can meet this user experience, and to provide future extensibility, SARA features a platform-agnostic software and hardware framework that can integrate with a wide range of consumer social robots. Third, to create engaging, believable, and effective interactions with AD/ADRD patients, SARA uses and extends an AI-based architecture, Hap, which is specifically designed to create socially engaging interactive characters and robots that provide enjoyable and stimulating interactions. Project Narrative  As many as 5.5 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s disease, an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, eventually impairing the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks. Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) is a socially integrative and supportive robot to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD).

"Assessing the effectiveness of oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of underutilization due to dementia, recurrent falls, or poor anticoagulation quality Despite the markedly increased risk of stroke, nearly 50% of older adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) did not follow clinical guidelines to receive anticoagulation therapy. Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementia (AD/ADRD), and other features highly associated with AD/ADRD, including falls, and difficulty in maintaining good anticoagulation quality when receiving warfarin are among the major barriers of oral anticoagulant (OAC) prescribing. These factors also complicate the decisions regarding the optimal choice among specific OACs and appropriateness of switching a warfarin user to receive one of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), which have more predictable pharmacokinetic profiles and cause less intracranial hemorrhage than does warfarin. Despite the seemingly abundant data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and routine-care settings, there was very little data evaluating the effects of OACs specifically in patients with AD/ADRD and its associated high-risk features, leaving large numbers of AF patients with AD/ADRD unanticoagulated without clear guidance. Because RCTs are unlikely to recruit and retain older adults with AD/ADRD that is representative of the patients in routine care, we aim to address these critical knowledge gaps with a combined dataset incorporating rich clinical information from electronic health records and longitudinal claims data covering >3 millions nationally representative Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and above with non-valvular AF from 2011-2018, using state-of-the-art methodologies. Our specific aims include: 1) Determine comparative effectiveness and safety of use vs. non-use of oral anticoagulants in patients aged 65 and above with non-valvular AF and AD/ADRD (stratified by a validated activities of daily living [ADL] score and use of dementia medications), and/or high-risk features associated with AD/ADRD, including poor predicted anticoagulation quality and high risk of falls assessed by a validated algorithms; 2): Determine comparative effectiveness and safety of warfarin vs. specific DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) in patients aged 65 and above with non-valvular AF and AD/ADRD, and/or high-risk features associated with AD/ADRD; 3) Determine comparative effectiveness and safety of switching to a DOAC vs. continuing warfarin in chronic users of warfarin aged 65 or older with non-valvular AF and AD/ADRD, and/or high-risk features associated with AD/ADRD. Successful accomplishment of this study will provide data to help clinicians estimate accurately the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation therapy in the vulnerable older adults with AD/ADRD and non-valvular AF, which will 1) support optimal use and b) avoid unnecessary withholding of an OAC. Importantly, this research will also produce a novel, generalizable approach to evaluate treatment effect heterogeneity of drug therapy by important clinical factors using both electronic health records and health insurance claims data with optimal validity and estimation precision. The proposed research aims to investigate how treatment effects of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are affected by presence of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementia (AD/ADRD), and other features highly associated with AD/ADRD. This study is relevant to public health because it is expected to generate evidence that can help clinicians choose the optimal anticoagulation regimen in the many older adults with AD/ADRD and atrial fibrillation based on readily observable clinical features. Our study will also produce a generalizable analytic approach integrating several advanced methods to evaluate treatment effect heterogeneity by key clinical factors with optimal validity and estimation precision.","Assessing the effectiveness of oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of underutilization due to dementia, recurrent falls, or poor anticoagulation quality",9711944,RF1AG063381,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Guidelines', 'Health Insurance', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'International Normalized Ratio', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medication Errors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Stroke prevention', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Warfarin', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care delivery', 'comparative effectiveness', 'dementia risk', 'evidence base', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'frailty', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'routine care', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'stroke risk', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,RF1,2019,2150379,0.16564563430257065

"Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been identified as one of the strongest genetic determinants of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In general, the e4 allele is associated with reductions in neural protection and repair, increasing a carrier’s vulnerability to damage accumulated over his/her lifetime. Nevertheless, while the penetrance of ApoE e4 is relatively high, a significant proportion of e4 carriers will never develop AD. The overall goal of this project is to model interactions across multiple omics networks to identify the biological pathways involved in sporadic AD susceptibility versus resilience among high-risk individuals. The multifactorial nature of AD suggests that it may manifest as a result of complex interactions across the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Identifying the central networks involved in AD pathogenesis will require integrative Systems Biology approaches. The proposed research offers a new and innovative way to integrate networks—a dominant feature in biology—across multiple tissues and omics platforms, in order to identify innate and dynamic precursors of resilience to AD, among a high-risk population (e4+). Towards this goal, we will: (1) employ newly developed GWAS-based network analysis, to identify SNP networks that alter the association between ApoE e4 and cognitive decline/dementia; (2) generate DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from brain samples that we will analyze using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (3) generate proteomic data from brain and CSF samples that we will analyze using WGCNA to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (4) use advanced integromic network analysis to identify multi-omics and multi-tissue pathways and biological systems involved in AD resilience. The integration of multiple 'omics' data using systems biology will be crucial for unraveling the connections and interactions between various functional levels involved in complex diseases, such as AD. Overall, our proposed research will improve understanding of the complex biology underlying AD susceptibility. These studies have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets that could inform the development of future pharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing or slowing AD pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with the ApoE e4 genotype have a substantially increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this project is identify underlying biological interactions and networks that explain why some e4 carriers do not develop Alzheimer's disease, despite being high-risk. This research has the potential to uncover novel targets that can lead to the development of effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers,9741614,R01AG057912,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'resilience', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,671108,0.238501232457794
"Center for Identification and Study of Individuals with Atypical Diabetes Mellitus (U54) Diabetes is traditionally classified in two broad categories: autoimmune Type 1 and obesity-related Type 2. Numerous phenotypically and etiologically distinct forms exist and are emerging, collectively termed “atypical diabetes” (AD), that do not fit into either category. We hypothesize that AD comprises a spectrum that includes numerous forms, both known (e.g, MODY/monogenic, Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults, Ketosis-Prone Diabetes) and unknown. We propose to establish the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE). The goals of CADRE are to (1) identify and define comprehensively the forms of AD; and (2) establish an extensive database and repository of biosamples from AD patients. Defining the forms of AD is challenging because the etiology of AD can range from a single gene variant to a highly complex mixture of genetics, epigenetics and environmental factors. To identify patients with AD, and then to define the forms, we will use a two-pronged approach. Approach (a) will use clustering analysis of genotypic and phenotypic data from diverse groups of patients with diabetes. We have recruited 15 domestic and international population cohorts with data on more than 33,000 patients with diabetes. Further, we have recruited six diabetes study clinics (Baylor College of Medicine [BCM], University of Washington [UW], Indiana University [IU], Emory University, University of Colorado, and SUNY Downstate) who will prospectively recruit patients. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation will facilitate recruitment from patient groups. The Administrative Core at BCM will work with cohorts and clinics to obtain data. The University of South Florida (USF) will filter data for AD and separate patients into phenotypically homogenous clusters that can be diagnosed based on genetic and clinical features unique to the cluster. Approach (b) will identify monogenic, oligogenic and mitochondrial forms of AD from patients enrolled in genetics registries (BCM) and a family study with genetic data (Botnia). The BCM registries include patients referred to the Undiagnosed Disease Network. All patients will undergo whole-exome and mitochondrial genome sequencing (Cores at BCM), single-nucleotide polymorphism variant analysis (Oxford), metabolomic analysis (Duke) and phenotypic analysis of C-peptide, adiponectin, proinsulin, islet autoantibodies, and serum insulin DNA levels (Cores at UW and IU). To establish the database and biorepository, we will invite patients with AD to participate in sample donation and longitudinal follow-up via the cohorts and clinics. Data and samples will be transferred to the Database and Biorepository Core at USF, with input and tracking implemented using the successful framework developed by USF for large multicenter trials. Data will be made available through the NIDDK and a CADRE website and samples will be made available through ancillary study application. Ongoing patient recruitment to expand the database and biorepository will occur through the study clinics and clinician referral through the CADRE website. Overall, CADRE will be built on a foundation of existing, successful core facilities and computational systems to create a lasting resource that will substantially advance AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE For many people with diabetes, their symptoms do not match those usually associated with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We will use medical and genetic information from a large number of patients with diabetes to find all the forms of “atypical diabetes,” so doctors can better diagnose and treat these patients. We will also make the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE) to keep data and samples from patients with atypical diabetes, so scientists can study these forms of diabetes.",Center for Identification and Study of Individuals with Atypical Diabetes Mellitus (U54),9781712,U54DK118638,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Ancillary Study', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diabetes', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological Markers', 'C-Peptide', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorado', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Complication', 'Core Facility', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunology', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Proinsulin', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'college', 'data sharing', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'diabetes mellitus genetics', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic registry', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'insight', 'islet', 'learning strategy', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'patient registry', 'phenotypic data', 'polypeptide C', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'repository', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'web site']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U54,2019,2500000,0.11885513467974429
"Machine Learning Model Validation for AD/ADRD PROJECT SUMMARY The primary goal of this Administrative Supplement is to study 20 candidate genes, previously not associated with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), in ADRD-relevant experimental models. These genes were identified by machine learning derived from meta-path-based protein knowledge graph integration. ADRD continues to be an intractable age-related neurodegenerative illness in elderly without a cure. Numerous clinical trials have failed in result in effective therapeutic management of ADRD. This unprecedented 99.6% failure rate in drug development targeting ADRD is, in part, due to lack of sufficient consideration of novel molecular pathways and mechanisms besides the ones neuropathologically associated with different dementias. The main thrust of this proposal is to use automated algorithmic network predictions based on the meta-path approach, by providing the integrated database developed at the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Knowledge Management Center (KMC). Based on 13 distinct datasets totaling over 261 million datapoints, the AD-specific machine learning classifier model identified several key features, such as proteins that mediate inflammatory processes (JAK2, IL10 & IL2), response to oxidative stress (GSTP1), nervous system development (BDNF) and glycolysis (GAPDH). As a preliminary validation, we used human SHSY5Y cells that show robust hyper- phosphorylation of tau at S202 (itself a predictor of neurofibrillary tangle pathology relevant to ADRD) upon inflammatory stimuli (treated with cell supernatant from RAW macrophages). We used individual siRNA knockdown for the 20 predicted candidate genes in SHSY5Y cells prior to RAW macrophage media treatment, and assessed pS202-tau by Cellomics® unbiased high-content microscopy and quantitative morphometry. Four out of 20 candidate genes altered pS202 -tau levels in SHSY5Y cells, thus providing a proof-of-concept validation for the AD machine learning model. Based on this, we hypothesize that the AD-specific model is able to reliably identify novel biological datasets relevant to ADRD. We propose to test this hypothesis under three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will improve the meta-path machine-learning models and data mine novel associations. In Aim 2, we will perform in vitro biological validation for the top genes predicted by the meta-path approach. In Aim 3, we will build an interactive web platform to disseminate AD-gene associations. Successful completion of these studies will open up new avenues for ADRD research and may lead to novel therapeutic targets for ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the discordance between neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, ADRD, (e.g., amyloid beta pathology) and failed attempts to clinically manage ADRD therapeutically, there is an urgent need to identify novel drug targets. The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program, to which this supplement is linked-to, plans to utilize its integrated database to develop machine learning models that can predict novel disease-protein associations. Specifically, a set of 20 genes not previously associated with ADRD, were predicted using machine learning. Of these, 4 genes show significant biological effects (regulating hyperphosphorylation of tau at S202) in ADRD-relevant cellular models. The goals of this administrative supplement are to enhance machine learning models, to provide biological validation of candidate genes predicted from machine learning, and to propose novel drug ADRD targets.",Machine Learning Model Validation for AD/ADRD,9719312,U24CA224370,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area Under Curve', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Balance training', 'Biological', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Experimental Models', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GSTP1 gene', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'IL2 gene', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Resources Management', 'Interleukin-10', 'Internet', 'Ion Channel', 'JAK2 gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retroviridae', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Sports', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tauopathies', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Transfection', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'candidate validation', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'forest', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'knowledge integration', 'macrophage', 'morphometry', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nervous system development', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'response', 'small hairpin RNA', 'tau Proteins', 'web app', 'web interface']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,U24,2018,378750,0.08477201331081535
"Disparities in the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Among African American and European American Veterans Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that currently affects more than 5 million Americans, a number that is expected to triple by 2050. The National Plan to Address AD has articulated a vision for the development of specific treatments for AD by 2025, and it is critical that minorities and Veterans be included within the scope of this projected research progress. However, the diagnosis of AD is complicated by the lack of confirmatory diagnostic tests and the presence of other comorbid processes, including cerebrovascular disease, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury. These issues have contributed to a significant underdiagnosis of AD among Veterans, particularly among African Americans (AAs).  Considering diagnosis of AD in an ethnic minority context means paying particular attention to AAs, who have estimated dementia prevalence and incidence rates that are about two times higher than the rates in European Americans (EAs). There is also evidence of racial disparity in dementia care, though the magnitude of this disparity is unknown. To better understand the magnitude of the underdiagnosis of AD, this proposal will leverage the big data resources of VHA, where ~0.6 million AA Veterans who are age 65+ receive care—this is one of the largest samples of older AAs with associated electronic health records (EHRs) in the U.S. Given that it is infeasible to conduct manual record reviews or in-person evaluations in every Veteran served by VHA with undiagnosed AD, Specific Aim 1 will develop an AD-status model by applying novel weakly supervised machine-learning methods to the EHRs of 22,000 AA and EA Veterans who are age 65 or older. These weakly supervised methods are novel in that they will permit data mining within a large number of EHRs, including both structured and unstructured data, without initial human annotation or labeling. By developing an AD-status model in this way, the proposed work will avoid the potential limitations of past natural language processing studies of AD, which used predetermined search terms to generate models and were not sufficiently accurate. Specific Aim 2 will conduct medical record reviews and telephone assessments, the “silver standard” for diagnosing AD, in 600 randomly selected Veterans and their caregivers. This combination of machine learning and follow-up assessment, which has not been previously utilized in AAs or AD, will enable the validation and refining of the AD-status model so that it can predict the likelihood that AA Veterans are true AD cases. In this way, the proposed interdisciplinary team of dementia specialists, bioinformaticists, and biostatisticians will likely demonstrate the rapid and efficient detection of complex and costly disorders like AD. This has the potential to lead to earlier and more accurate diagnoses of AD, which can then improve Veteran access to medical and psychosocial supports and delay institutionalizations. Thus, future investigations of short- and long-term biomedical, pharmacological or system-level AD interventions will be feasible in AAs. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasingly common neurodegenerative disorder that is underdiagnosed in African Americans. To help reduce AD-related health disparities, we will use novel weakly supervised machine- learning methods in VHA's electronic health records, to develop a model that detects undiagnosed AD.",Disparities in the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Among African American and European American Veterans,9760728,R56AG059739,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Attention', 'Big Data', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Force of Gravity', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutionalization', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Silver', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'dementia care', 'demographics', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease classification', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow up assessment', 'health administration', 'health disparity', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'racial disparity', 'research study', 'statistics', 'vision development']",NIA,SEATTLE INST FOR BIOMEDICAL/CLINICAL RES,R56,2018,353403,0.30102746358342775
"Quantifying Brain Abnormality by Multimodality Neuroimage Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes, afforded by multimodality neuroimaging data, for both diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's diseases (AD).

"CRCNS:  Pooling Multisite data and Staistical Tests for analyzing biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease Recent developments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging research suggest that reducing future  cases may be feasible by preventing AD in high-risk individuals by initiating  treatments prior to neurodegeneration. Identifying such individuals requires  characterizing the earliest stages of dementia when individuals are still asymptomatic  and early disease effects are weak. To detect subtle (faint yet persistent) effects, large  sample sizes are typically needed, but existing studies are not sufficiently large to provide high  statistical power. Motivated by this critical need, this project will develop the statistical  theory and algorithms needed to pool multi-cohort Alzheimer's disease datasets to facilitate large  scale statistical analysis in samples of cognitively unimpaired individuals who are still  asymptomatic. The development will be driven by (a) new shape analysis methods to characterize  brain anatomy at the individual level and (b) statistical machine learning algorithms to enable  seamless pooling of data from different studies/cohorts. Specific Aim 1: Develop novel shape  analysis methods which enable testing advanced hypotheses in a way that is largely invariant to  study-wise biases in Alzheimer's disease datasets collected at two different research sites  (DELCODE, WRAP/WADRC) using compact descriptors of individual level brain anatomy  (neuroanatomical signatures). Specific Aim 2: Derive new statistical theory and  algorithms, based on classical statistical constructs and deep learning, for  harmonizing shape features and other clinical/cognitive features focused on early  Alzheimer's disease across the two sites. Specific Aim 3: Perform association and  prediction analyses on the pooled datasets to evaluate novel scientific hypotheses related to early  stages of Alzheimer's disease. We will analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, shape features   and longitudinal cognition (slopes/intercepts) and finally conduct analyses to better  understand heterogeneity and sub-groups within the pooled cohort of cognitively unimpaired adults.  Significance: This project will (i) lead to the development of efficient shape representation  frameworks that will allow testing advanced localized hypotheses on brain regions of interest  without requiring sub-field segmentation. The impact of these shape analysis methods will support  spatially localized brain image analysis in Alzheimer's disease and in aging studies more  generally. (ii) Produce harmonization algorithms and statistical theory to enable large scale  data pooling in Alzheimer's disease as well as a broad range of other aging and neuroscience studies. Alzheimer's disease is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States. This project is expected to shed new light on the early neurodegenerative processes that occur in Alzheimer's disease, as well as facilitate early detection of disease by providing the means to combine and analyze a large pooled dataset of MR images, CSF biomarkers, behavioral data and clinical evaluations collected among research participants evaluated in Wisconsin and Germany. New insights that emerge from this project are expected to facilitate future pooling of large datasets, as well as inform the design of new studies and development of new therapies for Alzheimer's disease and improve the health and well-being of many aging Americans.",CRCNS:  Pooling Multisite data and Staistical Tests for analyzing biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease,9692899,RF1AG062336,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intercept', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Process', 'Race', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Syncope', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'brain shape', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'middle age', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'shape analysis', 'societal costs', 'theories', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,RF1,2018,659973,0.07327689832784608
"Multi-modal machine learning detection and tracking of traumatic brain injury neurodegeneration and its differentiation from Alzheimer's disease SUMMARY The proposed research focuses on the use of neuroimaging and machine learning to detect and understand the progression of neurodegeneration caused by repetitive brain trauma, and to differentiate this from that caused by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias. The deliverables defined in this Phase I stage will support the development of a commercial software product for use in pharmaceutical clinical trials and in clinical diagnosis. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has been shown to cause cognitive deterioration and other symptoms that overlap those arising with AD. TBI can also lead to the development of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which shares similarities in brain atrophy and tau accumulation with AD. There is mixed evidence as to whether TBI increases the risk or rate of developing AD, but regardless, the likelihoods of co-morbidity and misdiagnosis become high as individuals age. The relevant population includes professional sports athletes, individuals who played head contacting sports during high school or college, military veterans, and persons experiencing falls. However, the process by which TBI causes progressive damage, and the ways in which it can best be discriminated from AD, have not been determined. The aims of this grant focus on characterizing the progressive structural and pathology effects of TBI and discriminating these from AD using imaging of structure, function, and pathology, and machine learning. Classifiers will be developed using these information types alone and in combination. Innovations of this work include the use of a unique, comprehensive data set of imaging, cognitive, and other data acquired on more than 600 fighters by the Cleveland Clinic, a database of more than 10,000 well-characterized scans from persons across the spectrum of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic AD and other dementias, and a sophisticated machine learning software platform that addresses issues such as data overfitting and validation. Specific Aim 1 focuses on characterizing neurodegenerative changes that occur in fighters using volumetric (T1 weighted MRI) and white matter (Diffusion Tensor, DTI) imaging. Aim 2 will characterize tau accumulation in fighters and its relationship to and structural changes, comparing the two tracers 18F-AV1451 and 18F-FDDNP. Specific Aim 3 will determine methods to differentiate TBI related neurodegeneration from AD using structural and tau imaging. Follow on work in Phase II will include model refinement and additional validation with additional independent data, further prediction of cognitive impairment, extension to functional imaging modalities ASL and fMRI BOLD, dissociation of co-existing TBI and AD, comparisons to other forms of trauma, and development of software tools for commercialization. This work can have significant societal benefit through improved detection of TBI effects and precursors to greater damage and impairment, and accurate differentiation of AD and other dementias versus TBI effects to support optimal patient care. NARRATIVE This research addresses a critical gap in the understanding of the neurodegenerative effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and the ability to differentiate effects of TBI from those caused by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative dementias. Advances in machine learning will be applied to a unique multi-modality data set acquired in over 650 boxers and mixed martial arts fighters who have experienced varying exposure to head trauma and years since trauma was incurred, and to a data from a set of more than 10,000 scans acquired in persons at varying stages of mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Outcomes of the research will enable a diagnostic tool to be developed that enables differentiation of TBI effects from those of other dementias, and that increases the understanding of the path by which TBI can cause progressive cognitive impairment.",Multi-modal machine learning detection and tracking of traumatic brain injury neurodegeneration and its differentiation from Alzheimer's disease,9622939,R43AG060861,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Craniocerebral Trauma', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissociation', 'Education', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Martial Arts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Normal Range', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'chronic traumatic encephalopathy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'college', 'commercialization', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'fighting', 'head impact', 'healthy volunteer', 'high school', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'model development', 'neurodegenerative dementia', 'neuroimaging', 'pre-clinical', 'sex', 'software development', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIA,"ADM DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,208181,0.22140749829361292
"Brain-Computer Interface to Enhance Attention in Alzheimers Disease Summary  This administrative supplement proposes to add a group of adults with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the parent award R01DC009834. We will implement the same experimental methods that were approved in Specific Aims 2 and 4 of the parent award with this additional clinical population. The outcome measure of changes in Information Transfer Rate (ITR) as a result of training remains the same and we are adding two secondary behavioral measures for reading skills that were approved by the NIDCD program officer.  Individuals with AD present with attention and language deficits secondary to their dementia syndrome. Reading impairments are typical, and affect daily activities ranging from reading text (such as menus or magazines) to reading salient cues in their environment for wayfinding. The supplement goal is to enhance attention and reading skills in people with mild AD through a visual-attention-to-letters training paradigm. The training uses a letter-based brain-computer interface (BCI), the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) Keyboard system, which was already established in the parent award. It displays letters while EEG is recorded and uses a machine learning classifier and language model to decide the user's intended letter.  It is proposed that BCI training improves attention and fundamental reading skills in adults with mild AD. We plan to recruit 24 participants with possible or probable AD and language impairment from the NIA-funded P30 Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center of which Barry Oken, MD, PhD is associate director. AD Center recruitment ensures all participants are diagnosed and characterized using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center guidelines. Participants will present with a Global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 – 1 and deficits in reading, and will pass an established cognitive screen for RSVP Keyboard BCI use. Participants enroll in a single arm intervention with multiple baseline A-B design and outcomes measures obtained 3 times before and 3 times after intervention in a 2-month period. Two training opportunities are planned. First, participants perform a BCI RSVP calibration task twice weekly for 6 weeks. Feedback about attention and intended letter selection accuracy are provided based on P300 waves. Second, participants view a simulated RSVP Keyboard for 15 minutes daily on home computers as a process-specific attention training task. Three outcome measures are: (1) ITR, an EEG (P300) measure related to attention; (2) sentence reading fluency; and (3) letter-word identification. Reading skills are assessed with standardized, valid subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Achievement. It is hypothesized that ITR, reading fluency and letter-word identification skills are improved with the training. This supplement strengthens the current assistive technology research program and provides data for a larger research agenda on translational BCI skills and training paradigms for individuals with cognitive and motor impairments, including those with AD. Project Narrative It is estimated that 5.7 whom million Americans of all ages are living with Alzheimer's dementia in 2018, many of can benefit frominterventions to improve attention and letter reading abilities. The RSVP Keyboard Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) provides automated training to improve cognitive skills and addresses vigilance to letters so individuals can rely on reading and greater attention to text for daily activities and wayfinding so that individuals can remain active in their communities.

"5R01GM120033-02 Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining Supplement Proposal ABSTRACT  In response to the NOT-AG-18-008, we are submitting a supplement to our parent R01 5R01GM120033-02 to extend the proposed work to Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Within our R01 award, we are developing two powerful new automated algorithms to capture biomarkers of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s Disease. Both of these tools capitalize on recent developments in machine learning; one of them, NMRQuant, has already been validated on simulated and phantom nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data and is ready to be applied to biological samples. We propose to examine the plasma samples obtained from the Texas Alzheimer’s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC), which prospectively collects demographic, environmental, neuropsychosocial, and genetic data along with the biofluid samples, in consecutive 1-year follow-up analyses that track various health outcomes. We hypothesize that progression of cognitive dysfunction from mild cognitive impairment to AD are accompanied by quantifiable changes in small molecules and metabolites in peripheral plasma. We will test this hypothesis on patients with AD, those with mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls. We are uniquely positioned to advance biomarker and diagnostics tools as well as screening methods for cognitive deficits in AD, given that we have access to the state-of-the-art equipment, data collection expertise, and new analytical algorithms with superb sensitivity and specificity for NMR spectral data. Application of NMR metabolomics to AD could provide diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cognitive status, which is necessary for measuring both disease progression and treatment response. This work may thus hold a promise to bring transformative data to the field of AD. NARRATIVE As we seek to develop treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD) and other forms of cognitive decline, it is important to develop sensitive and specific biomarkers that can monitor disease progression and therapeutic response. The metabolome is a dynamic and sensitive biological system, reflecting both innate processes and environmental influences, and thus, to a great extent, an organism’s health and homeostasis. In this study, we will use metabolomics platform to examine plasma from a large cohort of prospectively followed healthy individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment, and those with AD, collected by the Texas Alzheimer’s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC).",5R01GM120033-02 Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining Supplement Proposal,9719311,R01GM120033,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Equipment', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Work', 'biological systems', 'data mining', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'follow-up', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,232653,0.18138341063533392
"Role of the Extracellular Matrix in the Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disorder: Regulation by OTX2 Project Summary. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is increasingly conceived as a disorder of the synapse. Yet, despite decades of investigations, the relationship between synaptic pathology and well established β-amyloid and tau pathology is not well understood. Emerging evidence strongly indicates that the extracellular matrix (ECM) may represent a critical element in this relationship, largely neglected thus far. The ECM, a molecular network representing 20% of the brain volume, plays a key role in neuroprotection, synaptic stabilization and plasticity, and interacts with β-amyloid and tau. It organizes into aggregates such as perineuronal nets (PNNs), organized ECM perisynaptic structures enveloping neuronal populations and regulating synaptic stabilization and neuroprotection. Based on preliminary data showing a dramatic loss of PNN integrity and significant changes of ECM composition in AD, we put forth that the ECM may represent a key element of pathophysiological mechanisms involving synaptic, β-amyloid and tau pathology in AD. However, little is known about expression and function of ECM and their relevance in Alzheimer Disease. Our central hypotheses for this supplemental application are that ECM abnormalities, mediated by altered expression of the transcription factor OTX2 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), may represent a key link between synaptic disruption and β-amyloid and tau pathology in AD, potentially contributing to cognitive decline in this disorder. We will test our hypotheses through two specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will expand our robust preliminary dataset on OTX2 and extracellular matrix regulation probing the dysregulation of OTX2, MMPs and ECM in AD. Specifically, this aim will test the hypothesis that a dysregulation of OTX2 and MMPs in the choroid plexus is part of an upstream signaling cascade responsible for a disintegration of PNN/ECM and subsequent synaptic loss in the brain parenchyma, specifically the amygdala. Specific Aim 2 will use machine-learning technologies to extract symptom dimensions based on the NIH RDoc definitions from tissue donors' records including a model of cognition that has been validated against neuropsychiatric testing. This process will be scaled up to develop a rich multi-dimensional phenotypic index and integrated with results from studies in Specific Aim 1. The large subject cohort to be used for these studies will allow us to further develop and validate this approach. Project Narrative. The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because the discovery of molecular mechanisms leading to cognitive decline and dementia in post-mortem human brain tissue of aged individuals, subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy donors will provide crucial insights into the pathophysiology of AD. This will provide conceptually new ways to think about the pathophysiology of this disorder and lead to novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. Thus, the project is relevant to the NIMH/NIA's mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the nature of mental disorders, and aging in particular as well as the application of that knowledge to cure and prevent mental health and aging-related disorders.",Role of the Extracellular Matrix in the Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disorder: Regulation by OTX2,9718659,R01MH104488,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Autopsy', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enzymes', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Role', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'aged', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'brain parenchyma', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'early detection biomarkers', 'health record', 'indexing', 'insight', 'neglect', 'neuropathology', 'neuroprotection', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'postnatal human', 'prevent', 'scale up', 'sex', 'symptomatology', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic target', 'time interval', 'transcription factor']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2018,369858,0.16184021779269603
"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve access and engagement in AD research among disadvantaged groups.",Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research,9589379,K76AG060005,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exclusion', 'Faculty', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired cognition', 'Improve Access', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Readiness', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care episode', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic minority population', 'group intervention', 'health disparity', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'screening', 'success', 'symptom management', 'willingness']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K76,2018,242555,0.2509122804076777
"Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a growing epidemic, and potential treatments are unlikely to be effective unless deployed during the earliest stages of AD, prior to cognitive symptoms. Currently there are no inexpensive, non-invasive biomarkers for effective AD screening necessary for early recognition and treatment on a broad scale. Sleep is abnormal in preclinical AD, even prior to cognitive symptoms, and disrupted sleep may in turn accelerate AD pathological mechanisms. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures brain function, and the stereotyped nature of sleep EEG offers a particularly rich opportunity to identify biomarkers of brain dysfunction due to AD. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that sleep-wake brain mechanisms are abnormal very early in AD, and can be detected via subtle but distinct sleep and EEG changes. The objective is to develop sleep and EEG biomarkers of AD, to enable non-invasive and inexpensive screening on a large scale, through the following specific aims.  Aim 1) Identify sleep-wake patterns across the 24-hour day characteristic of AD pathology. Ambulatory sleep-EEG data will be recorded over the 24-hour period in the home setting from a large, diverse, community-based cohort, with the hypothesis that increased sleep-wake transitions over the 24-hour day are characteristic of preclinical-to-mild AD. Aim 2) Assess slow wave integrity measures as biomarkers of AD pathology. EEG abnormalities of slow wave sleep are particularly associated with elevated amyloid-β levels and plaques. Novel analytic techniques will extract bihemispheric slow wave coherence, slow wave velocity, and slow wave intradaily ratio from EEG data collected during sleep and wake. The hypothesis is that amyloid plaques present in early AD will reduce slow wave integrity by all three measures. Aim 3) Determine the EEG signature of AD using machine learning. Machine learning techniques will be applied to EEG from a full attended overnight polysomnogram, to identify a “signature” of AD pathology. The goal is to identify a “signature” that can be detected with spatially limited EEG data that could be collected at home.  The expected outcome of these aims is to identify sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD that can be detected noninvasively and inexpensively at home. The impact of our work will be the ability to screen large populations easily for AD pathology, so that affected individuals can be identified and treated. Moreover, sleep-EEG biomarkers could be used to track disease progression and treatment response in clinical trials for AD. Lastly, since sleep disturbance has a direct effect on AD pathology, by identifying sleep-EEG changes very early in the pathological process, we may be able to intervene, improve sleep, and potentially change the trajectory of AD.  ! Project Narrative Combating the looming crisis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will require identifying and treating individuals with AD even before cognitive symptoms appear. The proposed project will develop sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD in a large, diverse, community-based cohort, which can be used for inexpensive, non-invasive screening for AD on a broad scale. This project will enable large-scale screening and treatment of early AD, use of sleep-EEG theranostic biomarkers for clinical and drug-development purposes, and intervention for sleep disturbances to potentially change the trajectory of AD.",Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,9559968,R01AG059507,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Drug Development', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Napping', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Race', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'combat', 'cost', 'early detection biomarkers', 'improved', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep onset', 'sleep quality', 'tau Proteins', 'theranostics', 'treatment response']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,403908,-0.023612987352256875
"Dementia Screening Using Automated Speech Analysis: A Pilot Study Project Summary Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is vital if treatments are to be most effective, yet for myriad reasons, a staggering number of older Americans do not receive diagnostic services. Recent technological breakthroughs show considerable promise to identify biomarkers for AD, but nonetheless still require costly and often invasive in-person testing. What is needed is a new approach that can rival current technologies in terms of diagnostic accuracy, while also permitting wider accessibility and economy. The ubiquitous telephone will be the vehicle for this approach in the proposed study. Telephone-based diagnostic screening tests have emerged as a viable alternative to in-person testing, and appear well tolerated and cost-effective. These tests are effective at detecting frank dementia, yet lack sensitivity to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) a likely risk factor for AD. Deficits in language function, particularly semantic knowledge, are characteristic of AD, and these changes may occur decades prior to the emergence of overt symptoms. Research from our group has demonstrated that automated speech analysis can quantify aspects of semantic knowledge in psychiatric samples and can provide similar information to human raters in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Hence, our goal is to determine the acceptability, sensitivity and specificity of an automated speech analysis approach to the detection of AD and MCI from speech samples elicited via telephone. Such an approach has the potential to greatly outperform current screening methods, not only in terms of sensitivity to cognitive decline, but also accessibility, cost, and user satisfaction. If successful, this project could form an integral part of an adaptive, machine learning decision support system to accurately predict an individual's dementia conversion threshold and trajectory of decline. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease is a significant and mounting public health concern, yet for a host of reasons, a staggering number of older Americans do not receive a diagnostic evaluation. The proposed study seeks to address this issue by leveraging a device ubiquitous in many homes: the telephone. Speech samples elicited via telephone will undergo computerized analysis, with a view to identifying cognitive decline at an early stage and potentially reaching many more people at a fraction of the cost of currently-available screening tests.",Dementia Screening Using Automated Speech Analysis: A Pilot Study,9524622,R03AG052416,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic screening', 'indexing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel strategies', 'research clinical testing', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'success', 'symptomatology']",NIA,MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,83008,0.03509674234502122
"Alzheimer's Amyloid and Tau Pathology Staging and Clinical Impact Prediction Using Multi-Modal MRI Pattern Classification SUMMARY This Phase I grant will use innovative machine learning approaches and brain image data to address the critical need to identify the presence and extent of Alzheimer’s disease pathology for clinical diagnosis and treatment evaluation. Misdiagnosis rates currently exceed 20% and diagnosis is not available in early stages of disease, impeding patient care and the development of effective treatments. Combining innovations in machine learning with recently available information from tau PET imaging, classifier and regression models will be developed that can predict amyloid plaque and tau distribution, using structural and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. These advances can greatly improve the early, accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, enable the selection of patients for clinical trials, and aid in the development of effective new therapeutics. In the first Specific Aim, multivariate machine learning classifiers will be developed using structural MRI, functional MRI (ASL), and FDG PET as a comparator to characterize amyloid and tau pathology and disease stage in patients with Alzheimer’s disease ranging from presymptomatic through dementia stages. Second, within-classifier and across-classifier performance will be evaluated with respect to the objectives to: discriminate subjects with amyloid and tau pathology; provide a metric of tau burden and spatial distribution using MRI and FDG PET modalities; and identify neurodegenerative patterns that may reflect differences in clinical severity among patients with the same tau burden and distribution. In addition, the relationship between classifier scores and cognitive endpoints will be evaluated. Third, similar classifiers will be developed using structural MRI and FDG PET to characterize amyloid and CSF tau burden in a genetically predisposed, early onset AD population, and findings compared to those in the late onset AD population. This work makes use of data acquired in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the DIAN study of early onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s Disease (ADAD), and additional data sets. Innovations of this work include: prediction of tau burden and distribution using imaging measures of neurodegeneration; application of our machine learning methods and optimization to recently available modalities and measures; unique approaches in machine learning optimization and classifier design; and the inclusion of Late Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD) and ADAD data sets and initial comparison between these forms of AD. Achievement of these aims will result in diagnostic and prognostic image analysis tools to aid in accurate diagnosis and prognosis supporting patient care and the clinical evaluation of therapeutic interventions. NARRATIVE! This Phase I grant uses innovative machine learning approaches and brain image data to address the critical need to diagnose the presence and extent of Alzheimer’s disease pathology for clinical diagnosis and treatment evaluation. Using sophisticated software tools, algorithms will be developed that can predict the amount of amyloid plaque and the distribution of aggregated tau, two hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is widely used in clinical trials and in the clinic.

"Computational Prediction and Functional Validation of Novel Epigenetic Risk Loci in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the United States but has no disease-modifying treatments. AD is also a substantially genetically based disease but the heritability of AD declines with older ages-at-onset suggesting increased environmental contributions at older age. We propose to study the AD epigenome since it is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Here, we will study DNA methylation at the fifth position of cytosine, which could modulate transcriptional activity. We propose an innovative machine learning computational approach to discover new AD-associated methylation sites beyond what can be interrogated by array-based approaches. We propose to use machine learning classification models trained on existing AD epigenetic studies and publicly available, multi-omics data to generate an AD-specific “risk score” for each methylation site in the genome by leveraging the tremendous investment in AD research, particularly the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD), and the Molecular Mechanisms of the Vascular Etiology of Alzheimer's Disease (M2OVE-AD). We predict that high scoring methylation sites will associate with AD, and we will test this prediction with a 2-stage (discovery/replication) study using a unique dataset of human postmortem brains from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) and an autopsy dataset from Emory University's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). Simultaneously, we propose functional studies in model systems to determine whether the selective identified loci could influence AD pathogenesis.  In Aim 1, we propose to build machine learning models and using the models to obtain, AD-specific “risk scores” for each of the 28 million methylation sites in the genome In Aim 2, we propose to test our models using a unique dataset of 1695 human postmortem brains from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) and 432 postmortem human brains from the Emory ADRC. Both ROS and MAP are prospective longitudinal studies annually collect data cognitive, mental, and physical health, and has the requisite available tissue and data from genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dPFC). We propose a 2-stage genetic study to validate whether predicted methylation sites are associated with AD. In Aim 3, we will examine the functional consequences of top AD-associated “risk scores” in relevant model systems, including fly, mammalian cell culture and mouse models of AD.  This project can potentially identify important molecular contributors of AD that might not be apparent through other approaches, leading to new insights into mechanisms and treatment targets for AD and thereby have an important and sustained impact on public health.

"Computational Prediction and Functional Validation of Novel Risk Loci of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the United States but has no disease-modifying treatments. AD is also a substantially genetically based disease. Despite the fact that tens of new loci have been uncovered by GWAS to be AD-associated, the majority of the genetic component of AD remains unexplained. We propose an innovative machine learning computational approach to discover new AD genetic loci that leverages the tremendous investment in AD research including the following projects: Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD), and the Molecular Mechanisms of the Vascular Etiology of Alzheimer’s Disease (M²OVE-AD). We propose to use machine learning classification models trained on existing AD genetic studies and publicly available, multi-omics data to generate an AD-specific “risk score” for each base in the genome. To test these models, we propose a 2-stage (discovery/replication) study using a unique dataset of human postmortem brains from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS). Simultaneously, we propose functional studies in model systems to determine whether the selective identified loci could influence AD pathogenesis.  In Aim 1, we propose to build machine learning models and using the models to obtain genome-wide, AD-specific “risk scores.” These scores will identify novel loci in the genome that increase AD risk were a mutation to be present there. In Aim 2, we propose to test our models using a unique dataset of 1695 human postmortem brains from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS). These prospective longitudinal studies annually collect data cognitive, mental, and physical health, and has the requisite available tissue and data from genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dPFC). We propose a 2-stage genetic study to validate genetic associations with AD by testing whether rare variants in the locus associate with AD or whether there is differential CpG methylation at the locus associated with AD. In Aim 3, we will examine the functional consequences of top AD-associated “risk scores” in relevant model systems, including fly, mammalian cell culture and mouse models of AD.  This project can potentially identify important molecular contributors of AD that might not be apparent through other approaches, leading to new insights into mechanisms and treatment targets for AD and thereby have an important and sustained impact on public health.

"Validation of a novel prospective circulatory biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease using the ADNI dataset. Summary This supplement will evaluate the utility of hemodynamic parameter maps extracted from resting state fMRI data, as early markers of cerebrovascular dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). We have developed a method to derive maps of cerebrovascular function and dysfunction from resting state data, including through retrospective analysis of existing public datasets. These metrics are sensitive to both macrovascular and microvascular changes. In healthy tissue, vasodilation modulates cerebral perfusion in response to changing demands for oxygen and nutrients; this ability is reduced or absent in many forms of cerebrovascular pathology. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), is a measure of brain blood vessels’ capacity for vasodilation, which offer useful information on the health of local vasculature. Traditional analysis methods of hypercarbic CVR data underestimate CVR magnitude in regions where the response is delayed with respect to the gas administration schedule, and give no information at all about blood flow delay, a crucial feature of vascular dysfunction. We have validated a method to quantitatively map delays in blood flow arrival, and other hemodynamic parameters, even in the absence of external manipulations, allowing us to differentiate the circulatory and metabolic components of cerebrovascular compromise from resting state data alone. We have already demonstrated the utility of this approach in primarily circulatory disorders, such as stroke and moyamoya disease; this supplement seeks to establish the utility of this approach to probe early circulatory dysfunction in AD. Specific patterns of local alteration in circulation may precede (or even lead to) neuronal degeneration, and may serve as an effective biomarker for following disease progression. This supplement would be used to test this hypothesis in two ways. First, we will add a focused cohort of patients with mild cognitive impairment or probable mild Alzheimer’s Disease (16 subjects) to our active protocol studying subjects at risk for stroke. We will perform an abbreviated version of our extensive circulatory evaluation protocol to determine circulatory markers of early AD relative to our comparison group. Second, we will perform a broad retrospective analysis on the resting state fMRI data in the ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database to measure circulatory parameters in a very large group that includes a range of diagnoses, and longitudinal data from a subset of subjects, to determine how regional bloodflow changes with disease progress. Finally, we will design and test machine learning classifiers to evaluate the ability of these circulatory markers to detect early AD/PRAD. These complementary efforts will test the hypothesis that specific, regional patterns of circulatory alteration progress with Alzheimer’s Disease, and may in fact precede other symptoms, allowing early, objective and quantitative detection of AD, and tracking of disease progression. Furthermore, this will serve as excellent preliminary data for designing more comprehensive efforts to develop this technique as an effective clinical tool. Narrative Cerebral hemodynamics plays an important role in Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. However, existing assessment methods are not well suited to fully quantifying blood flow in pathology in the presence of delayed blood flow; delayed blood arrival is often misinterpreted as blood volume or flow decreases. In this supplement, we will extend our novel fMRI processing methods for extracting high quality hemodynamic parameters, including blood flow delay, from resting state fMRI data, currently being used to assess stroke risk, to examine the circulatory changes seen in early Alzheimer’s disease, in order to evaluate these parameters as an early biomarker to predict disease progression.",Validation of a novel prospective circulatory biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease using the ADNI dataset.,9717641,R01NS097512,"['Addendum', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gases', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hypercapnia', 'Image', 'Intracranial Arterial Stenosis', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Moyamoya Disease', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurons', 'Nutrient', 'Oxygen', 'Parietal', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Reaction Time', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stroke', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vasodilation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'cerebral blood volume', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular pathology', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'deep learning', 'design', 'early detection biomarkers', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'prospective', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'stroke risk', 'tau Proteins', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'white matter']",NINDS,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2018,299561,0.106675003022453
"Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. While research efforts continue to focus on the causes of AD and to develop effective medical treatments, there is also a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. There may be subtle changes in brain and cognitive function that are detectable before major symptoms emerge. One approach for characterizing these vulnerabilities is the use of functional and structural neuroimaging to identify risk profiles for AD. The present study proposes and tests a model of AD pathology using neuroimaging network analysis and machine learning approaches to provide insight on widespread changes in information processing in the AD brain. The proposed model hypothesizes that some aspects of network information processing reflect neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD pathology (e.g., hub connectivity and global connectivity) whereas other network properties reflect attempts to compensate for compromised information processing (e.g., diffusion of information). In addition, this proposal compares the efficacy of models with respect to discriminating diagnostic categories (e.g., machine learning classification of AD and clinically normal subjects) versus isolating underlying dimensions of AD cognitive decline (e.g., machine learning prediction of memory and language scores from network features). Finally, this study will determine whether features of AD pathology are present in an at-risk sample of subjects; namely, individuals diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This will be examined by transferring the AD network models to aMCI subjects and testing whether the model can discriminate aMCI from clinically normal matched controls and whether the model can predict scores on cognitive tests. The analytic approach will using resting state fMRI data as a primary assay of network integrity, but diffusion imaging and task fMRI data will also be examined in an exploratory aim. The general approach will recruit individuals with AD, aMCI and clinically normal matched controls for each diagnostic group. The groups that are compared directly will be matched for amyloid status, as indicated by florbetapir PET imaging. The novel contributions of this project include (a) testing a network model of AD pathology that unifies various measures of network functioning, (b) comparing efficacy of modeling with respect to delineating diagnostic categories versus capturing underlying cognitive dimensions of AD, and (c) transferring the AD model to an at-risk group to assess disease vulnerability. This latter innovation can be applied in future studies to any group of subjects that is defined at risk, such as those with genetic vulnerability or positive family history. The present study also sets the stage for a subsequent longitudinal follow-up study to validate whether individuals identified at risk using network modeling actually convert to AD. Ultimately, network modeling of this sort may be used as a relatively less expensive and less invasive biomarker than PET imaging, which could lead to earlier treatments and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years, there is a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. The present study will use neuroimaging to examine brain connectivity and determine whether some aspects of altered connectivity are present in individuals who are at risk for AD: individuals who have mild cognitive impairment. This approach could be used in the future to possibly detect risk for AD before any cognitive symptoms emerge, thereby enabling earlier treatment and intervention to combat the devastating cognitive, social and financial consequences of AD.",Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease,9566966,R01AG055132,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Center for Health Statistics', 'Well in self', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'combat', 'comparative efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'response', 'social']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2018,745812,0.2600295958559278
"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens. Feasibility rests with prior studies on evolution, networks, systems, and text-mining that demonstrate accurate predictions of deleterious mutations and their clinical sequelae and the discovery of drivers of diseases. Broadly, this work will yield proof of principle for a novel quantitative model that integrates fundamental concepts from mathematics and molecular evolution, and for a low resolution but large-scale map of biomedical knowledge in which network notions of distance computed by machine learning identify relevant functional hypothesis that would otherwise be easily overlooked. The result will be a new experimental ability to unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship in Alzheimer's Disease so as to guide drug therapy. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease projected to rise dramatically in our aging population. To develop drugs against it, we propose to train machine learning on the DNA of patients with Alzheimer's to detect genes with abnormal mathematical features in their mutations. Then, we will place these genes in a “map”, which represents a large fraction of biomedical knowledge in a high-dimensional network. The drugs that fall near our genes of interest in this map are our candidates, and experiments will test in cell and mouse models whether they affect the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's.",A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs,9641478,R01AG061105,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Animal Model', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Calculi', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Production', 'PubMed', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'database structure', 'disorder risk', 'drug testing', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gene function', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interest', 'molecular modeling', 'mouse model', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'protective factors', 'screening', 'stem', 'success', 'synergism', 'tau Proteins', 'text searching', 'virtual']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,792498,0.0927567374263761
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9718452,UH3NS100599,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Microscopic', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Public Health', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sclerosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'White Matter Disease', 'age related', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo evaluation', 'in vivo imaging', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'pathology imaging', 'protective factors', 'treatment response', 'vascular risk factor']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH3,2018,1165858,0.09357514952780385
"High-Resolution J-Resolved MRSI for Metabolic Imaging in Early AD AD is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. AD  is increasingly viewed as a disorder of cerebral glucose metabolism, which is known to start up to  two decades before the clinical manifestation of AD. Several consensus statements have hence  highlighted the need for metabolic biomarkers to differentiate AD induced brain changes from other  forms of dementia, especially since pharmaceutical agents to treat AD are emerging. Highly specific  and sensitive quantitative biomarkers of abnormal glucose metabolism, which can facilitate  longitudinal studies, are urgently needed for the early detection and management of Alzheimer’s  disease (AD).  The main goal of this proposal is to develop a practical and reproducible J-resolved magnetic  resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) framework on a 7T scanner to probe abnormal metabolism in  early AD subjects. The focus of the parent grant is to develop a short protocol for  multi-parametric (T1, LGE, CINE) cardiac MRI using non-Cartesian sequences & machine learning. In  this supplement, we propose to extend the computational framework and non- Cartesian sequences  introduced in the parent grant to exploit the higher SNR offered by ultra- high field magnets (e.g  7T) to overcome the challenges in MR spectroscopic imaging. This approach will enable the accurate  estimation of the concentration of J-coupled metabolites that have significant overlap in 1-D MRSI.  Our previous supplement is facilitating the specificity and spatial resolution of T1rho, which is a  metabolic biomarker for acidosis resulting from accumulation of waste products in AD. This  proposal, if successful, will enable us to complement the acidosis biomarker with a broader array  of metabolites which will enable us to characterize the various stages of the pathological cascade  in early AD. Thus, this supplement will facilitate the development of a metabolic MRI toolbox, which will greatly  strengthen research on AD and related dementias. The proposed project addresses the development of a novel algorithms and pulse sequences for  J-resolved MR spectroscopic imaging.

"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High-Order Brain Networks Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High- Order Brain Networks Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with no known disease-modifying treatment. Current clinical diagnosis and monitoring of the disease are primarily based on subjective neuropsychological and neurobehavioral assessments, which are generally susceptible to large variability. Objective biomarkers that are sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis and monitoring purposes are hence critically in need. Neuroimaging fits this need and provides objective measures and markers of preclinical disease states for aiding researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitoring their effectiveness. Since AD- related neurological degeneration occurs long before the appearance of clinical symptomatology, additional diagnostic information during the prodromal phase of AD, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is of paramount importance for the success of treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning diagnostic framework based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) for accurate AD diagnosis at the individual level, so as to promote early detection for possible treatment and prophylaxis. Achieving this goal requires significant technical innovations to empower researchers the ability to detect sophisticated yet subtle alteration patterns in brain function. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will harness the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity to provide additional information for accurate identification of individuals who are at risk for AD. This is significantly different from most existing methods that assume temporal stationarity and are therefore unable to take advantage of temporally-evolving connectivity information for more fine-grained characterization of rapidly changing brain states. In Aim 2, we will extract high-order information from functional networks, beyond the commonly used region-pair correlation, for characterizing functional synchronization of the interactions of multiple pairs of regions. This overcomes the over-simplistic pairwise-interaction assumptions of existing methods, and thus allows greater capacity to model complex brain circuitry. In Aim 3, we will fuse information across imaging modalities to complement functional networks with both the white-matter structural networks (generated using diffusion MRI) and the morphological networks (generated using cortical thickness information from anatomical T1-weighted imaging). This will allow complementary information from different modalities to reinforce each other in improving diagnostic accuracy. Upon successful completion of this project, we expect that the resulting comprehensive, integrated, and effective diagnosis framework will be conducive to improving the success of early detection of MCI/AD, as well as other neurological disorders including schizophrenia, autism, and multiple sclerosis. Narrative Description of Project AD-related neurological degeneration occurs long before the appearance of clinical symptomatology. Information provided by neuroimaging data, which is sensitive to pathology during the prodromal phase of AD, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is of paramount importance for the success of diagnosis and treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning diagnostic framework based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) for accurate AD diagnosis at the individual level, so as to promote early detection for possible treatment and prophylaxis.",Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High-Order Brain Networks,9550978,R01EB022880,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain circuitry', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comparison group', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neglect', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'web site', 'white matter']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,380000,0.16587679884884307
"Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology. Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple health threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, efforts in drug discovery and repurposing for the treatment of AD have had limited success. The failure is largely attributed to the adoption of a reductionist model of “one-drug-one-gene- one-disease”. As AD is a multi-facet complex disease, a new treatment approach is urgently needed to simultaneously target multiple pathological processes responsible for the onset and progress of AD, some of which are also common to other diseases that cause dementia. In this application, we will develop an innovative translational bioinformatics approach to addressing challenges in AD drug discovery. Our approach is based on a new paradigm of systems pharmacology, which focuses on defining multiple targets to a single drug or a drug combination, and studying the effect of the drug(s) on perturbing disease-causing networks. Over the last ten years, we have developed a novel structural systems pharmacology (SSP) platform that can predict genome-wide high-resolution protein-chemical interactions and correlate molecular interactions with phenotype responses. The SSP platform synergistically combines novel methods from machine learning, bioinformatics, biophysics, and systems biology. We have successfully applied the SSP platform to drug repurposing, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, precision medicine, and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, and in close collaborations with experimental laboratories, we will develop, and rigorously test a novel SSP approach to AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology. Firstly, we will develop a drug-gene-disease multi-layered network model (MULAN) that links FDA-approved drugs with neurodegenerative diseases through protein-chemical interactions, gene- disease associations, and chemical-disease associations through integrating multiple omics data. Secondly, we will improve and apply our proven successful SSP platform, which can accurately infer novel relations from sparse and noisy MULAN, to identify safe FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed for AD treatment. Finally, we will experimentally test FDA-approved drugs identified for their binding activity of drug targets and anti-AD potency in cell and animal models. The successful completion of this project will provide an integrated computational modeling framework for AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology as well as identify novel targeted anti-AD therapeutics toward pre-clinical trials. Relevance Statement Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, AD is a complex disease that has been extremely hard to treat with the conventional approach. New methods that can reuse old drugs to target mulple pathological processes in AD may provide new solutions to effective AD treatment.",Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology.,9659737,R01AG057555,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biophysics', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diazoxide', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Human', 'Inflammation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'clinical application', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical development', 'preclinical trial', 'response', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic candidate', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2018,779392,0.17494336494087726
"Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer Disease (AD), and the existing studies have suggested that the individuals with amnestic MCI tend to progress to probable AD at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year. Early prediction of MCI patients with high risk of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Recent advances in acquiring multi-dimensional and longitudinal brain imaging and genome-wide array data provide exciting new opportunities to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. Integrating such multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data holds great promise for a system biology of the brain to better understand the complex neurobiological mechanism of conversion of MCI to AD. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these neuroimaging genomic data sets have presented critical computational challenges for achieving the full transformative potential from comprehensive joint analysis of these heterogeneous and longitudinal data sets. This project aims to address these emerging challenges for early prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion with four aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel sparse bi-multivariate learning model based system biology framework for analysis of genome-wide association results across a large number of the structural and functional phenotypes derived from neuroimaging scans of the whole brain. Our new methods are designed for bi-multivariate analysis of high-throughput genomic data and complex Quantitative Traits (QTs) related to MCI-to-AD conversion by utilizing the system biology knowledge. Aim 2 is to further extend the learning approaches in Aim 1 with the new structured sparse models to the multi-dimensional data integration methods to identify the heterogeneous biomarkers from multiscale interrelated imaging genomic data for outcome prediction. Meanwhile, we will utilize the joint multi-task learning scheme to identify the stable genetic and phenotypic biomarkers that are associated with cognitive functions decline and MCI-to-AD conversion simultaneously. Based on the studies in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 is focused on revealing the longitudinal biomarkers of the changes of MCI progression or cognitive impairment by a new structured low-rank multi-task regression model. These biomarkers can fully differentiate longitudinal profiles of relevant QTs and better capture genetic associations with QT changes over time. Aim 4 is to evaluate and validate our proposed machine learning and bioinformatics algorithms on both synthetic data and real imaging genomic data. The results of this project will be able to efficiently improve our understanding of the complex neurobiological mechanism underlying the MCI-to-AD conversion. The identified biomarkers will finally enhance the early and accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion such that the clinical treatment can be provided in time. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Existing research works mainly focus on the studies using single genetic or neuroimaging data source and seldom consider the longitudinal data profiles. To address these limitations, this project focuses on 1) the development of novel bioinformatics and machine learning models for solving the computational challenges of analyzing the emerging multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data, and 2) identification of biomarkers with prediction power on MCI-to-AD conversion from the large and complex heterogeneous imaging genomic data with the comprehensive system biology knowledge guidance.",Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction,9477405,R01AG049371,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'case control', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'simulation', 'success', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,398140,0.1891014609949589
"Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate is an epileptologist and neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, whose long-term career goal is to become an independent- ly funded translational investigator with expertise at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive co-morbidities. The ability to translate the clinical experience, research tools, and intellectual framework from the field of epilepsy to that of the neurodegenerative diseases, and vice versa, could be a powerful approach to studying both processes. During the proposed training period, the candidate will combine her prior training in epilepsy, EEG signal processing, and machine learning, with newly acquired skills in neuroimaging (functional MRI), biostatistics, and additional clinical exposure to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Cash, an expert in epilepsy and neurophysiologic signal processing, and the co-mentorship of Dr. Reisa Sperling, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuroimaging approaches, the candidate proposes to: 1) Delineate the spectrum of epileptiform activity in early stages of AD and develop computa- tional tools to identify this activity; 2) Establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie epileptiform activity in AD; and 3) Determine how epileptiform abnormalities are associated with cognitive trajectories in patients with early stage AD. Visual and computational analysis of 24- hour scalp EEGs will be integrated with resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements, amy- loid PET imaging, and longitudinal cognitive testing from subjects with AD, to develop a com- prehensive understanding of the role of epileptiform abnormalities in early stages of AD. In addi- tion to the research proposed, the candidate’s career development plan entails rigorous coursework and seminars, practical hands-on experience, and close guidance from a board of academic advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow the candidate to establish a clinical and research niche at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases, and to develop a comprehensive toolbox with which to probe human brain function from the standpoint of neurophysiology, structure, connectivity, and tar- geted pathology. Collectively, these will form the foundation for a successful career as an inde- pendent investigator pursuing important clinical and translational research projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, or both. Project Narrative People with Alzheimer’s disease are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and people with epilepsy commonly suffer from impairments in memory and cognition. Our goals are to better understand the interplay between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and to determine whether epileptiform activity may be a treatable contributor to cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. This has important public health implications, as according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a treatment that slows the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s disease by five-fold would reduce the number of people with severe Alzheimer’s disease from 6.5 million to 1.2 million and reduce Medicare costs by 50% by the year 2050.",Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease,9526093,K23NS101037,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Technical Expertise', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2018,200880,0.15163632965214582
"Di-Leu-enabled multiplexed quantitation for biomarker discovery and validation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly population. While several peptide and protein biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been used for AD diagnosis, an unequivocal diagnosis in the early phases of AD is still lacking. Perhaps more importantly, the discovery and establishment of reliable biomarkers capable of monitoring progression and degree of cognitive impairment as well as potential efficacy of therapy remains a major challenge. Furthermore, the correlation between CSF protein/peptide biomarkers and changes in the brain structure/function and cognition is not well established. In order to address these challenges and fill in existing knowledge gaps, we propose to employ a multi-faceted approach combining a suite of mass spectrometry-based technologies enabled by innovative multiplexed tagging strategies, bioinformatics tools and clinically-available measures to discover, identify and evaluate potential biomarkers of AD in CSF obtained from asymptomatic cognitively-healthy middle-aged adults, older cognitively-normal adults, and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. We propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 – To conduct in-depth analysis of site-specific glycoproteome and endogenous glycopeptidome in CSF from subjects in control, preclinical, MCI, AD groups, respectively. Specific Aim 2 – To discover and identify a panel of candidate glycoprotein/glycopeptide biomarkers at different stages of AD using multiplexed dimethylated leucine (DiLeu) reagents-enabled quantitative glycoproteomics approach along with machine learning classification algorithms for improved diagnosis of AD. Specific Aim 3 – To validate the CSF AD biomarkers, in plasma samples collected from individuals with MCI and dementia, using targeted quantitative proteomics approaches and ELISA assay along with association with AD-related clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging measures. This project uniquely integrates advances in MS-based multiplexed quantitative glycoproteomics and bioinformatics tools with neuroimaging and clinical measures to enable more comprehensive discovery and validation of CSF biomarkers in AD.  The proposed research will be performed in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team of investigators including Drs. Cynthia Carlsson, Henrik Zetterberg, Ozioma Okonkwo and David Page. This multifaceted approach will enable identification of biomarkers of AD in CSF that offer improved sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and predict dementia onset and progression. These biomarkers would be invaluable in designing therapeutics for patient care and more efficient clinical trials of disease modifying therapies. The advances in technology and new insights will have broad impact on translational medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly population, affecting more than 5 million Americans and 15 million people worldwide. The development of effective disease-modifying therapeutics for AD would greatly benefit from in vivo biomarkers, preferentially those that tag the very earliest stages of the disease. It is critical to establish a panel of valid biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring its progression, or even prevent it by targeting several pharmaceutical candidates. Despite several existing biomarkers for AD, they do not capture the heterogeneity of the disease and more importantly, lack the sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis. To address this key challenge and knowledge gap, this proposal aims to develop an innovative multi-faceted approach enabled by ultraplexed protein quantitation technology and new advancements of MS instrumentation allowing in-depth site-specific glycoproteomic mapping coupled with advanced bioinformatics tools and clinical neuroimaging for novel AD biomarker discovery and validation. The successful outcome of this research will have broad impact on translational medicine and will have profound impact on the physical and emotional health of millinois of individual patients at risk for this devastating diease.",Di-Leu-enabled multiplexed quantitation for biomarker discovery and validation in Alzheimer's disease,9449167,RF1AG052324,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Antibodies', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical Process', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Coupled', 'Defect', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissociation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electron Transport', 'Emotional', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Glycopeptides', 'Glycoproteins', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Isomerism', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Leucine', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Validation', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker validation', 'blood-based biomarker', 'comparative', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'glycoproteomics', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'protein biomarkers', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,RF1,2018,2424837,0.2423792126322317
"Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people worldwide. Due to the fact that the longitudinal abnormality associated with AD can be detected in vivo, neuroimaging measures have been playing an increasingly important role in searching for biomarkers of AD that can be used for early diagnosis, progression monitoring, and therapy responses measurement. The goal of this project is to create a set of cutting-edge computational tools for identifying very early biomarkers of AD and alert AD progression via longitudinal image analysis. The key to achieve high sensitivity and specificity AD diagnosis of individuals is the stable longitudinal measurements. In light of this, the candidate will first develop a novel learning-based 4D (3D+t) landmark detector (Aim 1) to find the landmark locations at all time points simultaneously. The trajectories of landmark set form a compact 4D shape representation to achieve temporal consistency in registering longitudinal image sequence to the template (Aim 2). As a result, the consistency of low level features extracted from MR or PET images can be significantly improved. Since the subject-specific patterns of structural/functional changes, although more relevant to AD diagnosis of individuals, is very subtle compared to huge variation across subjects, the candidate will further develop a supervised deep neural network to learn the latent high-level spatial-temporal patterns by coupled stacked auto-encoder and temporal max pooling (Aim 2). The learned spatial-temporal morphological patterns consist of (1) cross- sectional features from MR and PET images, and (2) dynamic short/long term longitudinal patterns w.r.t. different number of historical time points. In a clinical setting, not all patients have a large and complete set of neuroimaging data, or an equal number of imaging scans. In order to eventually translate to clinic arena, a novel AD detector that uses a spatial-temporal hyper-graph learning framework (Aim 3) is proposed to not only provide high sensitivity and specificity in AD diagnosis but also solve the above difficulties. To evaluate the diagnostic value, we will apply our trained AD detector to ADNI dataset and patient data collected in UNC (Aim 3). Finally, we will package all our developed methods into a software package and release it freely to the neuroimaging community, to facilitate other AD-biomarker-exploration projects performed in other institutes. Project Narrative This proposal aims for the development of novel neuroimaging analysis methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal image data. In particular, a set of automated algorithms will be created to aid the difficult task of analyzing subtle and complex morphological change patterns of Alzheimer's disease during the disease progression. The successful completion of this project will represent an import milestone in neuroimaging research by bringing forth the fruition of a powerful and practical system for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at individual level, for potential effective treatment.",Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,9484199,K01AG049089,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evolution', 'Fruit', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'disease diagnosis', 'early detection biomarkers', 'economic cost', 'effective therapy', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'functional loss', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'social', 'specific biomarkers', 'task analysis', 'tool']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2018,117098,0.2173188403503302
"PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in adults over the age of 65, and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the leading cause of dementia in middle age, with the behavioral variant subtype (bvFTD) being the most prevalent form. The relationships between clinical syndromes and pathological causes are complex, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult. For example, multiple studies have indicated that a significant proportion of cases of AD-like dementia show evidence of non-AD pathology, such as inclusions of the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein associated with clinical FTD. Also, AD neuropathology has been found in 15–30% of patient with the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers will be needed, so that they can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient populations. In this project, we will focus on clinically diagnosed bvFTD and AD patients, and apply machine learning to multimodal neuroimaging (T1, FDG-PET) data pooled from large, multisite studies of AD and FTD. Our goal is to develop novel biomarkers that can differentiate bvFTD, AD and controls. Our hypothesis is that each neuropathology is associated with a distinct biomarker signature, and these signatures can be discovered through well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical profiles. We will use available amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of β-amyloid and tau to assess the robustness of our predictions of AD neuropathologies. In Aim 1 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal structural imaging to develop predictive biomarker models for differentiating bvFTD vs. AD. In Aim 2 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal FDG-PET imaging to develop predictive biomarker models. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the combination of structural and FDG-PET imaging as predictive biomarker models.  Relevance: This research supports NIH initiatives on long-term, personalized precision medicine and big data science. Our predictive biomarker models can inform participant selection in clinical trials so that we can identify disease-modifying treatments with greater power. Our system-biology approach can enable us to generate new questions on mechanisms underlying the origin and progression of neuro-pathological processes, create new data and computational tools that can in turn generate new insights and new hypotheses. NARRATIVE  Accurate diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is difficult because the relationships between clinical syndromes, and pathological and genetic causes are complex. In this project, we propose to use machine learning technologies to develop powerful predictive biomarkers that can distinguish bvFTD, AD and healthy controls, using well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical data from multiple national databases. As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient populations.",PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis,9562019,R01AG055121,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'accurate diagnosis', 'amyloid imaging', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'biomarker development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'mutation carrier', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non-alzheimer dementia', 'novel marker', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'search engine', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'tau Proteins']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,657921,0.1920546167742397
"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET- positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points – baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD all measures; controls – clinical and cognitive measures only) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow more than 400 people with EOAD in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS),9568150,U01AG057195,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Language', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Presenile Alzheimer Dementia', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Procedures', 'Psychometrics', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'age related', 'biomarker development', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder control', 'genetic risk factor', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'presenilin-1', 'recruit', 'risk variant', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment trial']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2018,8285753,0.20113652045061486
"Cognitive heterogeneity in those with high Alzheimer's Disease Risk The lack of an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to a call to detect the disease earlier in its course but AD's insidious onset that can span many years, adds complexity to doing so. As a result, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has identified to understand the heterogeneity of AD, particularly at the asymptomatic stages as a research priority. While there are well-documented high AD risk factors (e.g., age, apolipoprotein E4, cardiovascular risk, amyloid and tau pathology), diagnosis is not inevitable, but it remains unknown why only some of those with high AD risk progress to disease and others do not. We contend that one challenge for answering this question is that by the time traditional AD preclinical symptoms of memory decline and/or hippocampal atrophy emerge, the neurodegenerative trajectory is already on a near irreversible course. We further hypothesize that traditional measurement methods produce crude measures that mask the broader range of clinical expression in the preclinical period and preclude the earliest opportunity to detect the beginning of the neurodegenerative trajectory. In this application, we seek to leverage the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cognitive aging and dementia database, acquired through nearly 7 decades of prospective examination. Unique to FHS since 2005 has been the collection of novel NP indices (error responses, digital metrics such as item-level latencies, fragmented responses). Baseline data were collected at a time when the vast majority of these participants appeared asymptomatic, including those who are at high AD risk, a subset of which have since progressed to incident AD as well as similarly high AD risk subgroups who did not. We will use this unprecedented resource to 1) characterize the cognitive heterogeneity of these high AD risk groups as they do and do not progress to disease, 2) determine whether traditional neuroimaging biomarkers differentiate between progressors and non-progressors and 3) develop novel machine learning methods to identify neuroimaging indices even earlier than traditional MRI measures. We predict that compared to traditional neuropsychological (NP) scores, our novel NP measures will produce unique cognitive profiles that better differentiate those at high AD risk who do and do not progress to AD, that the NP profiles of high AD risk progressors will be associated with AD neuroimaging markers (e.g. decline in total brain and hippocampal volume, increase in white matter hyperintensities) while the NP profiles of high AD risk non-progressors will not show similar evidence of brain structure changes. We will also develop an adversarial learning framework to enhance baseline MRI images to serve as better predictors of high AD risk progressor and non-progressor groups than the original images. Results will lead to identification of a broader spectrum of preclinical presentation in those with high AD risk than has been previously recognized and thus better characterize the heterogeneity of NP performance, particularly earlier in the disease course, potentially identifying a critical period in which intervention strategies can mitigate disease risk. This study seeks to characterize the heterogeneity of cognitive profiles among those who are at high risk for Alzheimer's disease and differentiate those who do go on to disease and those who do not. This study is enhanced by novel cognitive data that include digital metrics that permit more extensive characterization of unique cognitive profiles in these high risk groups.",Cognitive heterogeneity in those with high Alzheimer's Disease Risk,9784932,R56AG062109,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal database', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'virtual']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R56,2018,517295,0.2313558111263251
"Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting 1 in 8 individuals over 65 years old in the US. Within AD, approximately 40-60% individuals are affected by psychotic symptoms (AD+P), which are associated with more rapid cognitive decline, greater disability, mortality and caregiver burden, resulting in a disproportionately large disease burden. Recent studies indicate a genetic basis for AD+P risk, but the molecular basis of AD+P remains largely uncharacterized, hindering the search for appropriate treatments and novel therapeutics. In this proposal, we seek to systematically dissect the mechanistic basis of AD+P by systematic generation, integration, and experimental dissection of transcriptional and epigenomic phenotypes across two brain regions and four cell types. (1) We profile single-cell RNA-seq and cell-type specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq across 192 post-mortem brain samples, each in two regions across AD patients with psychosis, AD patients with no psychosis, schizophrenia patients with no AD, and control individuals. (2) We integrate the resulting datasets with genetic information and GWAS data to predict driver genes, regions, variants, and pathways underlying AD+P using state-of-the-art machine learning methods for causality, mediation analysis, and genetic Bayesian fine- mapping. (3) We use our computational predictions to guide a systematic dissection of the molecular underpinnings of AD+P using a modular and programmable CRISPR-Cas9 methodology in iPSC lines to modulate regulatory elements, genes and alleles, and measure the resulting molecular and cellular phenotypes in cell-autonomous and non-autonomous phenotypes. If successful, this ambitious proposal has the potential to provide the first mechanistic insights on the development of psychotic symptoms in AD+P and/or P-AD, reveal functional risk variants and target genes for therapeutic intervention that will likely influence clinical management in order to alleviate the personal and societal burden associated with these disorders.

"The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Genomic studies for late-onset AD (LOAD) have identified over 20 risk loci; however, translating the relevant molecules identified by genomics to AD-specific mechanistic pathways has been challenging. Our application, entitled “The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline Revealed by Next- Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,” is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing a uniquely innovative molecular imaging platform called multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) that will determine high dimensional protein interactions for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomics studies in normal and pathological states. Our proposal has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze four regions in healthy aged brains: two sectors of the hippocampal pyramidal layer and from two isocortical regions. Next- generation MIBI instrumentation will be used to image simultaneously 30+ proteins that mark subtypes of neurons, synapses, and non-neuronal cells, while covering regulatory signaling, neuro-inflammatory components, and AD risk gene protein products with subcellular resolution. In Aim 2, we propose to use the same multiplexed imaging methods in AD brain stratified by APOE genotype. We will analyze these data with statistical machine learning methods already established in our laboratory, similar to what we have done previously with different cancers and the immune system. In Aim 3, using infrastructure we have already have established, we will create a web-based portal where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi- color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features we derive shared freely. We propose a transformative, collaborative approach to AD that leverages a long-standing NIA-funded longitudinal cohort and is highly responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan. These novel insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets and will create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD. Project Narrative AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate a phenotypic landscape of cognitive decline, to understand modulation of cognitive decline during compensation and relate genetic predisposition to changes in phenotypic landscape defined by muti-parametric measurements using enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI).  ",The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,9537395,R01AG056287,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Electrons', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Laboratories', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Middle frontal gyrus structure', 'Molecular', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'burden of illness', 'collaborative approach', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'disability', 'gene product', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'mental state', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'symposium']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,537162,0.2274197174991437
"Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction Project Summary/Abstract  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects millions of Americans, yet there are no treatments that meaningfully affect disease progression once symptoms manifest. This has shifted the focus to early detection and intervention, which is thought by many researchers to offer the best chance of slowing or stopping the progression of AD. However, trials aimed at averting the underlying causes of disease have proven difficult because pathological changes in AD happen well in advance of cognitive decline. A widely-available genetic test for determining AD risk early in life, while prevention might still be possible, would allow early treatment intervention, enrollment in clinical trials, and improved patient stratification for testing treatment effectiveness. However, despite recent advancements, genetic risk prediction models (GRPMs) for late-onset AD (LOAD) lack sufficient discrimination ability to support such applications. Given the lack of effective treatments once symptoms have manifested and the socioeconomic consequences at stake, there is a serious unmet need for a widely-available GRPM able to accurately assess a patient's risk in middle age or earlier, before neurodegeneration begins.  To address this need, Parabon has teamed with AD researchers from Washington University and Emory to develop a GRPM able to accurately predict an individual's risk of developing LOAD at various ages. Phase I demonstrated that this GRPM, which exploits diagnostic heterogeneity, non-additive (epistatic) interactions among variants, and machine learning, significantly outperforms traditional risk factors. In Phase II, the GRPM will be further optimized, validated, and commercialized as a direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic health risk assessment test. In Aim 1, thousands of new and existing case and control subjects with genotypes and detailed phenotypes will be added. In Aim 2, novel approaches to feature selection for epistatic interactions will be implemented to increase the generalizability of selected features. In Aim 3, the selected genomic features will be used to predict imaging and biomarker endophenotypes of LOAD. In Aim 4, the out- of-sample endophenotype predictions will be combined into a final predictive model for AD diagnosis that can be applied to new subjects at any age, which will be validated in an independent replication set. Finally, in Aim 5, data and results will be prepared for scientific publication and submission to the FDA for marketing authorization as a DTC genetic health risk assessment system. Project Narrative Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects millions of Americans, yet there are no treatments that significantly slow disease progression once symptoms manifest, making early intervention crucial to reduce the individual and societal burden of this disease. This proposal seeks to create a genetic risk prediction model that can predict an individual's AD risk at any age, which will be made widely available as a direct-to-consumer genetic health risk assessment. It will enable early intervention and life planning for at-risk individuals and allow researchers to maximize the probability of detecting treatment effects in clinical trials by assessing patients' underlying disease risk.",Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction,9678858,R44AG050366,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area', 'Authorization documentation', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'biobank', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'middle age', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment effect', 'whole genome']",NIA,"PARABON NANOLABS, INC.",R44,2018,579228,0.17285600756894426
"The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD Project Summary Improving vascular health for delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is identified as a critical goal by the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Conference, the 2015 NIA AD Summit and PAR-15-356 (to which this application is responding). Yet, critical barriers exist to implementing vascular prevention strategies for AD, and elucidating the role of midlife metabolic, macro- and micro- vascular factors in AD is essential to addressing these barriers. Each type of factor may manifest different pathologies in the brain that contribute to dementia sub-types, making a new and sufficiently comprehensive clinical trial a costly and time-consuming undertaking. To address this essential gap, we propose to leverage the rich longitudinal cohort data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study with the addition of detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain neuroimaging – the MESA VASCAD study. MESA participants at the Wake Forest site (46% African-American, 54% non-Hispanic Caucasian) have already undergone extensive metabolic and vascular phenotyping, repeated retinal imaging and a brief cognitive assessment in 2010-2012. The MESA VASCAD study will add clinical and cognitive assessments (Uniform Data Set and supplemental cognitive tests); neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid PET); and reanalysis of retinal images. We propose to enroll 540 MESA participants in 2 years and repeat assessments 3 years later to more fully characterize targeted, modifiable vascular risk factors for AD. Through our Specific Aims, we will (1) test the hypothesis that baseline macrovascular and microvascular biomarkers in middle-age predict both standard AD neuroimaging outcomes (e.g. hippocampal volume and amyloid deposition assessed with PET) and more novel cerebrovascular biomarkers (e.g. microinfarcts, lacunar infarcts, neurite density and cerebral microbleeds); (2) determine if changes in metabolic and vascular biomarkers over 15 years predict cognitive and AD biomarker trajectory; and (3) using high-dimensional machine learning approaches, determine common, differential and interactive metabolic and vascular risk factor profiles among racial and APOE genotype groups. This proposed ancillary study, approved by the MESA Steering Committee, is led by a New Investigator with an experienced, multi- disciplinary team of collaborators. The MESA study is an ideal cohort for interrogating the questions in this proposal: it has highly detailed longitudinal risk factor data collected over 15+ years in a diverse cohort, which we can leverage and augment with cerebrovascular biomarkers, AD biomarkers, and cognitive reassessments - thereby creating a comprehensive brain phenotype dataset for vascular and AD risk factors. These new data will enable us to examine the timing and impact of vascular biomarkers on dementia biomarkers and cognitive trajectories before a diagnosis of pre-clinical and clinical AD-related disorders, meeting a critical gap in information that will help guide the development of novel therapeutic or prevention strategies for various forms of AD-related dementias. Project Narrative Vascular and metabolic disorders are proposed as potent modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and may provide key routes for therapeutic and preventive interventions. We propose to leverage the vast resources of the NIH-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study to examine the potential contributions of macrovascular and microvascular subclinical disease to AD-related pathology. At the Wake Forest MESA site, we will add neuroimaging, repeated cognitive testing, and reprocessing of existing digital retinal scans with novel measures of retinal microvascular architecture.",The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD,9519805,R01AG054069,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Age-Years', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Ancillary Study', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modality', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurites', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Route', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vascular Diseases', 'adjudicate', 'age related', 'arterial stiffness', 'brain health', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcium', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'digital', 'epigenetic marker', 'experience', 'falls', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'macrovascular disease', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pre-clinical', 'resilience', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'symposium', 'vascular contributions', 'vascular factor', 'vascular risk factor']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,753400,0.22363353595597946
"Bioinformatics-predicted Alzheimer's risk factors and their role in synaptic dysfunction Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly that affects more than 5 million patients in the USA. Despite tremendous efforts to understand the pathophysiology of AD, no new therapeutic drug was approved in the last 10 years. A paradigm shift is needed in the approach to find effective treatment and cure of AD. Recent data demonstrate that synaptic failure is an essential cause of cognitive decline during the early phase of AD. Synapse loss in AD brain samples is the best correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment. The exact cellular process leading to such dramatic synapse loss in AD is still elusive. Technical advances allow now the detailed analysis of proteomics and mRNA sequencing and thus provide vast databases. Although multiple hits were described in genome wide association studies including novel genetic coding and non-coding regions, researchers are currently at the point they need to understand the molecular biology behind these genetic variations and how they impact AD. However, it is not clear how to best prioritize them for further study. This task is hindered by the fact that the physiological functions for the overwhelming majority of genes remain elusive as never tested in details. Here we propose a new innovative approach using bioinformatics, machine learning and synaptic functional assays to predict and analyze new pathways in the etiology of AD. Our iterative approach is based on prioritizing candidate genes that begins with previously validated software to predict AD-related phenotypes and is combined with a novel meta-analytic approach to predicting transcriptional changes with age. The candidate gene- phenotype list will be experimentally validated, and then this experimental data will in-turn be used to further refine the priority scores to be maximally sensitive to AD-related phenotypes. We expect that by combining transcriptional network behavior with literature-based relationships between genes, AD and AD-related phenotypes, we can determine the most likely phenotypic consequence of the identified variants linked to a specific gene. We also hypothesize that a subset of these variants encoding synaptic genes will cause synaptic dysfunction, which will be directly measured in cultured neurons and animal models of AD. We will test our hypothesis in two Specific Aims. The proposed research has the potential for significant impact as it will provide the AD field with a novel analytical tool to better predict risk factors and also will test for the first time genes or coding regions for their effect on synaptic transmission and AD pathology. Project Narrative  The proposed research addresses the pathomechanism of Alzheimer’s disease by combining bioinformatics to predict novel risk factors of this disease with detailed screening for their effects on neuronal communication. Understanding these novel pathways in the etiology of cognitive impairment has public health relevance as currently no effective therapy is available for dementia.

"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology. The completion of our study aims will advance the development of an affordable screening tool that can be utilized in a clinical/community setting to identify individuals who are candidates for comprehensive diagnostic testing.",Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology,9517639,R01AG054523,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrum', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cost Measures', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'glucose metabolism', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'ketogenic diet', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'minimally invasive', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'stem', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,759065,0.2503592496478446
"Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease The objective of the proposed Fast-Track SBIR effort is to develop and commercialize the Ryan CompanionBot (hereafter, Ryan), an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementia (ADRD). According to the NIA, research reports estimate that as many as 5.1 million Americans may have AD, and the number is expected to rise as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. Ryan will be designed to promote social interaction and foster engagement and rapport, and improve mood and well-being of persons with early stage AD/ADRD. In the Phase I effort, we will develop facial emotion recognition technology and integrate it with Ryan and then conduct a pilot study to understand the feasiblity and effectiveness of Ryan in fostering empathy and rapport in interaction with persons with AD/ADRD. Once validated, we will work with domain experts to design and build aestehcically pleasing Ryan V2.0 and integrate the facial expression recognition technology with a spoken- dialog system, reminders, and other intelligent features into Ryan to address the needs of persons with early stage AD/ADRD and their caregivers. If successful, DreamFace will be positioned to bring to market an affordable and effective socially-assistive robot to improve the quality of life for persons with AD/ADRD. The goal of the project is to develop a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease,9559291,R44AG059483,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Computer software', 'Cost of Illness', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Esthetics', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Face', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Measures', 'Memory Loss', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Saints', 'Serotonin', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Well in self', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'common symptom', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'geriatric depression', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'mental state', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'repetitive behavior', 'robot assistance', 'satisfaction', 'social', 'success', 'tau-1', 'tool']",NIA,"DREAM FACE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2018,241344,0.23315783450942718
"Construct large-scale phenomes of disease and drugs and develop data-driven systems approaches to understand genetic links between Alzheimer's disease and Neuropsychiatric symptoms PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and the most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting over 5.5 million people in United States and 47 million people worldwide. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in dementia and lead to great functional impairment, excess morbidity and mortality, and high social-economic costs in patients with AD. Currently, the genetic links between NPS and AD remains poorly characterized and there exist no effective treatments for AD and associated NPS. In this project titled “Construct large-scale phenomes of diseases and drugs and develop combined phenome- and genome-driven systems approaches to understand genetic links between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS)”, we will develop natural language processing (NLP), information extraction, knowledge representation and data integration techniques to construct a large-scale MindDiseasePhenome from 28 million biomedical articles. MindDiseasePhenome contains deep phenotypic relationships for tens of thousands of diseases, including AD and many neuropsychiatric diseases. MindDiseasePhenome is standardized using biomedical ontologies, fully annotated with biomedical literature, and extensively integrated with existing disease genetics and genomics data. We will develop NLP, information extraction, knowledge representation and data integration techniques to construct a large-scale MindDrugPhenome from 28 million biomedical articles, > 36,000 FDA drug labels, and 13 million health records. MindDrugPhenome contains side effect (SE)/phenotype information of over 8,580 drugs and 22,499 SEs (including 1,898 neurologic and 740 psychiatric SE terms). MindDrugPhenome is standardized, annotated and fully integrated with existing genetics data and biomedical ontologies. We will innovatively leverage MindDiseasePhenome and MindDrugPhenome and develop data-driven systems approach to understand genetic links between AD and NPS. We will develop interactive web applications to make all the data publicly available to the broad scientific community through AMP-AD Knowledge Portal. The unique and powerful strength of our project is our ability to seamlessly combine automatic construction of large-scale phenomes of diseases and drugs with novel data-driven systems approaches to understand genetic links between AD and NPS. Our research integrates multiple advanced computational technologies, including NLP, information extraction, knowledge representation and reasoning, data integration, network biology and data-driven genetics predictions. The unique MindDiseasePhenome and MindDrugPhenome will set the foundation to enable other computational approaches to understand the genetic links between AD and NPS. Our predicted novel genetic links between AD and NPS will enable biomedical researchers to conduct hypothesis- driven functional studies in experimental models of AD. Our project will likely lead to discovery of novel genetic links between AD and NPS with translational implications for the development of therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE !

"The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD The goal of this ongoing R01 is to chart the progression of pathobiologic markers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their effect on neural function and cognition in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with risk for AD. There is an appreciable gap in knowledge about the temporal disease course in this age range that this ongoing project has been directly addressing with serial multimodal imaging including amyloid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, and serial cognitive measurement. In the next funding cycle we will add a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique sensitive to fibrillar tau [F-18]THK5351 indexing neurofibrillary pathology. In the prior funding period we recruited 179 individuals from a registry of 1,545 people at risk for AD known as WRAP (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention). We found that [C-11]PIB amyloid burden is detectable in 20% of people with parental history of AD at a mean age of 60. Baseline amyloid is more extensive in the presence of higher CSF total tau levels, and 2-year increases in PiB amyloid are significantly predicted by higher baseline CSF tau. The hypothesis for this renewal is that tau- related neurofibrillar pathology begins early (in accord with the neuropathology literature) in people at AD risk and its strategic spatial burden explains changes in amyloid, neural function and cognitive decline. Aim 1: To test the premise that amyloid burden is necessary but not sufficient to evoke preclinical cognitive change. We will examine effects of longitudinal amyloid and tau change on episodic memory trajectories over time in 235 at risk individuals including all subjects we previously enrolled and follow them over 2 years with advanced multimodal imaging and CSF. Aim 2: To assess the effects of tau and amyloid imaging on MRI and CSF indicators of neural injury and function. Aim 3: To develop a multimodal disease marker to maximize efficiency of clinical trials in preclinical AD. Following our work in creating tools for efficient clinical trials in MCI, we will extend these concepts to the pre-MCI phase of disease utilizing deep learning architectures with tau, amyloid and structural imaging inputs. We will also examine change over time in tau, amyloid and cognition as outcomes. As any of these features considered singularly may be affected by age, and as amyloid and tau may be `necessary but not sufficient' by themselves, a derived multimodal marker may have eventual clinical utility in enriching prevention trials with those most likely to progress, and increasing power to detect change attributable to preclinical interventions. Significance: Relative tau and amyloid imaging profiles have not been empirically established in the presymptomatic time frame and this information is urgently needed to identify incipient disease. No comparable studies exist regarding the evolution of tau and amyloid signal in the critical late-middle-age time frame of preclinical AD. This ongoing project represents a unique opportunity to examine the earliest determinants of AD progression, when treatments may be most meaningful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/ NARRATIVE Identifying the earliest neuropathological features of AD including tau and amyloid pathology will improve early detection and inform clinical trials in the presymptomatic time frame. This project will examine these features with advanced imaging methods in a cohort at risk for AD who are largely asymptomatic.

"Functional Regression and Subgroup Analysis for Asynchronous Longitudinal Data. Project Summary / Abstract Asynchronous longitudinal designs have been widely used in studies on aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In these decades-long studies, as longitudinal variables were routinely collected from di erent platforms (e.g. food frequency questionnaires, lab results and clinical or psychological tests), the obtained data were not synchronized in time even for the same subject. As part of the motivating Normative Aging Study (NAS), it was of substantial interest to address whether dietary intake of niacin was associated with incident AD and cognitive decline. In the study, four cognitive tests were administered to participants in a span of 6 years after participation, and nutrient intake was determined by food frequency questionnaires distributed at the baseline and between adjacent cognitive tests. As a result, the exposure variables, including nutrient intake, and the outcomes of cognitive tests, were measured asynchronously. Naive analyses ignoring the mistiming issue will lead to biased results and wrong conclusion. In addition, the development of aging-associated diseases tends to di er in various (latent) subpopulations, where associations between disease progression and biomarkers and environmental exposures vary substantially across subpopulations. Subgroup analyses in aging populations are crucial for developing better strategies of preventing, treating and managing aging-associated diseases, such as AD.  Accounting for the peculiar nature of the NAS data, the proposed methods will help address the key question on the association between dietary intake of niacin and incident AD in the NAS. We will also examine other biomarkers and environmental exposures associated with AD. The proposed subgroup analysis will also help identify latent subgroups within the aging population and discern subgroup-speci c risk factors leading to cognitive impairment. Unlike the existing work relying on restrictive model assumptions, the proposed methods are fully nonparametric, data adaptive and can be combined with state-of-the-art model selection methods to choose relevant risk factors for AD from hundreds of variables that might be time varying and asynchronous with the response. Methods and theory developed in this project will be widely applicable to other longitudinal studies. We will also develop new computation tools and software packages that are scalable for large longitudinal data sets with long followups.

"Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease Abstract The exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes derived from brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by powerful computational tools has the potential of developing new knowledge, including the identification of pathways and targets that may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of the disease. The challenge is to find drugs that impact those pathways, and then validate the importance of those pathways – distinguishing primary disease drivers from secondary events. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to probe potential pathways in proof of concept, and ultimately therapeutic, clinical trials. Here, we propose to discover and validate hypotheses for drug repurposing in AD through three integrated, complementary informatics approaches. Specifically, we will apply classical and network aware (prior-loaded) machine learning approaches to identify pathways and targets altered in AD brains at different stages of disease progression using data from Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD available through Synapse (Aim 1); we will use systems pharmacology approaches to discover the target selectivity of lead compounds in human neuronal and glial cell types using unbiased RNA-seq, proteomic and imaging studies followed by pathway analysis (Aim 2). Each of these two Aims has two approaches: data-driven, hypothesis-generating analyses to discern disease-relevant drug signals; and hypothesis-testing in which positive findings from one approach are evaluated using the other approaches to assess rigor and reproducibility. Moreover, RNA-seq and proteomic data collected in cultured human CNS cell types following exposure to potential disease drivers and/or FDA-approved drugs in Aim 2 will be fed back into Aim 1 as CNS-cell type-derived priors to refine the predictive models. In Aim 3, we will develop new informatics strategies to conduct in-silico drug trials in EHR data with “prospective” outcomes to validate hypotheses based on the omics data sets and extant literature, using two big data sets: the UK 20 year CPRD longitudinal records of 20M National Health Service patients, and the RPDR Database (based at Partners Healthcare) with 6 M individuals followed for over 20 years. This integrated informatics program compensates for the limitations of each individual informatics approach to promote discovery and critical evaluation of “lead compounds” for known and novel AD pathways. To execute this strategy, we have assembled a multi-site, multi-disciplinary team with expertise ranging from clinical care to computer science and systems pharmacology. Some of the team members are AD experts and others bring an outsider's perspective. Finally, as a deliverable, we will create open-source data packages to release all the supporting evidence, software, and data with provenance in accordance with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) standards through Synapse and the AlzDataLens platform developed at MGH (Aim 4). These data packages will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies including collaborations with industry or members of the community at large involved in new clinical trials. Project Narrative Repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to accelerating proof-of-concept and ultimately therapeutic clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose a bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, using available expression data from AD brains in the public domain as our “laboratory” and electronic heath records(EHR) as our “clinical trial infrastructure”.

"The study partner requirement in preclinical Alzheimers disease trials Project Summary/Abstract Preclinical Alzheimer's disease clinical trials enroll cognitively normal participants who are willing to undergo disease biomarker testing, learn the results, and take an investigational drug (or placebo) if those results indicate that they are at increased risk for disease. Like traditional trials in Alzheimer's disease dementia, these trials require participants to enroll with a study partner, a person who can attend visits with the participant and report about any changes in the participant's cognitive or functional ability. Like traditional trials in Alzheimer's disease dementia, these trials face logistical challenges related to difficult recruitment. We recently showed that the requirement for a participant to learn their Alzheimer's disease biomarker status was not a barrier to successful recruitment. In contrast, the requirement of enrolling with a study partner was a significant barrier to participation for many potential enrollees. We also observed results that suggested that the study partner barrier was related to the requirement of biomarker testing and disclosure. This project will further investigate the study partner role in preclinical Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. First, we will explore the ethical implications of the study partner requirement, specifically whether this requirement is a barrier to enrollment because participants are unwilling to share their biomarker results with others. Second, we examine the scientific need for study partners, by measuring informants' accuracy and precision in assessing cognitive performance, predicting cognitive decline, and recognizing subtle changes in cognition, and comparing to participants' abilities to perform these roles themselves. These studies will provide valuable data toward improving preclinical AD trial protocol designs, assisting investigators making decisions around 1) whether to require study partners, 2) who is qualified to fill this role, and 3) how participants should be protected against potential stigma related to their eligibility. Project Narrative Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials enroll persons who have no observable cognitive impairment who demonstrate AD biomarkers and often face slow recruitment. This proposal will provide researchers with critical evidence to instruct recruitment that will increase the representativeness of preclinical AD trial subjects and ensure a complete understanding of the ethical issues in these trials, preventing a degradation of trust between researchers and participants and ensuring the safety of those who enroll.",The study partner requirement in preclinical Alzheimers disease trials,9564817,R21AG056931,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inferior', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Placebos', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'Visit', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'data integrity', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'eligible participant', 'improved', 'informant', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'social stigma', 'trial design', 'willingness']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2018,183868,0.12145255224150861
"Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the complexity of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis and the associated co-morbid conditions, both the “depth” and the “width” of currently available drug repurposing solutions need to be improved in order to deliver effective AD therapeutic solutions. The depth of a drug-repurposing project refers to the level of understanding of disease mechanism and drug-target interactions across a wide searching space for the combination of dosage and treatment time. Achieving depth requires a reliable AD model system that comprehensively recapitulates AD pathogenesis in a human brain-like environment, and sophisticated transcriptomic profiles, which can reveal molecular-level changes underlying disease-reversing phenotypes across multiple treatment conditions. The width of a therapy search relies on the efficacy of predicting and validating effects of candidate compounds from an enormous search space. Width can be achieved from novel computational algorithms connecting –omics changes with phenotypic changes, thus guiding the search with improved knowledge on mechanisms and avoiding exhaustive testing of every available drug. Integrating the systems medicine and drug repositioning expertise of the Wong Lab at the Houston Methodist Research Institute of Houston Methodist Hospital with the Alzheimer's biology expertise of the Kim and Tanzi labs at Massachusetts General Hospital, we propose a SysteMatic Alzheimer's disease drug ReposiTioning (SMART) framework based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening. Reformatting a novel three- dimensional human neural stem cell culture model of AD (a.k.a. Alzheimer's in a dish) developed in the Kim and Tanzi labs for high content screening, the Wong lab screened 2,640 known drugs and bioactive compounds and obtained a panel of 38 primary hits that strongly inhibit β-amyloid-driven p-tau accumulation. We hypothesize that iteratively running relatively small screens with our novel 3D cell model and applying systematic artificial intelligence modeling to the transcriptomic profiles of the screening hits will allow us to: 1) quickly obtain a panel of robust novel drug candidates for AD, and 2) gain an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms from those repositioned drug candidates, which will subsequently improve the success rate of predicting novel hits. Using the primary 38 hits as a starting point, the SMART computational modules will update the existing NeuriteIQ software package to quantify the image data from high content screening; it will also incorporate publicly available big data transcriptomic profiles to predict candidate compounds inducing similar pathway changes as those original compounds, effectively expanding the search width to tens of thousands of compounds while only requiring functional validation of less than 100 drug candidates. The validated predictions will, in turn, add to the panel of known hits that will launch the next round of computational predictions and experimental validations, efficiently generating candidates for novel AD therapies (Aim 1). SMART's iterative prediction-validation scheme effectively connects more transcriptomic profiles to desirable phenotypic changes. Thus, we will apply systematic image-omics modeling to uncover novel mechanisms driving such phenotypes. For all the validated hits, dose-responses for the phenotype of pTau inhibition will be obtained using the 3D culture model; while the dose-responses for individual genes and pathways will be modeled through public and in-house generated transcriptomic profiles. We will use Partial Least Square Regression models to identify gene modules with matching dose-response curves as the phenotypes, thus allowing us to go beyond the confinement of canonical pathway maps and identify novel functional modules specifically related to phenotypes of interest (Aim 2). Selected compounds derived from the previous two aims will be evaluated in human neurons directly derived from AD patients and in animal models (Aim 3). Success of this work will lead to new AD therapeutic compounds ready for translation into clinical trials, as well as a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the SMART framework for drug repositioning will be generalizable to other big data and disease platforms. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) currently afflicts 5.3 million people in the United States alone. Beyond symptomatic treatments, no clear therapeutic options are available. The proposed study provides a systematic drug repositioning strategy that uses a novel 3D human neural culture model (Alzheimer's-in-a-dish) integrated with a computational platform that leverages publicly available toxicology and pharmokinetic big data. Success of the study will greatly reduce the cost of AD drug development, identify potential new disease mechanism, and facilitate quicker translation from bench to bedside. .",Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics,9606670,R01AG057635,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Methodist Church', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Institute', 'Running', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Width', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cost', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'exhaustion', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'individual response', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symptom treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tau-1', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,694058,0.13085335160728429
"An Integrated Reverse Engineering Approach Toward Rapid drug Re positioning for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and one of the leading sources of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. Despite enormous social and economic costs associated with AD, current drugs are directed towards symptomatic relief and none are curative. In this project titled “An integrated reverse engineering approach toward rapid drug repositioning for Alzheimer’s disease,” we propose to develop an innovative integrated drug repositioning strategy that combines computation-based drug prediction, computation-based human brain-blood-barrier (BBB) permeability prediction, retrospective large-scale clinical corroboration, and prospective experimental testing to rapidly identify anti-AD drug candidates. First, we will develop novel computational approaches to identify repositioning anti-AD candidates from all (>2,600) FDA-approved drugs. Second, we will develop novel multifaceted biology-based computational methods to predict which repositioned drug candidates can cross BBB in humans. Third, we will perform large-scale retrospective case-control studies to corroborate the clinical efficacy of repositioned drug candidates using patient electronic health record (EHR) data of >50 million patients. Finally, we will evaluate the therapeutic potential of promising repositioned candidates in experimental models. Our study will generate a large amount of data/knowledge/hypotheses that could serve as a starting point for us and others to conduct hypothesis-driven drug repositioning studies in other animal models of AD and in AD patients. We will build a comprehensive Alzheimer Drug Repositioning Knowledge Base (ADRKB) and develop interactive web applications to make ADRKB publicly available. The unique and powerful strength of our project is our ability to seamlessly combine novel computational predictions, retrospective clinical corroboration using patient EHRs, and experimental testing in animal models of AD to rapidly identify innovative drug candidates that may work in real-world AD patients. The repositioned drug candidates will have interpretable mechanisms of action, are highly likely to cross BBB in humans, have clinical effectiveness evidence gathered from ‘real-world’ AD patients, and have demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of AD. We anticipate that these findings can be expeditiously translated into clinical trials and benefit 5.4 million AD patients in United States and 47 million AD patients worldwide. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes enormous personal and societal burdens. Currently there exist no cures for AD.

The output of our project will be a list of ranked repositioned drug candidates with interpretable mechanisms of action, high BBB permeability in humans, supporting clinical efficacy evidence gathered from ‘real-world’ AD patients, and demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of AD.

"MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a leading cause of disability and death in the US and major global public health problem due to rise in aging population resulting in untold suffering, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies is certain. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Our application is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing to leverage an innovative molecular imaging platform invented at Stanford, multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI). We will determine the high dimensional cellular and subcellular protein-level expression, interaction, and localization for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomic and proteomic studies in resilience and pathologic states using human brain sections from an ongoing proteomic investigation of AD. We hypothesize that in-depth, stage-specific phenotypic signatures extracted from these unique groups will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. We will test our hypothesis through three Specific Aims: (1) Establish a subcellular, phenotypic framework of vulnerable and resistant brain areas. Next-generation MIBI equipment will be used to rigorously image 30+ proteins simultaneously; targets marking subtypes of neurons, synapses, non-neuronal cells, neuro-inflammatory, and vascular components will be concurrently measured. (2) Reveal cognitive resilience multiplexed phenotypes. Using approaches we have successfully applied in other single cell studies, we will analyze multiplexed imaging data with statistical deep learning methods already established in our lab to identify topological, cellular, and molecular phenotypic differences among resilient, co- morbid, and AD dementia. (3) Implement a shared data repository. The power of multiplexed imaging in biology is its ability to reveal co-localization or mutual exclusivity to infer regulatory roles and gain mechanistic insight. To disseminate hundreds of these images from our proposed highly multiplexed study, we will create a web-based portal, using already established infrastructure, where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi-color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features will be shared freely. PROJECT NARRATIVE AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the aging American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. Such signatures will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. Such insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets, as well as create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD.",MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease,9565386,R01AG057915,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Electrons', 'Equipment', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lobule', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'abeta accumulation', 'aging population', 'collaborative approach', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'disease-causing mutation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'nanometer resolution', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'presenilin', 'presenilin-1', 'presenilin-2', 'resilience', 'response to injury', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tissue resource']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,905050,0.18604110527696535
"Phenotypic screening and computational modeling for development of combination therapies for Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is thought to affect 40 million patients worldwide, a likely underestimate given the increasing recognition that the disease begins in the brain 2-3 decades before clinical symptoms are manifest. With an aging population and the staggering economic and emotional burden of patient care, the demand for effective AD therapies continues to grow. Beta amyloid (Aβ) peptides are thought to be the initial trigger for neurotoxic sequelae that in turn define AD progression; however, the recent clinical failures of a number of investigational drugs aimed at either preventing the production and/or aggregation of Aβ or enhancing its clearance have highlighted the need to gain a more holistic understanding of the temporal and spatial complexity intrinsic to AD pathophysiology. The pleiotropic effects attributed to Aβ are a challenge for developing pharmaceutical interventions against neuronal toxicity in AD. In this project, we propose merging phenotypic screening with computational inference to deconstruct Aβ-induced toxicities into targetable and interacting pathogenic and protective pathways. Our approach iterates experiments with computational modeling and analysis to efficiently identify drug combinations that protect against Aβ-induced toxicity in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived AD cell models. We have two specific aims: The first aim is to identify FDA approved drugs that prevent death in iPSC-derived neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) treated with Aβ, and then find combinations of these drugs that will synergistically combine to protect cells. Our second aim is to find combinations of approved drugs that target different pathways involved in Aβ-mediated cell death; here, the drugs considered need not individually demonstrate measurable protection against Aβ cell death, but we will computationally identify combinations that provide protection. In both aims, hits will be found through cell-based phenotypic screening, and combinations will be predicted using orthogonal computational models, including existing models, novel methods that incorporate drug-target interaction information, and deep learning. We design our study to simultaneously minimize the number of screens required to identify effective combinations, maximize the efficacy of the optimal combinations, and maximize the gain in information about the cellular effects of Aβ. This project will not only generate novel combinations of FDA approved drugs that slow Aβ-related cell death in human NPCs, but it will also deepen our understanding of the systems biology of AD pathogenesis, opening the door for development of new therapeutic strategies. At the end of the project, we expect to have several combinations of approved drugs poised for in vivo or clinical testing, as well as a list of pathways that are central to protection of neuronal cells in AD. Project Narrative The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasing with an aging population, mounting a staggering economic and emotional burden of patient care, and driving the demand for effective AD therapies. This project combines computational modeling with cell-based phenotypic screening to identify approved drugs or combinations of approved drugs for protecting human neuronal cells against cell death downstream of oligomeric beta amyloid insult. The expected outcome is a set of combinations treatments that show neuroprotection in vitro and can readily be advanced to pre-clinical or clinical trials.",Phenotypic screening and computational modeling for development of combination therapies for Alzheimer's disease,9783087,R56AG059612,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytoprotection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Titrations', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'abeta accumulation', 'abeta toxicity', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'design', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'model development', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuron loss', 'neuroprotection', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'pleiotropism', 'preclinical trial', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'receptor', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'synergism']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,782279,0.14353168093693444
"CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder. Inflammatory changes in the brain are thought to represent key processes in the onset and progression of AD, but it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation confers neuroprotection, accelerated degeneration, or possibly both. Such an understanding in living humans is critical if we are to begin clinical trials using the array of FDA-approved immunomodulatory drugs in the future. We propose that complement- mediated neuroinflammation is protective in the early AD stages, while suppression of complement activities is accompanied by the development of greater cognitive deficits and faster cognitive decline. Our preliminary data from multiple cohorts support this hypothesis by showing 1) reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement-related markers occur in the dementia stage but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD; 2) reduced CSF complement-related markers and elevated CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with faster decline in AD; and 3) CSF inflammatory protein alterations reveal networks of cellular and protein regulations. In the In the current application, we will build on the association between complement related proteins and rates of cognitive decline in AD to identify associated changes in soluble CSF cytokines and chemokines, differential inflammatory cell type regulation, and imaging correlates of neuroinflammation. This application takes advantage of our group’s strengths in performing CSF cytokine measurements, CSF immunophenotyping, molecular imaging of neuroinflammation through positron emission tomography (PET) and iron-enhanced MRI, and network analysis through a novel biochemical-bioinformatics pipeline. We will directly identify individual and networks of soluble CSF cytokines that accompany the transition from the MCI to the dementia stage of AD, correlate the complement and other altered pathways with microglial activation through two modern PET tracers (11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA), and measure changes in individual T helper cell (type 1, 2, 17) and non-T cell populations. This application represents the first attempt to correlate, at the individual level and at the group level, CSF and imaging measures of neuroinflammation. If successful, this application will advance the understanding of neuroinflammation in AD through parallel approaches, form the basis of a new biomarker panel (and algorithm) to diagnose AD through a combination of degenerative and inflammatory markers, and accelerate the target identification of future therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system in AD. Brain inflammation is a key event in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but it is not clear whether it is harmful, protective, or both. The current proposal aims to confirm our finding that a switch from the protective to harmful type of inflammation predicts more severe symptoms and faster progression in Alzheimer’s disease, and we can identify people with the protective and harmful inflammation by studying the cerebrospinal fluid (circulating proteins and cells) and brain imaging (PET and MRI scans).","CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease",9511731,R01AG054046,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement Suppression', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Encephalitis', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fractalkine', 'Future', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune system', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-7', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Phagocytes', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'biomarker panel', 'brain dysfunction', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'demographics', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'immunomodulatory drugs', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'iron oxide', 'macrophage', 'migration', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'neuroprotection', 'novel']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,748911,0.20402257234873727
"Manifold-valued statistical models for longitudinal morphometic analysis in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) Project Summary The ability to quantitatively characterize incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in its preclinical stage is a critical step for early interventions involving disease modifying therapy and for designing efficient clinical trials to test therapy efficacy. This project focuses on deriving statistical image analysis methods for identifying the relationship of morphometric changes in this early stage with direct indicators of AD pathology (such as amyloid deposition) and various risk factors such as family history in late midlife adults who are cognitively healthy. The proposed analysis will be conducted on the largest preclinical AD cohort assembled to date and help elucidate how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals at risk for AD. The core of our analyses is a set of algorithms that allow operating directly on powerful “manifold-valued” representations of morphometric change and consequently yield high sensitivity in picking up real but statistically weak multi-modal patterns of the disease process. Hypothesis: 1) Detecting precise associations between morphometric changes in preclinical AD subjects with amyloid burden and various risk factors is possible using new algorithms that work directly with representations of the Jacobians of the deformation fields derived from longitudinal imaging data. 2) Conducting such analyses on a large multi-site cohort of asymptomatic at-risk preclinical AD individuals with identified AD pathology will a) reveal important insights into early disease processes when dementia is 15+ years away, b) provide preclinical AD biomarkers and c) provide frameworks for predicting clinical endpoints at the level of individual subjects. Specific Aims: 1) To develop new algorithms for performing statistical analysis of manifold representations of morphometric changes concurrently with multiple covariates representing risk factors, AD pathology markers, and clinical/cognitive measures. 2) Conducting an end-to-end analysis of two independent preclinical AD cohorts to identify the relationship of morphometric changes with various predictors as well as test/retest validation across sites. 3) Analyzing the largest preclinical AD cohort to date for characterizing the relationship of the entire spectrum of predictors to clinical endpoints for late midlife individuals. 4) Providing industry- strength open-source software implementing the full suite of models, integrated with existing software toolboxes, for deployments on a workstation, a high throughput cluster or the cloud. Significance: This project will have a significant impact across three distinct areas of brain imaging research: 1) characterization of how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals in the earliest stages of AD, 2) rigorous algorithms for morphometric change analysis in neuroimaging and neuroscience, 3) open-source end-to-end implementations of the algorithms for use within the community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project will develop novel statistical image analysis methods to characterize complex morphological brain changes in healthy individuals who are at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also have some evidence of AD related pathology. Studying and quantifying the evolution of early disease processes in late midlife adults (who are cognitively healthy) on the largest “preclinical” AD cohorts assembled to date will yield frameworks that tie such disease patterns to precise clinical endpoints, such as cognitive decline. These preclinical AD biomarkers have direct applications in a) design of clinical trials for new therapies and b) eventual translation to clinical practice.",Manifold-valued statistical models for longitudinal morphometic analysis in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD),9542329,R01EB022883,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'design', 'direct application', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'pre-clinical', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tau Proteins', 'therapy design', 'user friendly software', 'web interface']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,331530,0.2757801065433754
"A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials PROJECT SUMMARY It is our hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous conditions and, therefore, a paradigm shift is required to identify specific subpopulations for targeted interventions. This approach has generated significant success in other complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. A key opportunity in this context is the identification of those most likely to benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs and other anti-inflammatory compounds. The relation between inflammation and the development of AD, MCI, and cognitive decline has received a great deal of attention with basic science and observational human studies demonstrating a protective effect against cognitive loss. Likewise, in our work, inflammation has been a key mechanism in the biological profile that is indicative of disease presence. Based on a wealth of literature (epidemiological, cross-sectional, pathobiological and animal model), multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the utility of NSAID compounds in treating or preventing AD (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study [ADCS] AD and MCI anti-inflammatory trials; Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial [ADAPT]); however, each of these studies failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit, in fact some patients may have exhibited worsening cognitive performance with treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that particular subsets of patients in these trials did benefit from treatment and that our blood-based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify both positive and adverse responders within these trials. Here we propose to leverage three previously conducted clinical trials to test our hypothesis that our blood- based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify the subsets of patients who benefited from these previously conducted clinical trials. By conducting proteomic assays from existing biorepositories from the ADCS and ADAPT, we will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate the utility of the proinflammatory endophenotype as a means for patient selection into NSAID therapy for treating and preventing AD; Specific Aim 2. To determine if change in proinflammatory endophenotype scores over time is a biomarker of therapeutic response. By leveraging a highly innovative method and substantial existing resources, the current project addresses a significant need in the search for novel approaches AD therapeutics. The significance of the current project is the identification of a specific subset of patients who will experience clinically significant cognitive benefit from administration of NSAID medication. If successful, the current project will set the stage for a novel clinical trial that enrolls patients specifically based on baseline proinflammatory endophenotype scores for administration of NSAID therapy. In the long-term, this line of research is designed to build a person-centered (i.e. personalized) approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's diseases are a growing public health crisis impacting millions of elders world-wide with a health care cost greater than cancer and equivalent to cardiovascular disease. Current treatments only slow progression of the disease and new strategies are urgently needed. The relevance of the current project is the validation of a person-centered approach to treating Alzheimer's disease by identifying specific subgroups that are most likely to respond to targeted therapies.

"Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been identified as one of the strongest genetic determinants of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In general, the e4 allele is associated with reductions in neural protection and repair, increasing a carrier’s vulnerability to damage accumulated over his/her lifetime. Nevertheless, while the penetrance of ApoE e4 is relatively high, a significant proportion of e4 carriers will never develop AD. The overall goal of this project is to model interactions across multiple omics networks to identify the biological pathways involved in sporadic AD susceptibility versus resilience among high-risk individuals. The multifactorial nature of AD suggests that it may manifest as a result of complex interactions across the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Identifying the central networks involved in AD pathogenesis will require integrative Systems Biology approaches. The proposed research offers a new and innovative way to integrate networks—a dominant feature in biology—across multiple tissues and omics platforms, in order to identify innate and dynamic precursors of resilience to AD, among a high-risk population (e4+). Towards this goal, we will: (1) employ newly developed GWAS-based network analysis, to identify SNP networks that alter the association between ApoE e4 and cognitive decline/dementia; (2) generate DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from brain samples that we will analyze using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (3) generate proteomic data from brain and CSF samples that we will analyze using WGCNA to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (4) use advanced integromic network analysis to identify multi-omics and multi-tissue pathways and biological systems involved in AD resilience. The integration of multiple 'omics' data using systems biology will be crucial for unraveling the connections and interactions between various functional levels involved in complex diseases, such as AD. Overall, our proposed research will improve understanding of the complex biology underlying AD susceptibility. These studies have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets that could inform the development of future pharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing or slowing AD pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with the ApoE e4 genotype have a substantially increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this project is identify underlying biological interactions and networks that explain why some e4 carriers do not develop Alzheimer's disease, despite being high-risk. This research has the potential to uncover novel targets that can lead to the development of effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers,9566974,R01AG057912,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'biological systems', 'computer based statistical methods', 'effective therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multiple omics', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'resilience', 'screening', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,1158157,0.238501232457794
"Assessing cellular aging in old and rejuvenated neurons from Alzheimer patients SUMMARY  Dr. Jerome Mertens is a stem cell biologist specialized in modeling human neurodegenerative diseases. During his graduate studies under the supervision of Dr. O. Brüstle (University of Bonn), Jerome was extensively trained in human stem cell and reprogramming technologies, and cellular neuroscience, and he published three first-author papers on utilizing human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to model Alzheimer's Disease (AD). As a postdoctoral researcher at the Salk Institute under the supervision of Dr. F.H. Gage, Dr. Mertens acquired an exceptional foundation in functional neuroscience, nuclear pore biology and imaging. Being entirely dedicated to advancing human in vitro disease models, Dr. Mertens' research focus was to better understand complex human brain disorders and the process of neuronal aging. He could show that direct conversion of human fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs) preserves signatures of cell aging, while iPSC reprogramming erases them. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Mertens thus far first-authored three primary research studies in Nature, Cell Stem Cell and Molecular Psychiatry. As an independent scientist, Dr. Mertens seeks bringing together his recent findings on modeling neuronal aging, his permanent interest in AD, and powerful systems biology and bioinformatic technologies to unravel the earliest age-dependent and disease- initiating mechanisms of sporadic AD. In his Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) proposal, Dr. Mertens, together with his Mentor Dr. F.H. Gage, and his Co-Mentors Dr. D. Galasko, Dr. M.W. Hetzer and Dr. G. Yeo, designed a dedicated training plan in systems biology and bioinformatics, and proposes a research project that sets out to reveal the impact of cellular aging in a human model for AD. In the first aim (K99 phase) Dr. Mertens will generate both phenotypically old and rejuvenated neurons from a large set of clinically well- characterized AD patients and matched controls to better understand the impact of neuronal aging on the pathology of sporadic AD. Following an unbiased transcriptome approach, he will analyze for AD-specific gene expression profiles and work to understand which of the AD-specific gene expression signatures and related mechanisms are age-dependent and which are age-independent. In a second aim (K99/R00 phases), Dr. Mertens will study the age-related dysregulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and the import receptor RanBP17, which currently emerge as major topics in aging and neurodegenerative disease research. He will measure nucleo-cytoplasmic compartmentalization in young and old AD neurons and probe for nuclear transport-based mediators of age-dependent AD pathology using live cell imaging approaches. In a third aim (R00 phase), he will generate and analyze iNs from a large set of individuals suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and pre-symptomatic middle-aged donors, in addition to clinical AD patients. His goal is to find a trajectory in the transcriptomic AD motifs to pinpoint the earliest and potentially most treatable mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis, and to develop a biomarker for the detection of pre-disease AD.   NARRATIVE  The project by Dr. Mertens aims at deciphering the molecular and cell biological impact of human aging on Alzheimer's disease patient-specific induced neurons (iNs) and their rejuvenated counterparts (iPSC-iNs). Dr. Mertens will employ unbiased transcriptome approaches to analyze a clinically well-defined cohort of AD patient and control samples, and further extend the study to iNs from pre-AD (MCI) patients to find the earliest and most causative pathological mechanisms of the disease.

"Leveraging the Human Non-Coding Transcriptome to Identify Therapeutics for Healthy Aging and Alzheimers Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Age is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Nevertheless, a majority of individuals do not develop AD by their 9th decade of life. We propose that targeting the endogenous protective mechanisms associated with ‘healthy aging’ represents a sound scientific paradigm for addressing AD prevention, especially if this can be achieved using a combination of pre-existing FDA approved drugs. Our initial models of human aging identified novel transcriptomic signatures of aging, common in human hippocampus and muscle, prompting us to develop an expanded biobank and an updated assay that integrates both protein coding and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) data using novel RNA quantification methods, and extensively phenotyped clinical resources. We have utilized this translational bioinformatics strategy and a novel human biobank to produce a robust prototype screen that successfully identified >100 drugs from in silico analysis using the NIH cMAP/LINCS database, including 29 chemical regulators of a proven longevity pathway (PI3K/mTOR, p<0.00001). We validated this activity in human primary cells. Here, our overarching goal is to refine this screen in a range of human cell models and identify optimal combinations of FDA approved drugs that positively regulate the healthy-aging-related RNA network without the focused need for direct PI3K/mTOR inhibition and hence reduced potential side effects. Through the pursuit of 3 major distinct but interacting aims, the present body of work will enhance the network modeling by incorporating human brain aging lncRNA responses; formatting the current validated assay into a higher-throughput screen able to examine ~5,000-10,000 combinations of individually active drugs. We expect to demonstrate that our strategy can guide repositioning of individual drugs into sets of drug-combinations that ‘switch on’ a healthy-aging profile in human cell systems. NARRATIVE The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is age, and up to 10% of the population develops AD by the age of 65. Since over 1.2 billion people are set to reach 65yr world-wide in the coming two decades, the imminent socioeconomic costs mean that it is extremely urgent to identify practical solutions. We have discovered a healthy-aging molecular signature that is ‘druggable’; and have devised a high-throughput strategy to identify combinations of efficacious FDA-approved drugs that induce that signature. Unlike standard drug-development that is too slow, the present project aims to quickly select ideal drug combinations that might delay or prevent AD and motivate new clinical trials.",Leveraging the Human Non-Coding Transcriptome to Identify Therapeutics for Healthy Aging and Alzheimers Disease,9783083,R56AG061911,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Aerobic', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Europe', 'Exons', 'FDA approved', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longevity Pathway', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Titrations', 'Transcript', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug standard', 'epigenomics', 'healthy aging', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human model', 'mTOR inhibition', 'mitochondrial autophagy', 'molecular modeling', 'network models', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'resilience', 'response', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'tau phosphorylation', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R56,2018,749747,0.07336656562774008
"Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome Abstract By age 40 years, individuals with Down syndrome (DS) show the neuropathological changes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and have a high risk for dementia, but little is known about the biomarkers that may predict clinical onset or reflect disease progression. The ABC-DS study focuses on a longitudinal and multidisciplinary determination of key biomarkers that are likely to define this progression, including levels and rates of change in blood based biomarkers such as b-amyloid peptides, protein and lipid profiles, and measures of amyloid and tau concentration in cerebrospinal fluid, neuroimaging-based changes and genetic polymorphisms. Using a neurocognitive battery that we have developed and tested, systematic profiles of longitudinal stability and of decline will allow us to define dementia status, including Mild Cognitive Impairment in DS (MCI-DS), and characterize progression in clinical status. Previously generated protein, inflammatory and lipid signatures will be examined, as well as amyloid and tau profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Imaging biomarkers will include structural MRI components and PET studies of brain amyloid uptake and tau protein. Analysis of MRI imaging biomarkers will include longitudinal measures of atrophy, white matter abnormalities and intrinsic network connectivity paradigms. Amyloid positron tomography will delineate regional and whole brain uptake of amyloid and tau deposition. Polymorphisms in candidate genes for AD and related biomarkers will be studied as potential modifiers of risk and their relation to beta amyloid, proteomic, lipidomic and imaging biomarkers examined. Relationships among demographic, clinical, blood based and CSF biomarkers, imaging measures, and genetic variants will be examined to develop the most valid indicators of preclinical and early stages of AD. The addition of non-targeted proteomics (n=7,000 proteins) will provide the single largest and richest dataset to date for the study of AD in adults with DS The identification of a blood-based profile that can be highly accurate in identifying people at risk and in screening out people who have a low likelihood of having cerebral amyloid and/or tau would be of tremendous value to novel clinical trials an approach has tremendous potential for revolutionizing the current system. Importantly, the data and the biological samples will be archived and banked to establish a resource to be shared with other scientists. Collectively, our investigators have a combined clinical and research experience involving over 1500 patients (30% demented), over 850 banked blood samples, 500 DNA samples, and 50 imaging studies. Further, team investigators have previous experience with all methods that will be included in this new project. This proposal brings together a group of co-investigator with established expertise in studies of DS and makes available a combined cohort of 400 participants. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Individuals with Down syndrome have a high risk for Alzheimer's disease, but little is known about the biomarkers that characterize disease onset and progression or why some individuals develop dementia much earlier than others. This study focuses on a multidisciplinary determination of key risk as well as protective biomarkers that are likely to affect AD progression, including blood-based, CSF-based and imaging-based biomarkers, and polymorphisms in AD-related genes. Study of biomarkers for early dementia changes may yield critical data documenting the transition from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment to clinical dementia in individuals with DS. This can provide key insights into the pathways involved in AD progression and may allow for future therapeutic interventions before irreversible cognitive deterioration has occurred.",Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome,9754500,U01AG051412,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Archives', 'Atrophic', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrum', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Core Facility', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Deterioration', 'Disease Progression', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'amyloid pathology', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'demented', 'early detection biomarkers', 'experience', 'forest', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'human model', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'rate of change', 'screening', 'tau Proteins', 'tomography', 'tool', 'uptake', 'validation studies', 'white matter']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2018,338385,0.14306069004912203
"Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a prospective, community-based 3-generational study that enrolled participants between ages 20-50 and has examined them every 2-4 years to collect extensive lifestyle, vascular, biomarker data; 9300 have GWAS. Embedded in this cohort are 1036 multigenerational families. Surveillance for AD dementia (and MCI) has been ongoing for over 4 decades. We have identified 1421 incident AD, 1767 MCI, enrolled 800+ in a brain donation program, obtained 7000+ 1.5T brain MRI, and repeated, detailed neuropsychological assessments. We have recently obtained extensive omics in ~6000 (gene expression, methylation, miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics) and genomics (50X whole genome sequences [WGS] in 4197 with pedigree-based imputation to 6554) through the NHLBI funded SABRe CVD (omics) and TOPMed (WGS) programs. We seek to leverage these rich resources (>$25 million). We propose these specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain temporal trends in clinical AD dementia in the FHS cohorts. The age-specific incidence of dementia has declined over the past 4 decades among FHS participants (in press). However, the reasons for this decline remain unclear. We thus propose to continue tracking temporal trends in AD dementia and MCI through intensive surveillance, and verifying diagnoses at autopsy. We hypothesize that better education, treatment of some vascular factors and protective lifestyle changes (diet, activity, social engagement) may partially explain these trends. AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention. Whereas the total number of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages, we have 4 decades of Framingham data suggesting that the risk at any given age is declining. We plan to study the reasons for this hopeful trend in detail through continuing our surveillance for dementia and cognitive impairment, collecting cutting edge brain imaging (amyloid and tau-PET, volumes, connectivity and perfusion on MRI) in the dementia-free (preclinical AD), and using sophisticated analysis of very extensive genetic and omic data already collected on Framingham subjects. This could help us better understand AD trends and biology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.   ","Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts",9682190,R01AG054076,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug Targeting', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Social Network', 'Spin Labels', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time trend', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'base', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genome wide association study', 'good diet', 'grandparent', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'personalized risk prediction', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'social engagement', 'targeted biomarker', 'tau Proteins', 'tractography', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend', 'vascular factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2018,2639239,0.26700957105653655
"Alzheimer's Disease Radio-Pathomics ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and common cause of dementia in elderly individuals. The loss of memory, inability to learn, decreased language function, among other neurological deficits, affects social functioning, and are catastrophic to maintaining daily life. The progression of AD eventually causes death within 5-10 years, and during this time the burden of patient care falls on an already stressed healthcare system. In 2017, it is estimated that AD cost the US $259 billion and by 2050 estimates could be as much as $1.1 trillion.  The main focus of our ongoing R01CA218144 project is to map the intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneities of glioblastoma brain tumors at molecular, cellular, and tissue scales using whole brain samples aligned to clinical MRI scans. This supplement, in response to NOT-AG-18-008, looks to extend this technology into the diagnosis and treatment of AD.  Central Hypothesis: Microscopic cytological features of Alzheimer’s disease are detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging.  Rationale: To date, Radiological-Pathological (Rad-Path) imaging studies of AD have been extremely limited due to the difficulty in recruiting patients for both imaging and brain donation. The departments of radiology and pathology at the Medical College of Wisconsin have an ongoing brain donation program for patients with glioblastoma that enables us to correlate imaging findings to the underlying pathology using whole brain tissue samples. This extensive tissue and imaging bank has been used to validate imaging technology by combining complementary radiographic and pathological information. This growing one-of-a-kind dataset will be extended to include the recruitment of patients with AD participating in the Alzheimer’s Connectome Project.  Our preliminary results from our ongoing brain cancer studies suggest that hidden untapped information within the macroscopic imaging can be used to predict the presence of invasive tumor. Completion of these aims may establish an additional imaging biomarker for predicting AD pathology, and as efforts move forward to personalize treatment, this information will be invaluable in the clinical setting. !

"MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but has no effective prevention or treatment. The brain proteome, ascertained in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have proven to be a rich source of information, reflecting Aβ plaques deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal injury and inflammation, and have helped the enrollment of participants in clinical trials. Still, additional non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers are critical for the early detection, disease intervention and monitoring. Novel biomarkers may also help identify and characterize the additional aspects of AD, such as rate of progression and age at onset. Although genetic studies have focused on the identification of variants associated with risk through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome and exome sequencing projects, the genetic factors modulating these additional aspects of AD are less investigated. The current proposal focuses on these understudied aspects of disease etiology, namely the role of common and rare genetic variation on quantitative diagnostic and prognostic endophenotypes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will develop a unique resource – the proteome ascertained in a plasma, CSF and brain for a large number of samples – that will allow us to leverage unbiased approaches to reveal novel biomarkers and endophenotypes associated with AD and complex traits. We will utilize Mendelian Randomization to identify causal proteins involved in AD and extend our studies to other complex traits. We will use GWAS, exome-chip, whole-exome and whole-genome sequences to identify single variants, genes and pathways associated with plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain protein levels of AD biomarkers. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with devastating personal, familial, societal and economical burdens, and there is currently no effective means of prevention or treatment. If successful, our research will reveal novel intermediate traits and genetic variants involved in AD and other complex traits, potentially leading to prospective therapeutic targets, and will also provide guidelines for accurate and practical assessments of AD status, which will be invaluable for evaluations of effectiveness of experimental treatments in clinical trials.",MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS,9543145,R01AG057777,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'TREM2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical risk', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'protein profiling', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,753419,0.2385986579292694
"Center for Identification and Study of Individuals with Atypical Diabetes Mellitus (U54) Diabetes is traditionally classified in two broad categories: autoimmune Type 1 and obesity-related Type 2. Numerous phenotypically and etiologically distinct forms exist and are emerging, collectively termed “atypical diabetes” (AD), that do not fit into either category. We hypothesize that AD comprises a spectrum that includes numerous forms, both known (e.g, MODY/monogenic, Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults, Ketosis-Prone Diabetes) and unknown. We propose to establish the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE). The goals of CADRE are to (1) identify and define comprehensively the forms of AD; and (2) establish an extensive database and repository of biosamples from AD patients. Defining the forms of AD is challenging because the etiology of AD can range from a single gene variant to a highly complex mixture of genetics, epigenetics and environmental factors. To identify patients with AD, and then to define the forms, we will use a two-pronged approach. Approach (a) will use clustering analysis of genotypic and phenotypic data from diverse groups of patients with diabetes. We have recruited 15 domestic and international population cohorts with data on more than 33,000 patients with diabetes. Further, we have recruited six diabetes study clinics (Baylor College of Medicine [BCM], University of Washington [UW], Indiana University [IU], Emory University, University of Colorado, and SUNY Downstate) who will prospectively recruit patients. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation will facilitate recruitment from patient groups. The Administrative Core at BCM will work with cohorts and clinics to obtain data. The University of South Florida (USF) will filter data for AD and separate patients into phenotypically homogenous clusters that can be diagnosed based on genetic and clinical features unique to the cluster. Approach (b) will identify monogenic, oligogenic and mitochondrial forms of AD from patients enrolled in genetics registries (BCM) and a family study with genetic data (Botnia). The BCM registries include patients referred to the Undiagnosed Disease Network. All patients will undergo whole-exome and mitochondrial genome sequencing (Cores at BCM), single-nucleotide polymorphism variant analysis (Oxford), metabolomic analysis (Duke) and phenotypic analysis of C-peptide, adiponectin, proinsulin, islet autoantibodies, and serum insulin DNA levels (Cores at UW and IU). To establish the database and biorepository, we will invite patients with AD to participate in sample donation and longitudinal follow-up via the cohorts and clinics. Data and samples will be transferred to the Database and Biorepository Core at USF, with input and tracking implemented using the successful framework developed by USF for large multicenter trials. Data will be made available through the NIDDK and a CADRE website and samples will be made available through ancillary study application. Ongoing patient recruitment to expand the database and biorepository will occur through the study clinics and clinician referral through the CADRE website. Overall, CADRE will be built on a foundation of existing, successful core facilities and computational systems to create a lasting resource that will substantially advance AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE For many people with diabetes, their symptoms do not match those usually associated with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We will use medical and genetic information from a large number of patients with diabetes to find all the forms of “atypical diabetes,” so doctors can better diagnose and treat these patients. We will also make the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE) to keep data and samples from patients with atypical diabetes, so scientists can study these forms of diabetes.",Center for Identification and Study of Individuals with Atypical Diabetes Mellitus (U54),9597055,U54DK118638,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Ancillary Study', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diabetes', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological Markers', 'C-Peptide', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorado', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Complication', 'Core Facility', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunology', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Proinsulin', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'college', 'data sharing', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'diabetes mellitus genetics', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic registry', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'insight', 'islet', 'learning strategy', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'patient registry', 'phenotypic data', 'polypeptide C', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'repository', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'web site']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U54,2018,2500000,0.11885513467974429
"Quantifying Brain Abnormality by Multimodality Neuroimage Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes, afforded by multimodality neuroimaging data, for both diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's diseases (AD).

"Multi-modal Prediction of Future Clinical Dementia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The process of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is thought to begin years before symptoms. This ""preclinical"" phase, characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation consistent with AD, holds the key to identifying causes and developing therapeutic strategies. In the absence of sensitive and specific behavioral/cognitive tests, quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests will be critical for stratified medicine in preclinical AD. This project will examine two high-dimensional data modalities, namely structural brain MRI scans and genome-wide SNP data, in order to derive tools to compute individual-level predictions about future dementia onset. AD imprints a unique atrophy signature on the brain discernable in structural MRI scans. Converging data suggest that AD-associated atrophy is detectable years before clinical symptoms. The machine learning (or pattern analysis) approach, which our laboratory has advocated in neuroimage analysis, offers highly sensitive and specific atrophy detectors. We hypothesize these tools will be invaluable for identifying preclinical AD subjects who are at increased risk of dementia onset. Late-onset AD (LOAD), which represents >95% of all AD cases, is up to 70% heritable. In addition to APOE4, the major genetic risk factor, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a growing list of other common genetic variants associated with LOAD. The complexity of LOAD's genetic underpinnings suggests that sophisticated models that aggregate data across the genome might help us explain some of the variability in disease progression. Developing such models using state-of-the-art machine learning technology and leveraging already-collected large-scale datasets is one of our main aims in this proposal. The proposed project will build on the principal investigator's (Sabuncu) strong background in computational modeling and machine learning to conduct analyses using cutting-edge methods on large-scale data. We will use multi-modal data, including neuroimaging and GWAS data, to develop and validate models that predict future decline in preclinical LOAD. Our method of choice will be a novel Bayesian ML algorithm, specifically designed for longitudinal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternatives (constructed by discriminating cases and controls) for identifying ""amyloid positive"" individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a multi-level approach for discovery and validation and a multi-modal strategy to test our hypothesis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thanks to recent technological advances we can now reliably detect Alzheimer's pathology in individuals during the preclinical phase, which can last years before symptoms begin. Yet we lack the tools to predict the course of these preclinical individuals, many of which progress to dementia quite quickly, while others remain asymptomatic. The proposed project will leverage large- scale datasets such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and sophisticated data mining techniques to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on multi-modal data, including genetic markers and MRI scans.",Multi-modal Prediction of Future Clinical Dementia,9266742,R21AG050122,"['Adverse effects', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Atrophic', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Disease Progression', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'amyloid pathology', 'base', 'case control', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'detector', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high dimensionality', 'imprint', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'risk minimization', 'tau Proteins', 'tool']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2017,213750,0.16883525575607167
"Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. While research efforts continue to focus on the causes of AD and to develop effective medical treatments, there is also a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. There may be subtle changes in brain and cognitive function that are detectable before major symptoms emerge. One approach for characterizing these vulnerabilities is the use of functional and structural neuroimaging to identify risk profiles for AD. The present study proposes and tests a model of AD pathology using neuroimaging network analysis and machine learning approaches to provide insight on widespread changes in information processing in the AD brain. The proposed model hypothesizes that some aspects of network information processing reflect neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD pathology (e.g., hub connectivity and global connectivity) whereas other network properties reflect attempts to compensate for compromised information processing (e.g., diffusion of information). In addition, this proposal compares the efficacy of models with respect to discriminating diagnostic categories (e.g., machine learning classification of AD and clinically normal subjects) versus isolating underlying dimensions of AD cognitive decline (e.g., machine learning prediction of memory and language scores from network features). Finally, this study will determine whether features of AD pathology are present in an at-risk sample of subjects; namely, individuals diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This will be examined by transferring the AD network models to aMCI subjects and testing whether the model can discriminate aMCI from clinically normal matched controls and whether the model can predict scores on cognitive tests. The analytic approach will using resting state fMRI data as a primary assay of network integrity, but diffusion imaging and task fMRI data will also be examined in an exploratory aim. The general approach will recruit individuals with AD, aMCI and clinically normal matched controls for each diagnostic group. The groups that are compared directly will be matched for amyloid status, as indicated by florbetapir PET imaging. The novel contributions of this project include (a) testing a network model of AD pathology that unifies various measures of network functioning, (b) comparing efficacy of modeling with respect to delineating diagnostic categories versus capturing underlying cognitive dimensions of AD, and (c) transferring the AD model to an at-risk group to assess disease vulnerability. This latter innovation can be applied in future studies to any group of subjects that is defined at risk, such as those with genetic vulnerability or positive family history. The present study also sets the stage for a subsequent longitudinal follow-up study to validate whether individuals identified at risk using network modeling actually convert to AD. Ultimately, network modeling of this sort may be used as a relatively less expensive and less invasive biomarker than PET imaging, which could lead to earlier treatments and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years, there is a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. The present study will use neuroimaging to examine brain connectivity and determine whether some aspects of altered connectivity are present in individuals who are at risk for AD: individuals who have mild cognitive impairment. This approach could be used in the future to possibly detect risk for AD before any cognitive symptoms emerge, thereby enabling earlier treatment and intervention to combat the devastating cognitive, social and financial consequences of AD.",Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease,9245134,R01AG055132,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Center for Health Statistics', 'Well in self', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'combat', 'comparative efficacy', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'response', 'social']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2017,745391,0.2600295958559278
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9356352,UH2NS100599,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Microscopic', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Public Health', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sclerosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'White Matter Disease', 'age related', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical imaging', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'treatment response']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2017,1102656,0.09357514952780385
"Mobile Application to Deliver Personalized Nutrition for the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease Genben Lifesciences (dba GB HealthWatch) is a digital health and nutritional genomics company. Our mission is to help fight common, diet- and lifestyle-related chronic diseases with precision nutrition and advanced mobile technologies. Our company developed the HealthWatch 360 mobile app for tracking dietary intake, physical activity and health-related symptoms. This mobile app has received excellent reviews for both the iOS and Android platforms and has over 70,000 registered users. Health condition- specific goals featured in the app provide refined nutritional recommendations based on clinical guidelines for the prevention of diet-induced, chronic diseases. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the U.S., the 6th leading cause of mortality and a major cost to the nation, families and caregivers. This phase I proposal is for the development of a mobile tool that will deliver personalized nutrition and meal plans based on genetic risk in order to mitigate AD risk. Aim 1: Develop a systematic process to identify specific dietary and nutritional components associated with AD. Using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 database and nutritional analyses of the traditional diets that correspond with the 26 populations, we will analyze whether specific nutrients correlate with the frequency of genetic variants that predispose risk of AD. We hypothesize that a population’s fitness would be enhanced and AD risk would be lower when the genetic variants that are selected for in a given population are in equilibrium with a diet that is enriched or depleted with the correlated nutrient(s). We will develop statistical models that will quantify these relationships. Aim 2: Translate nutritional patterns to a set of quantitative recommendations for AD prevention. With the nutrient data we obtain from Aim 1, combined with other evidence-based nutrition guidelines for AD, we will synthesize a set of qualitative and quantitative nutritional “rules” based on the app user’s genotypes, family history of AD and other health conditions. These genotype- and/or phenotype - specific rules will estimate ideal ranges for a given nutrient and amend the conventional “rules” (i.e. nutritional recommendations) by the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for America. Aim 3: Mobile app for delivery of personalized meal plan for the prevention of AD. This mobile application is designed for guided, proactive and self-executed prevention of AD, and targeted at those who are at elevated risk. We propose developing machine-learning algorithms to create meal plans that employ the modified nutrient ranges (from Aims 1 and 2) for a given AD risk genotype. Users will be able to modify food preference parameters (for example, “vegetarian”) while maintaining the appropriate nutrient ranges. A key outcome of this project will be a platform that supports population-wide dietary intervention by seamlessly connecting preventive healthcare with daily life in the digital age. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia in the US with over 5 million people suffering from this neurodegenerative disease. Aside from those actually suffering with Alzheimer’s, this devastating disease takes an enormous toll on families and caregivers and is estimated to cost over $200 billion in the US alone. The exact cause of Alzheimer’s disease is still being studied but there is a significant genetic component, with APOE alleles most strongly predictive. Nonetheless, diet and lifestyle interventions have been shown to mitigate Alzheimer’s risk even in those with APOE risk allele(s). Alzheimer’s pathology begins decades before symptoms appear and therefore making dietary and lifestyle changes earlier in life would be a cost-effective means of preventing disease later in life. This proposal aims to develop a low-cost, evidence-based, mobile app that delivers personalized nutritional recommendations in the form of meal plans to those with genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease.",Mobile Application to Deliver Personalized Nutrition for the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease,9518200,R43AG055203,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Americas', 'Android', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family history of', 'Food Preferences', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Mission', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention Guidelines', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Translating', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'evidence base', 'fighting', 'fitness', 'genetic variant', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'nutrition', 'nutritional genomics', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIA,GENBEN LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION,R43,2017,133148,0.20733475080269093
"Brain - Plasma Proteomics Biomarker Discovery and Validation in the US and UK There is an unmet need to develop novel biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that are minimally invasive and that more broadly serve as accurate indicators of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms in brain, including impaired neuronal and synaptic function, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Previous attempts to profile blood proteomes have been hindered by the relatively small number of proteins measured, difficulties linking their expression to AD brain and various disease processes, and poor replicability. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel plasma protein biomarker platform for AD by deeply profiling the proteomes of matched brain and plasma samples from the same cases, linking the protein networks to the extensive clinical, pathological, and molecular data available in the Accelerating Medicine Partnership for AD (AMP-AD) to nominate candidate plasma protein biomarkers and validate their performance in several independent cohorts. The research will extend and leverage our contributions to the AMP-AD consortium using discovery proteomics and systems biology to generate protein co-expression networks for human post- mortem AD brain. Our initial studies have revealed biologically meaningful groups of co-expressed proteins (i.e., modules) in cortex of AD cases that strongly correlate with key traits such as diagnosis, cognition and neuropathology. The modules identify proteins and pathways involved in AD pathophysiological processes (e.g., synaptic and cytoskeletal dysfunction, inflammation, apoptosis, and others), with stronger trait- associations than in RNA expression networks, high reproducibility across all AMP-AD cohorts, and progressive change from preclinical stages to advanced AD. In the proposed research, our collaborative teams of experts from Emory, Rush, and Oxford will first extend the discovery proteomic analyses in AMP-AD using next generation mass spectrometry and aptamer arrays, increasing the depth of protein coverage several-fold, measuring ~6000 proteins in brain (Aim 1) and plasma (Aim 2) from the same control, AD, and non-AD dementia cases in the Religious Orders Study and Memory Aging Project. An integrative analysis and machine learning will be used to nominate ~100 plasma protein candidate biomarkers most strongly associated with diagnosis, and key clinical, molecular and pathological endophenotypes. The performance of the candidate biomarkers will then be assessed using >2000 samples in three independent cohorts from the M²OVE-AD consortium, the European Medical Information Framework, and Dementia Platform United Kingdom (Aim 3), The results will amplify the impact of the AMP-AD and M²OVE-AD consortia with rapid and full data sharing, and establish an innovative pipeline for discovery and validation of plasma proteomics biomarkers that serve as robust and reproducible indicators of AD, including the dysregulated processes that occur in brain. There is an unmet need to develop novel blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the proposed research, we use new sensitive proteomic discovery methods and systems biology tools to identify the proteins altered in AD brain and plasma from the same cases in the Religious Orders Study and Memory Aging Project. The altered proteins in plasma are then evaluated for their accuracy and replicability as candidate biomarkers in three independent cohorts from the M2OVE-AD consortium, the European Medical Information Framework, and Dementia Platform United Kingdom.

"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High-Order Brain Networks Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High- Order Brain Networks Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with no known disease-modifying treatment. Current clinical diagnosis and monitoring of the disease are primarily based on subjective neuropsychological and neurobehavioral assessments, which are generally susceptible to large variability. Objective biomarkers that are sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis and monitoring purposes are hence critically in need. Neuroimaging fits this need and provides objective measures and markers of preclinical disease states for aiding researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitoring their effectiveness. Since AD- related neurological degeneration occurs long before the appearance of clinical symptomatology, additional diagnostic information during the prodromal phase of AD, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is of paramount importance for the success of treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning diagnostic framework based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) for accurate AD diagnosis at the individual level, so as to promote early detection for possible treatment and prophylaxis. Achieving this goal requires significant technical innovations to empower researchers the ability to detect sophisticated yet subtle alteration patterns in brain function. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will harness the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity to provide additional information for accurate identification of individuals who are at risk for AD. This is significantly different from most existing methods that assume temporal stationarity and are therefore unable to take advantage of temporally-evolving connectivity information for more fine-grained characterization of rapidly changing brain states. In Aim 2, we will extract high-order information from functional networks, beyond the commonly used region-pair correlation, for characterizing functional synchronization of the interactions of multiple pairs of regions. This overcomes the over-simplistic pairwise-interaction assumptions of existing methods, and thus allows greater capacity to model complex brain circuitry. In Aim 3, we will fuse information across imaging modalities to complement functional networks with both the white-matter structural networks (generated using diffusion MRI) and the morphological networks (generated using cortical thickness information from anatomical T1-weighted imaging). This will allow complementary information from different modalities to reinforce each other in improving diagnostic accuracy. Upon successful completion of this project, we expect that the resulting comprehensive, integrated, and effective diagnosis framework will be conducive to improving the success of early detection of MCI/AD, as well as other neurological disorders including schizophrenia, autism, and multiple sclerosis. Narrative Description of Project AD-related neurological degeneration occurs long before the appearance of clinical symptomatology.

"Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer Disease (AD), and the existing studies have suggested that the individuals with amnestic MCI tend to progress to probable AD at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year. Early prediction of MCI patients with high risk of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Recent advances in acquiring multi-dimensional and longitudinal brain imaging and genome-wide array data provide exciting new opportunities to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. Integrating such multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data holds great promise for a system biology of the brain to better understand the complex neurobiological mechanism of conversion of MCI to AD. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these neuroimaging genomic data sets have presented critical computational challenges for achieving the full transformative potential from comprehensive joint analysis of these heterogeneous and longitudinal data sets. This project aims to address these emerging challenges for early prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion with four aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel sparse bi-multivariate learning model based system biology framework for analysis of genome-wide association results across a large number of the structural and functional phenotypes derived from neuroimaging scans of the whole brain. Our new methods are designed for bi-multivariate analysis of high-throughput genomic data and complex Quantitative Traits (QTs) related to MCI-to-AD conversion by utilizing the system biology knowledge. Aim 2 is to further extend the learning approaches in Aim 1 with the new structured sparse models to the multi-dimensional data integration methods to identify the heterogeneous biomarkers from multiscale interrelated imaging genomic data for outcome prediction. Meanwhile, we will utilize the joint multi-task learning scheme to identify the stable genetic and phenotypic biomarkers that are associated with cognitive functions decline and MCI-to-AD conversion simultaneously. Based on the studies in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 is focused on revealing the longitudinal biomarkers of the changes of MCI progression or cognitive impairment by a new structured low-rank multi-task regression model. These biomarkers can fully differentiate longitudinal profiles of relevant QTs and better capture genetic associations with QT changes over time. Aim 4 is to evaluate and validate our proposed machine learning and bioinformatics algorithms on both synthetic data and real imaging genomic data. The results of this project will be able to efficiently improve our understanding of the complex neurobiological mechanism underlying the MCI-to-AD conversion. The identified biomarkers will finally enhance the early and accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion such that the clinical treatment can be provided in time. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Existing research works mainly focus on the studies using single genetic or neuroimaging data source and seldom consider the longitudinal data profiles. To address these limitations, this project focuses on 1) the development of novel bioinformatics and machine learning models for solving the computational challenges of analyzing the emerging multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data, and 2) identification of biomarkers with prediction power on MCI-to-AD conversion from the large and complex heterogeneous imaging genomic data with the comprehensive system biology knowledge guidance.",Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction,9268503,R01AG049371,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'case control', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'simulation', 'success', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ARLINGTON,R01,2017,403691,0.1891014609949589
"Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology Abstract  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple health threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, efforts in drug discovery and repurposing for the treatment of AD have had limited success. The failure is largely attributed to the adoption of a reductionist model of “one-drug-one-gene- one-disease”. As AD is a multi-facet complex disease, a new treatment approach is urgently needed to simultaneously target multiple pathological processes responsible for the onset and progress of AD, some of which are also common to other diseases that cause dementia. In this application, we will develop an innovative translational bioinformatics approach to addressing challenges in AD drug discovery. Our approach is based on a new paradigm of systems pharmacology, which focuses on defining multiple targets to a single drug or a drug combination, and studying the effect of the drug(s) on perturbing disease-causing networks. Over the last ten years, we have developed a novel structural systems pharmacology (SSP) platform that can predict genome-wide high-resolution protein-chemical interactions and correlate molecular interactions with phenotype responses. The SSP platform synergistically combines novel methods from machine learning, bioinformatics, biophysics, and systems biology. We have successfully applied the SSP platform to drug repurposing, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, precision medicine, and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, and in close collaborations with experimental laboratories, we will develop, and rigorously test a novel SSP approach to AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology. Firstly, we will develop a multi-layered drug-gene-pathway-disease-side effect network model (MULAN) that links FDA-approved drugs with dementia and side effects through protein-chemical interactions, gene-disease associations, chemical-disease associations, and dementia-associated biological pathways through integrating multiple omics data. Secondly, we will improve and apply our proven successful SSP platform, which can accurately infer novel relations from sparse and noisy MULAN, to identify safe FDA- approved drugs that can be repurposed for AD treatment. Finally, we will experimentally test FDA-approved drugs identified for their binding activity of drug targets and anti-AD potency in cell and animal models. The successful completion of this project will provide an integrated computational modeling framework for AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology as well as identify novel targeted anti-AD therapeutics toward pre-clinical trials. Relevance Statement Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, AD is a complex disease that has been extremely hard to treat with the conventional approach.

"PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in adults over the age of 65, and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the leading cause of dementia in middle age, with the behavioral variant subtype (bvFTD) being the most prevalent form. The relationships between clinical syndromes and pathological causes are complex, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult. For example, multiple studies have indicated that a significant proportion of cases of AD-like dementia show evidence of non-AD pathology, such as inclusions of the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein associated with clinical FTD. Also, AD neuropathology has been found in 15–30% of patient with the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers will be needed, so that they can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient populations. In this project, we will focus on clinically diagnosed bvFTD and AD patients, and apply machine learning to multimodal neuroimaging (T1, FDG-PET) data pooled from large, multisite studies of AD and FTD. Our goal is to develop novel biomarkers that can differentiate bvFTD, AD and controls. Our hypothesis is that each neuropathology is associated with a distinct biomarker signature, and these signatures can be discovered through well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical profiles. We will use available amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of β-amyloid and tau to assess the robustness of our predictions of AD neuropathologies. In Aim 1 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal structural imaging to develop predictive biomarker models for differentiating bvFTD vs. AD. In Aim 2 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal FDG-PET imaging to develop predictive biomarker models. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the combination of structural and FDG-PET imaging as predictive biomarker models.  Relevance: This research supports NIH initiatives on long-term, personalized precision medicine and big data science. Our predictive biomarker models can inform participant selection in clinical trials so that we can identify disease-modifying treatments with greater power. Our system-biology approach can enable us to generate new questions on mechanisms underlying the origin and progression of neuro-pathological processes, create new data and computational tools that can in turn generate new insights and new hypotheses. NARRATIVE  Accurate diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is difficult because the relationships between clinical syndromes, and pathological and genetic causes are complex. In this project, we propose to use machine learning technologies to develop powerful predictive biomarkers that can distinguish bvFTD, AD and healthy controls, using well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical data from multiple national databases.

"Predictive Analytics for Alzheimer's Disease Dementia PROJECT SUMMARY Increasing geriatric population and patients with multiple chronic conditions have exacerbated the crisis of a rapid increase in number of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. AD is the primary cause of dementia, and is responsible for over eleven million disability-adjusted life years (DALY) globally. Overwhelming evidence indicates that progression of AD is associated with increased dependency, resource utilization, and costs of care. The diagnosis of AD and onset of dementia not only places an emotional burden on patients, but the costs associated with Alzheimer’s care also places substantial financial burden on families, who often must make significant changes in their economic lifestyles to extend care. To mitigate the health, emotional, and financial burden associated with AD, we need to identify those at risk long before they develop symptoms of dementia. Early symptoms of dementia, such as memory impairment, may not be apparent during the current practice of primary care visits, unless directly assessed or adequately informed. Hence, it is not surprising that many studies reveal delayed and/or undocumented diagnosis of dementia among primary care providers. To address this critical unmet need, we propose to use machine learning and advanced predictive analytics and perform retrospective and prospective analysis of data, including clinical data from existing patient medical records, financial data from reimbursement claims, and demographic data from population health records to identify clinical, co-morbid, pharmaceutical, environmental, and other variables related to onset and progression of dementia. The overarching goal of the present study is to develop a comprehensive decision support tool that would predict cost drivers, outcome measures and trajectory of dementia onset in AD patients. To achieve our goals, we are working in collaboration with Chris Craver, Senior Director, Health Data Analytics at Vizient Inc., and Dr. Ronald Petersen, Director of Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at Mayo Clinic Rochester. We have now curated data from over 72,000 AD patients and 100,000 age-matched controls to date, and are now proposing to pursue studies with the following specific aims. Aim #1: Using descriptive analytics, create an interactive, secure, web-based interface to enable benchmarking of key metrics for AD and AD dementia, including population health metrics, co-morbidities and risk factors, therapeutic drug regimens, and the true costs of episodes of care. Aim #2: Develop an electronic health record (EHR) agnostic, HIPAA- compliant tool for predicting the development of AD-dementia, its disease trajectory and outcomes, medication utilization, total annual cost of care, and any diagnostics or therapeutics to augment adverse events. Successful completion of studies proposed in this application would enable physicians and care providers to better understand their AD patients with dementia. Additionally, product developed through this grant study would benefit key stakeholders in healthcare market place, including Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurers, hospitals and health systems, in addition to AD patients and caregivers. NARRATIVE While Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and aging have several common pathogenic events and underlying risk factors, diagnosis of AD not only affects the patient but also places enormous emotional and financial burden on families and care providers. There remains an urgent need to reduce this burden by providing information, in advance, on the course of AD and costs associated with care. The work proposed in this application seek to address this problem by using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, and identifying patients at risk of cognitive decline and dementia. By empowering physicians, care providers, insurers and health systems with relevant patient information, we will delineate trajectory of the disease, and help refine the current guidelines for dementia. Our rationale for such a comprehensive approach is that by augmenting clinical interventions and reducing inefficient resource consumption, we will advance value-based care.",Predictive Analytics for Alzheimer's Disease Dementia,9465969,R43AG058480,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Benchmarking', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Consumption', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergent care', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory impairment', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care episode', 'cost', 'craver', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'empowered', 'falls', 'health data', 'health record', 'insight', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'population health', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web based interface']",NIA,"APRIHEALTH, INC.",R43,2017,144450,0.18940684816874567
"Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease Consortium Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE ε4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities AD, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE ε4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population, and clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET-positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points – baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD only, all measures) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow more than 400 people with EOAD in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease Consortium,9562717,R56AG057195,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Language', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Presenile Alzheimer Dementia', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Procedures', 'Psychometrics', 'RNA', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'age related', 'biomarker development', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder control', 'genetic risk factor', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'presenilin-1', 'risk variant', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment trial']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R56,2017,7654317,0.20400061811098008
"The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Genomic studies for late-onset AD (LOAD) have identified over 20 risk loci; however, translating the relevant molecules identified by genomics to AD-specific mechanistic pathways has been challenging. Our application, entitled “The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline Revealed by Next- Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,” is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing a uniquely innovative molecular imaging platform called multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) that will determine high dimensional protein interactions for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomics studies in normal and pathological states. Our proposal has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze four regions in healthy aged brains: two sectors of the hippocampal pyramidal layer and from two isocortical regions. Next- generation MIBI instrumentation will be used to image simultaneously 30+ proteins that mark subtypes of neurons, synapses, and non-neuronal cells, while covering regulatory signaling, neuro-inflammatory components, and AD risk gene protein products with subcellular resolution. In Aim 2, we propose to use the same multiplexed imaging methods in AD brain stratified by APOE genotype. We will analyze these data with statistical machine learning methods already established in our laboratory, similar to what we have done previously with different cancers and the immune system. In Aim 3, using infrastructure we have already have established, we will create a web-based portal where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi- color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features we derive shared freely. We propose a transformative, collaborative approach to AD that leverages a long-standing NIA-funded longitudinal cohort and is highly responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan. These novel insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets and will create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD. Project Narrative AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate a phenotypic landscape of cognitive decline, to understand modulation of cognitive decline during compensation and relate genetic predisposition to changes in phenotypic landscape defined by muti-parametric measurements using enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI).  ",The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,9360517,R01AG056287,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Electrons', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Laboratories', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Middle frontal gyrus structure', 'Molecular', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'burden of illness', 'collaborative approach', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'gene product', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'mental state', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'symposium']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,562550,0.2274197174991437
"The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD Project Summary Improving vascular health for delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is identified as a critical goal by the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Conference, the 2015 NIA AD Summit and PAR-15-356 (to which this application is responding). Yet, critical barriers exist to implementing vascular prevention strategies for AD, and elucidating the role of midlife metabolic, macro- and micro- vascular factors in AD is essential to addressing these barriers. Each type of factor may manifest different pathologies in the brain that contribute to dementia sub-types, making a new and sufficiently comprehensive clinical trial a costly and time-consuming undertaking. To address this essential gap, we propose to leverage the rich longitudinal cohort data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study with the addition of detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain neuroimaging – the MESA VASCAD study. MESA participants at the Wake Forest site (46% African-American, 54% non-Hispanic Caucasian) have already undergone extensive metabolic and vascular phenotyping, repeated retinal imaging and a brief cognitive assessment in 2010-2012. The MESA VASCAD study will add clinical and cognitive assessments (Uniform Data Set and supplemental cognitive tests); neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid PET); and reanalysis of retinal images. We propose to enroll 540 MESA participants in 2 years and repeat assessments 3 years later to more fully characterize targeted, modifiable vascular risk factors for AD. Through our Specific Aims, we will (1) test the hypothesis that baseline macrovascular and microvascular biomarkers in middle-age predict both standard AD neuroimaging outcomes (e.g. hippocampal volume and amyloid deposition assessed with PET) and more novel cerebrovascular biomarkers (e.g. microinfarcts, lacunar infarcts, neurite density and cerebral microbleeds); (2) determine if changes in metabolic and vascular biomarkers over 15 years predict cognitive and AD biomarker trajectory; and (3) using high-dimensional machine learning approaches, determine common, differential and interactive metabolic and vascular risk factor profiles among racial and APOE genotype groups. This proposed ancillary study, approved by the MESA Steering Committee, is led by a New Investigator with an experienced, multi- disciplinary team of collaborators. The MESA study is an ideal cohort for interrogating the questions in this proposal: it has highly detailed longitudinal risk factor data collected over 15+ years in a diverse cohort, which we can leverage and augment with cerebrovascular biomarkers, AD biomarkers, and cognitive reassessments - thereby creating a comprehensive brain phenotype dataset for vascular and AD risk factors. These new data will enable us to examine the timing and impact of vascular biomarkers on dementia biomarkers and cognitive trajectories before a diagnosis of pre-clinical and clinical AD-related disorders, meeting a critical gap in information that will help guide the development of novel therapeutic or prevention strategies for various forms of AD-related dementias. Project Narrative Vascular and metabolic disorders are proposed as potent modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and may provide key routes for therapeutic and preventive interventions. We propose to leverage the vast resources of the NIH-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study to examine the potential contributions of macrovascular and microvascular subclinical disease to AD-related pathology. At the Wake Forest MESA site, we will add neuroimaging, repeated cognitive testing, and reprocessing of existing digital retinal scans with novel measures of retinal microvascular architecture.",The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD,9335219,R01AG054069,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Age-Years', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Ancillary Study', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Caliber', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coronary', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modality', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurites', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Route', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vascular Diseases', 'adjudicate', 'age related', 'arterial stiffness', 'brain health', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'epigenetic marker', 'experience', 'falls', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'macrovascular disease', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pre-clinical', 'resilience', 'response', 'screening', 'symposium', 'vascular contributions', 'vascular factor', 'vascular risk factor']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,759041,0.22363353595597946
"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology. The completion of our study aims will advance the development of an affordable screening tool that can be utilized in a clinical/community setting to identify individuals who are candidates for comprehensive diagnostic testing.",Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology,9383242,R01AG054523,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrum', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cost Measures', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'glucose metabolism', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'ketogenic diet', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'minimally invasive', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'stem', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,766314,0.2503592496478446
"Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimer's Disease The exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes derived from brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) – including those provided by the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) – by powerful computational tools has the potential of developing new knowledge, including the identification of pathways and targets that may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of the disease. The challenge is validate the importance of those pathways – distinguishing primary disease drivers from secondary events – by finding drugs that impact those pathways. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to probe potential pathways in proof of concept, and ultimately therapeutic, clinical trials. Here, we propose to discover and validate hypotheses for drug repurposing in AD through three integrated, complementary informatics approaches. This bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, uses AMP-AD data as the “laboratory” and electronic heath records(EHR) as our “clinical trial infrastructure”. Specifically, we will apply classical and network aware (prior-loaded) machine learning approaches (which have demonstrated utility in cancer-related omics datasets) to identify pathways and targets altered in AD brains at different stages of disease progression using AMP-AD data (Aim 1); and we will use systems pharmacology approaches to discover the target selectivity of lead compounds in human neuronal and glial cell types using unbiased RNA- seq, proteomic and imaging studies followed by pathway analysis (Aim 2). Aims 1 and 2 each has two approaches: data-driven, hypothesis-generating analyses to discern disease-relevant drug signals; and hypothesis-testing in which positive findings from one approach are evaluated using the other approaches to assess rigor and reproducibility. In Aim 3, we will develop new informatics strategies to conduct in silico drug trials to validate the clinical relevance of drugs by analyzing EHR, taking advantage of the UK 20 year CPRD longitudinal records of 15M people. A second independent EHR data set, the RPDR Database (based at Mass General Hospital) with 6 M individuals followed for over 20 years, will further validate hypotheses based on the omics data sets and extant literature. This coordinated informatics program compensates for the weaknesses of each individual informatics approach to promote discovery and critical evaluation of “lead compounds” for at least some AD pathways. To execute this strategy, we have assembled a team with expertise ranging from clinical care to computer science and systems pharmacology. Some of the team members are AD experts and others bring an outsider's perspective. Finally, as a deliverable, we will create open-source data packages to release all the supporting evidence, software, and data with provenance in accordance with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) standards through Synapse and the DataLens platform developed at MGH (Aim 4). These data packages will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies including collaborations with industry or members of the larger biomedical community involved in new clinical trials. Project Narrative Repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to accelerating proof-of-concept and ultimately therapeutic clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose a bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, using available expression data from AD brains in the public domain as our “laboratory” and electronic heath records(EHR) as our “clinical trial infrastructure”. Resulting data packages from these analyses will be shared on Open Science platforms and will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies, ultimately leading to new clinical trials.",Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimer's Disease,9565013,R56AG058063,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lewy Bodies', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular Target', 'Mono-S', 'Network-based', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'disease registry', 'drug testing', 'imaging study', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'member', 'neuron loss', 'open data', 'programs', 'protein TDP-43', 'protein expression', 'software development', 'tau phosphorylation', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational study']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2017,835424,0.17819661525365935
"Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in  Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline. These objectives are directly relevant to the global effort to halt AD via early detection of cognitively-healthy persons at high  risk for progressing to AD. This is because current national guidelines for detecting risk for AD i asymptomatic persons call for extensive evaluations (e.g., nuclear imaging and lumbar puncture) that are expensive, not always well-tolerated by research volunteers and, more importantly, not widely available. In contrast, this project will rigorously assess brain changes i Stage 3 preclinical AD using routine, non-invasive, and broadly-deployable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain structure and blood flow. A specific deliverable of this project is the derivation of a single, quantitative, abnormality score that can be used-in combination with pertinent health information-for identifying, on an individual level, asymptomatic persons at heightened risk for AD. Such persons may then benefit from more extensive AD biomarker testing, closer monitoring, and treatment with disease-modifying drugs when such drugs become available. The project's success has material potential to significantly extend the public health reach of the proposed guidelines for defining preclinical AD. The three specific aims addressed in this project are: (1) specify the pattern of brain changes on MRI that is characteristic of Stage 3 preclinical AD, (2) prospectively assess the prognostic utility of an aggregate measure of midlife structural-functional MRI brain changes, and (3) preliminarily evaluate how individual differences related to cognitive reserve and genetic risk modify the association between early brain changes and future decline. Completion of the interrelated set of research and training activities proposed in this K23 will greatly foster the candidate's development into an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in conducting translational and multidisciplinary neuroimaging studies of preclinical AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To forestall the looming AD epidemic, there is need for highly sensitive yet easily deployable methods for identifying cognitively-healthy persons at high risk for AD. This project responds to this public health imperative by pursuing the development of an MRI aggregate measure that is grounded by established AD biomarkers, and is predictive of future cognitive decline in asymptomatic middle-aged adults.",Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD,9279032,K23AG045957,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloidosis', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spin Labels', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Wisconsin', 'base', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'nuclear imaging', 'patient oriented research', 'peer', 'potential biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'responsible research conduct', 'success', 'volunteer']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K23,2017,162800,0.2455910298270455
"Sphingosine-1-phosphate induced modulation of inflammation in aging and Alzheimer's disease Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive molecule that signals by activating S1P receptors (S1P1-5) to regulate cellular processes in systemic immunity and inflammation. Accumulating evidence indicates that ab- normalities of S1P signaling are associated with brain aging and with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's dis- ease (AD). Fingolimod, a sphingosine analog used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), acts through S1P1 in lymphocytes to reduce their infiltration into the CNS and thereby provides therapeutic effects against subsequent neuroinflammation. Fingolimod crosses the blood brain barrier and emerging evidence suggests the direct neuroprotective effect of fingolimod on CNS cells. In experimental models of AD fingolimod appears to reduce the production and the neurotoxicity of Aβ peptide and promote neuroprotection of microglia and neurons. We have reported that in 5xFAD mice, a transgenic model of AD, oral fingolimod treatment decreases the activation of microglia and reactive astrocytes, decreases Aβ levels, and increases hippocampal neuro- genesis. Our preliminary data show that most of the neuroprotective effects of fingolimod in 5xFAD mice occur at a low dose with major effects on neuroinflammatory markers. We hypothesize that aging alters the S1P sig- naling system in the brain and drives the proinflammatory activation of astrocytes and microglia that is acceler- ated by the buildup of Aβ and that treatment with S1P modulators will interfere with this process and may affect age- and AD-related neuropathology and behavioral deficits. To test this hypothesis we will use two different transgenic mouse models of AD (5xFAD and PSAPP) that accumulate Aβ at different rates such that similar amounts of Aβ are deposited in the brain at different ages. The study includes 3 aims. The first two aims are mechanistic studies to determine the effect of age and AD-like pathology on the S1P system in wild type mice and in the mouse models of AD (aim 1) and to determine the effects of S1P receptor modulators on neuroin- flammation in aging and AD mouse models and on AD-related neuropathology and cognitive function in these models (aim 2). The latter studies will include a prevention arm by treating the mice before the emergence of AD-like pathology until old age (1-18 months), and an advanced disease arm by treating the mice with well- established pathology (15-18 months). The outcome measures will include cognitive behavior, amyloidosis, ac- tivation of astrocytes and microglia, S1P system, neurotrophin signaling, e.g. BDNF/TrkB, cytokines, synaptic- glial- and apoptotic markers, and small molecules determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that reflect neural metabolism, excitotoxic, oxidative, and osmotic stress, as well as membrane integrity. Machine learning tools will be employed to integrate these data sets. The third aim will be the translational arm of the study to determine the effects of S1P modulation on indices of neuronal and glial function in aging and in AD mouse models using noninvasive techniques including in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) and positron emission tomography. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent devastating and incurable disease that robs elderly of their mental abilities and creates an enormous burden on families and caregivers. As our population ages, AD is becoming a major public health concern. Our proposed studies are designed to explore the poorly understood signaling pathway mediated by S1P and its receptors, as a component of the pathophysiology of AD and a therapeutic target for this illness.",Sphingosine-1-phosphate induced modulation of inflammation in aging and Alzheimer's disease,9403429,RF1AG056032,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agonist', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloidosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Models', 'Family Caregiver', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'GDNF gene', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Metabolism', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Normalcy', 'Oral', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Sphingolipids', 'Sphingosine', 'Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor', 'Stem cells', 'Stress', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Visuospatial', 'Water', 'Western Blotting', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'advanced disease', 'age effect', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'analog', 'arm', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'conditioned fear', 'cytokine', 'design', 'early onset', 'edg-1 Protein', 'excitotoxicity', 'glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor', 'in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'indexing', 'male', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'neurochemistry', 'neurogenesis', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'neuroprotection', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotrophic factor', 'neurotropin', 'normal aging', 'oligodendrocyte progenitor', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'remyelination', 'response', 'small molecule', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'sphingosine 1-phosphate', 'sphingosine kinase', 'sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase', 'sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase', 'targeted agent', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transgenic model of alzheimer disease', 'treatment effect']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,RF1,2017,2830766,0.21687296249038432
"The study partner requirement in preclinical Alzheimers disease trials Project Summary/Abstract Preclinical Alzheimer's disease clinical trials enroll cognitively normal participants who are willing to undergo disease biomarker testing, learn the results, and take an investigational drug (or placebo) if those results indicate that they are at increased risk for disease. Like traditional trials in Alzheimer's disease dementia, these trials require participants to enroll with a study partner, a person who can attend visits with the participant and report about any changes in the participant's cognitive or functional ability. Like traditional trials in Alzheimer's disease dementia, these trials face logistical challenges related to difficult recruitment. We recently showed that the requirement for a participant to learn their Alzheimer's disease biomarker status was not a barrier to successful recruitment. In contrast, the requirement of enrolling with a study partner was a significant barrier to participation for many potential enrollees. We also observed results that suggested that the study partner barrier was related to the requirement of biomarker testing and disclosure. This project will further investigate the study partner role in preclinical Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. First, we will explore the ethical implications of the study partner requirement, specifically whether this requirement is a barrier to enrollment because participants are unwilling to share their biomarker results with others. Second, we examine the scientific need for study partners, by measuring informants' accuracy and precision in assessing cognitive performance, predicting cognitive decline, and recognizing subtle changes in cognition, and comparing to participants' abilities to perform these roles themselves. These studies will provide valuable data toward improving preclinical AD trial protocol designs, assisting investigators making decisions around 1) whether to require study partners, 2) who is qualified to fill this role, and 3) how participants should be protected against potential stigma related to their eligibility. Project Narrative Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials enroll persons who have no observable cognitive impairment who demonstrate AD biomarkers and often face slow recruitment. This proposal will provide researchers with critical evidence to instruct recruitment that will increase the representativeness of preclinical AD trial subjects and ensure a complete understanding of the ethical issues in these trials, preventing a degradation of trust between researchers and participants and ensuring the safety of those who enroll.",The study partner requirement in preclinical Alzheimers disease trials,9373717,R21AG056931,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inferior', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Placebos', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'Visit', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'data integrity', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'eligible participant', 'improved', 'informant', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'social stigma', 'trial design', 'willingness']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2017,222493,0.12145255224150861
"Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people worldwide. Due to the fact that the longitudinal abnormality associated with AD can be detected in vivo, neuroimaging measures have been playing an increasingly important role in searching for biomarkers of AD that can be used for early diagnosis, progression monitoring, and therapy responses measurement. The goal of this project is to create a set of cutting-edge computational tools for identifying very early biomarkers of AD and alert AD progression via longitudinal image analysis. The key to achieve high sensitivity and specificity AD diagnosis of individuals is the stable longitudinal measurements. In light of this, the candidate will first develop a novel learning-based 4D (3D+t) landmark detector (Aim 1) to find the landmark locations at all time points simultaneously. The trajectories of landmark set form a compact 4D shape representation to achieve temporal consistency in registering longitudinal image sequence to the template (Aim 2). As a result, the consistency of low level features extracted from MR or PET images can be significantly improved. Since the subject-specific patterns of structural/functional changes, although more relevant to AD diagnosis of individuals, is very subtle compared to huge variation across subjects, the candidate will further develop a supervised deep neural network to learn the latent high-level spatial-temporal patterns by coupled stacked auto-encoder and temporal max pooling (Aim 2). The learned spatial-temporal morphological patterns consist of (1) cross- sectional features from MR and PET images, and (2) dynamic short/long term longitudinal patterns w.r.t. different number of historical time points. In a clinical setting, not all patients have a large and complete set of neuroimaging data, or an equal number of imaging scans. In order to eventually translate to clinic arena, a novel AD detector that uses a spatial-temporal hyper-graph learning framework (Aim 3) is proposed to not only provide high sensitivity and specificity in AD diagnosis but also solve the above difficulties. To evaluate the diagnostic value, we will apply our trained AD detector to ADNI dataset and patient data collected in UNC (Aim 3). Finally, we will package all our developed methods into a software package and release it freely to the neuroimaging community, to facilitate other AD-biomarker-exploration projects performed in other institutes. Project Narrative This proposal aims for the development of novel neuroimaging analysis methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal image data. In particular, a set of automated algorithms will be created to aid the difficult task of analyzing subtle and complex morphological change patterns of Alzheimer's disease during the disease progression. The successful completion of this project will represent an import milestone in neuroimaging research by bringing forth the fruition of a powerful and practical system for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at individual level, for potential effective treatment.",Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,9344522,K01AG049089,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'computerized tools', 'detector', 'disease diagnosis', 'economic cost', 'effective therapy', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'functional loss', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'social', 'specific biomarkers', 'task analysis', 'tool']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2017,117098,0.2173188403503302
"An Integrated Reverse Engineering Approach Toward Rapid drug Re positioning for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and one of the leading sources of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. Despite enormous social and economic costs associated with AD, current drugs are directed towards symptomatic relief and none are curative. In this project titled “An integrated reverse engineering approach toward rapid drug repositioning for Alzheimer’s disease,” we propose to develop an innovative integrated drug repositioning strategy that combines computation-based drug prediction, computation-based human brain-blood-barrier (BBB) permeability prediction, retrospective large-scale clinical corroboration, and prospective experimental testing to rapidly identify anti-AD drug candidates. First, we will develop novel computational approaches to identify repositioning anti-AD candidates from all (>2,600) FDA-approved drugs. Second, we will develop novel multifaceted biology-based computational methods to predict which repositioned drug candidates can cross BBB in humans. Third, we will perform large-scale retrospective case-control studies to corroborate the clinical efficacy of repositioned drug candidates using patient electronic health record (EHR) data of >50 million patients. Finally, we will evaluate the therapeutic potential of promising repositioned candidates in experimental models. Our study will generate a large amount of data/knowledge/hypotheses that could serve as a starting point for us and others to conduct hypothesis-driven drug repositioning studies in other animal models of AD and in AD patients. We will build a comprehensive Alzheimer Drug Repositioning Knowledge Base (ADRKB) and develop interactive web applications to make ADRKB publicly available. The unique and powerful strength of our project is our ability to seamlessly combine novel computational predictions, retrospective clinical corroboration using patient EHRs, and experimental testing in animal models of AD to rapidly identify innovative drug candidates that may work in real-world AD patients. The repositioned drug candidates will have interpretable mechanisms of action, are highly likely to cross BBB in humans, have clinical effectiveness evidence gathered from ‘real-world’ AD patients, and have demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of AD. We anticipate that these findings can be expeditiously translated into clinical trials and benefit 5.4 million AD patients in United States and 47 million AD patients worldwide. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes enormous personal and societal burdens. Currently there exist no cures for AD. In this project titled “An integrated reverse engineering approach toward rapid drug repositioning for Alzheimer’s disease,” we propose to develop an innovative integrated drug repositioning strategy that combines novel computational drug prediction, novel computational brain-blood-barrier (BBB) permeability prediction, retrospective large-scale clinical corroboration, and prospective experimental testing to rapidly identify repositioned anti-AD drug candidates. The output of our project will be a list of ranked repositioned drug candidates with interpretable mechanisms of action, high BBB permeability in humans, supporting clinical efficacy evidence gathered from ‘real-world’ AD patients, and demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of AD. We anticipate that these findings can be expeditiously translated into clinical trials and benefit AD patients.

"The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD The goal of this ongoing R01 is to chart the progression of pathobiologic markers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their effect on neural function and cognition in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with risk for AD. There is an appreciable gap in knowledge about the temporal disease course in this age range that this ongoing project has been directly addressing with serial multimodal imaging including amyloid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, and serial cognitive measurement. In the next funding cycle we will add a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique sensitive to fibrillar tau [F-18]THK5351 indexing neurofibrillary pathology. In the prior funding period we recruited 179 individuals from a registry of 1,545 people at risk for AD known as WRAP (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention). We found that [C-11]PIB amyloid burden is detectable in 20% of people with parental history of AD at a mean age of 60. Baseline amyloid is more extensive in the presence of higher CSF total tau levels, and 2-year increases in PiB amyloid are significantly predicted by higher baseline CSF tau. The hypothesis for this renewal is that tau- related neurofibrillar pathology begins early (in accord with the neuropathology literature) in people at AD risk and its strategic spatial burden explains changes in amyloid, neural function and cognitive decline. Aim 1: To test the premise that amyloid burden is necessary but not sufficient to evoke preclinical cognitive change. We will examine effects of longitudinal amyloid and tau change on episodic memory trajectories over time in 235 at risk individuals including all subjects we previously enrolled and follow them over 2 years with advanced multimodal imaging and CSF. Aim 2: To assess the effects of tau and amyloid imaging on MRI and CSF indicators of neural injury and function. Aim 3: To develop a multimodal disease marker to maximize efficiency of clinical trials in preclinical AD. Following our work in creating tools for efficient clinical trials in MCI, we will extend these concepts to the pre-MCI phase of disease utilizing deep learning architectures with tau, amyloid and structural imaging inputs. We will also examine change over time in tau, amyloid and cognition as outcomes. As any of these features considered singularly may be affected by age, and as amyloid and tau may be `necessary but not sufficient' by themselves, a derived multimodal marker may have eventual clinical utility in enriching prevention trials with those most likely to progress, and increasing power to detect change attributable to preclinical interventions. Significance: Relative tau and amyloid imaging profiles have not been empirically established in the presymptomatic time frame and this information is urgently needed to identify incipient disease. No comparable studies exist regarding the evolution of tau and amyloid signal in the critical late-middle-age time frame of preclinical AD. This ongoing project represents a unique opportunity to examine the earliest determinants of AD progression, when treatments may be most meaningful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/ NARRATIVE Identifying the earliest neuropathological features of AD including tau and amyloid pathology will improve early detection and inform clinical trials in the presymptomatic time frame. This project will examine these features with advanced imaging methods in a cohort at risk for AD who are largely asymptomatic. An outgrowth of the project will be information about the rate of change in AD pathology which can help us plan clinical trials in this population using derived outcomes about the brain itself, thereby reducing the number of subjects needed in a trial and increasing sensitivity to detecting change.",The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD,9341059,R01AG021155,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Memory Loss', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention trial', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Secondary to', 'Semantic memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'amyloid pathology', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'cost', 'entorhinal cortex', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nerve injury', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,1437140,0.2175878964403022
"Manifold-valued statistical models for longitudinal morphometic analysis in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) Project Summary The ability to quantitatively characterize incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in its preclinical stage is a critical step for early interventions involving disease modifying therapy and for designing efficient clinical trials to test therapy efficacy. This project focuses on deriving statistical image analysis methods for identifying the relationship of morphometric changes in this early stage with direct indicators of AD pathology (such as amyloid deposition) and various risk factors such as family history in late midlife adults who are cognitively healthy. The proposed analysis will be conducted on the largest preclinical AD cohort assembled to date and help elucidate how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals at risk for AD. The core of our analyses is a set of algorithms that allow operating directly on powerful “manifold-valued” representations of morphometric change and consequently yield high sensitivity in picking up real but statistically weak multi-modal patterns of the disease process. Hypothesis: 1) Detecting precise associations between morphometric changes in preclinical AD subjects with amyloid burden and various risk factors is possible using new algorithms that work directly with representations of the Jacobians of the deformation fields derived from longitudinal imaging data. 2) Conducting such analyses on a large multi-site cohort of asymptomatic at-risk preclinical AD individuals with identified AD pathology will a) reveal important insights into early disease processes when dementia is 15+ years away, b) provide preclinical AD biomarkers and c) provide frameworks for predicting clinical endpoints at the level of individual subjects. Specific Aims: 1) To develop new algorithms for performing statistical analysis of manifold representations of morphometric changes concurrently with multiple covariates representing risk factors, AD pathology markers, and clinical/cognitive measures. 2) Conducting an end-to-end analysis of two independent preclinical AD cohorts to identify the relationship of morphometric changes with various predictors as well as test/retest validation across sites. 3) Analyzing the largest preclinical AD cohort to date for characterizing the relationship of the entire spectrum of predictors to clinical endpoints for late midlife individuals. 4) Providing industry- strength open-source software implementing the full suite of models, integrated with existing software toolboxes, for deployments on a workstation, a high throughput cluster or the cloud. Significance: This project will have a significant impact across three distinct areas of brain imaging research: 1) characterization of how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals in the earliest stages of AD, 2) rigorous algorithms for morphometric change analysis in neuroimaging and neuroscience, 3) open-source end-to-end implementations of the algorithms for use within the community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project will develop novel statistical image analysis methods to characterize complex morphological brain changes in healthy individuals who are at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also have some evidence of AD related pathology. Studying and quantifying the evolution of early disease processes in late midlife adults (who are cognitively healthy) on the largest “preclinical” AD cohorts assembled to date will yield frameworks that tie such disease patterns to precise clinical endpoints, such as cognitive decline. These preclinical AD biomarkers have direct applications in a) design of clinical trials for new therapies and b) eventual translation to clinical practice.",Manifold-valued statistical models for longitudinal morphometic analysis in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD),9360117,R01EB022883,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'design', 'direct application', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'pre-clinical', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tau Proteins', 'therapy design', 'user friendly software', 'web interface']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,331530,0.2757801065433754
"CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder. Inflammatory changes in the brain are thought to represent key processes in the onset and progression of AD, but it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation confers neuroprotection, accelerated degeneration, or possibly both. Such an understanding in living humans is critical if we are to begin clinical trials using the array of FDA-approved immunomodulatory drugs in the future. We propose that complement- mediated neuroinflammation is protective in the early AD stages, while suppression of complement activities is accompanied by the development of greater cognitive deficits and faster cognitive decline. Our preliminary data from multiple cohorts support this hypothesis by showing 1) reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement-related markers occur in the dementia stage but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD; 2) reduced CSF complement-related markers and elevated CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with faster decline in AD; and 3) CSF inflammatory protein alterations reveal networks of cellular and protein regulations. In the In the current application, we will build on the association between complement related proteins and rates of cognitive decline in AD to identify associated changes in soluble CSF cytokines and chemokines, differential inflammatory cell type regulation, and imaging correlates of neuroinflammation. This application takes advantage of our group’s strengths in performing CSF cytokine measurements, CSF immunophenotyping, molecular imaging of neuroinflammation through positron emission tomography (PET) and iron-enhanced MRI, and network analysis through a novel biochemical-bioinformatics pipeline. We will directly identify individual and networks of soluble CSF cytokines that accompany the transition from the MCI to the dementia stage of AD, correlate the complement and other altered pathways with microglial activation through two modern PET tracers (11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA), and measure changes in individual T helper cell (type 1, 2, 17) and non-T cell populations. This application represents the first attempt to correlate, at the individual level and at the group level, CSF and imaging measures of neuroinflammation. If successful, this application will advance the understanding of neuroinflammation in AD through parallel approaches, form the basis of a new biomarker panel (and algorithm) to diagnose AD through a combination of degenerative and inflammatory markers, and accelerate the target identification of future therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system in AD. Brain inflammation is a key event in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but it is not clear whether it is harmful, protective, or both. The current proposal aims to confirm our finding that a switch from the protective to harmful type of inflammation predicts more severe symptoms and faster progression in Alzheimer’s disease, and we can identify people with the protective and harmful inflammation by studying the cerebrospinal fluid (circulating proteins and cells) and brain imaging (PET and MRI scans).","CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease",9325386,R01AG054046,"['Acute', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement Suppression', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Encephalitis', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fractalkine', 'Future', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune system', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-7', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Phagocytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'biomarker panel', 'brain dysfunction', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'demographics', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'iron oxide', 'macrophage', 'migration', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'neuroprotection', 'novel']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,761132,0.20402257234873727
"A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials PROJECT SUMMARY It is our hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous conditions and, therefore, a paradigm shift is required to identify specific subpopulations for targeted interventions. This approach has generated significant success in other complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. A key opportunity in this context is the identification of those most likely to benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs and other anti-inflammatory compounds. The relation between inflammation and the development of AD, MCI, and cognitive decline has received a great deal of attention with basic science and observational human studies demonstrating a protective effect against cognitive loss. Likewise, in our work, inflammation has been a key mechanism in the biological profile that is indicative of disease presence. Based on a wealth of literature (epidemiological, cross-sectional, pathobiological and animal model), multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the utility of NSAID compounds in treating or preventing AD (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study [ADCS] AD and MCI anti-inflammatory trials; Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial [ADAPT]); however, each of these studies failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit, in fact some patients may have exhibited worsening cognitive performance with treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that particular subsets of patients in these trials did benefit from treatment and that our blood-based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify both positive and adverse responders within these trials. Here we propose to leverage three previously conducted clinical trials to test our hypothesis that our blood- based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify the subsets of patients who benefited from these previously conducted clinical trials. By conducting proteomic assays from existing biorepositories from the ADCS and ADAPT, we will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate the utility of the proinflammatory endophenotype as a means for patient selection into NSAID therapy for treating and preventing AD; Specific Aim 2. To determine if change in proinflammatory endophenotype scores over time is a biomarker of therapeutic response. By leveraging a highly innovative method and substantial existing resources, the current project addresses a significant need in the search for novel approaches AD therapeutics. The significance of the current project is the identification of a specific subset of patients who will experience clinically significant cognitive benefit from administration of NSAID medication. If successful, the current project will set the stage for a novel clinical trial that enrolls patients specifically based on baseline proinflammatory endophenotype scores for administration of NSAID therapy. In the long-term, this line of research is designed to build a person-centered (i.e. personalized) approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's diseases are a growing public health crisis impacting millions of elders world-wide with a health care cost greater than cancer and equivalent to cardiovascular disease. Current treatments only slow progression of the disease and new strategies are urgently needed. The relevance of the current project is the validation of a person-centered approach to treating Alzheimer's disease by identifying specific subgroups that are most likely to respond to targeted therapies. The outcomes of this project will fundamentally change the approach to the search for novel therapies for AD from the “one-size-fits-all” approach to the search for specific subgroups that can be treated with targeted medications.",A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials,9344521,R01AG051848,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'IL18 gene', 'IL5 gene', 'IL6 gene', 'IL7 gene', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-10', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Naproxen', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Prevention trial', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'arm', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R01,2017,681438,0.1681821278576562
"Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been identified as one of the strongest genetic determinants of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In general, the e4 allele is associated with reductions in neural protection and repair, increasing a carrier’s vulnerability to damage accumulated over his/her lifetime. Nevertheless, while the penetrance of ApoE e4 is relatively high, a significant proportion of e4 carriers will never develop AD. The overall goal of this project is to model interactions across multiple omics networks to identify the biological pathways involved in sporadic AD susceptibility versus resilience among high-risk individuals. The multifactorial nature of AD suggests that it may manifest as a result of complex interactions across the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Identifying the central networks involved in AD pathogenesis will require integrative Systems Biology approaches. The proposed research offers a new and innovative way to integrate networks—a dominant feature in biology—across multiple tissues and omics platforms, in order to identify innate and dynamic precursors of resilience to AD, among a high-risk population (e4+). Towards this goal, we will: (1) employ newly developed GWAS-based network analysis, to identify SNP networks that alter the association between ApoE e4 and cognitive decline/dementia; (2) generate DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from brain samples that we will analyze using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (3) generate proteomic data from brain and CSF samples that we will analyze using WGCNA to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (4) use advanced integromic network analysis to identify multi-omics and multi-tissue pathways and biological systems involved in AD resilience. The integration of multiple 'omics' data using systems biology will be crucial for unraveling the connections and interactions between various functional levels involved in complex diseases, such as AD. Overall, our proposed research will improve understanding of the complex biology underlying AD susceptibility. These studies have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets that could inform the development of future pharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing or slowing AD pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with the ApoE e4 genotype have a substantially increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this project is identify underlying biological interactions and networks that explain why some e4 carriers do not develop Alzheimer's disease, despite being high-risk. This research has the potential to uncover novel targets that can lead to the development of effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers,9439657,R01AG057912,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'biological systems', 'computer based statistical methods', 'effective therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multiple omics', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'resilience', 'screening', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,1189957,0.238501232457794
"Assessing cellular aging in old and rejuvenated neurons from Alzheimer patients SUMMARY  Dr. Jerome Mertens is a stem cell biologist specialized in modeling human neurodegenerative diseases. During his graduate studies under the supervision of Dr. O. Brüstle (University of Bonn), Jerome was extensively trained in human stem cell and reprogramming technologies, and cellular neuroscience, and he published three first-author papers on utilizing human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to model Alzheimer's Disease (AD). As a postdoctoral researcher at the Salk Institute under the supervision of Dr. F.H. Gage, Dr. Mertens acquired an exceptional foundation in functional neuroscience, nuclear pore biology and imaging. Being entirely dedicated to advancing human in vitro disease models, Dr. Mertens' research focus was to better understand complex human brain disorders and the process of neuronal aging. He could show that direct conversion of human fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs) preserves signatures of cell aging, while iPSC reprogramming erases them. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Mertens thus far first-authored three primary research studies in Nature, Cell Stem Cell and Molecular Psychiatry. As an independent scientist, Dr. Mertens seeks bringing together his recent findings on modeling neuronal aging, his permanent interest in AD, and powerful systems biology and bioinformatic technologies to unravel the earliest age-dependent and disease- initiating mechanisms of sporadic AD. In his Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) proposal, Dr. Mertens, together with his Mentor Dr. F.H. Gage, and his Co-Mentors Dr. D. Galasko, Dr. M.W. Hetzer and Dr. G. Yeo, designed a dedicated training plan in systems biology and bioinformatics, and proposes a research project that sets out to reveal the impact of cellular aging in a human model for AD. In the first aim (K99 phase) Dr. Mertens will generate both phenotypically old and rejuvenated neurons from a large set of clinically well- characterized AD patients and matched controls to better understand the impact of neuronal aging on the pathology of sporadic AD. Following an unbiased transcriptome approach, he will analyze for AD-specific gene expression profiles and work to understand which of the AD-specific gene expression signatures and related mechanisms are age-dependent and which are age-independent. In a second aim (K99/R00 phases), Dr. Mertens will study the age-related dysregulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and the import receptor RanBP17, which currently emerge as major topics in aging and neurodegenerative disease research. He will measure nucleo-cytoplasmic compartmentalization in young and old AD neurons and probe for nuclear transport-based mediators of age-dependent AD pathology using live cell imaging approaches. In a third aim (R00 phase), he will generate and analyze iNs from a large set of individuals suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and pre-symptomatic middle-aged donors, in addition to clinical AD patients. His goal is to find a trajectory in the transcriptomic AD motifs to pinpoint the earliest and potentially most treatable mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis, and to develop a biomarker for the detection of pre-disease AD.   NARRATIVE  The project by Dr. Mertens aims at deciphering the molecular and cell biological impact of human aging on Alzheimer's disease patient-specific induced neurons (iNs) and their rejuvenated counterparts (iPSC-iNs). Dr. Mertens will employ unbiased transcriptome approaches to analyze a clinically well-defined cohort of AD patient and control samples, and further extend the study to iNs from pre-AD (MCI) patients to find the earliest and most causative pathological mechanisms of the disease. Dr. Mertens will further extend his studies of age- dependent nuclear pore defects, and their effects on AD neurons.",Assessing cellular aging in old and rejuvenated neurons from Alzheimer patients,9371840,K99AG056679,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell Aging', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Embryonic Development', 'FOXO3A gene', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutate', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Nuclear Pore Complex', 'Nuclear Translocation', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'Publishing', 'Rejuvenation', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cellular pathology', 'cellular targeting', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder control', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'end stage disease', 'familial Alzheimer disease', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'human stem cells', 'imaging approach', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'live cell imaging', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mutant', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'overexpression', 'receptor', 'research study', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIA,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2017,100322,0.16459622414443034
"Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a prospective, community-based 3-generational study that enrolled participants between ages 20-50 and has examined them every 2-4 years to collect extensive lifestyle, vascular, biomarker data; 9300 have GWAS. Embedded in this cohort are 1036 multigenerational families. Surveillance for AD dementia (and MCI) has been ongoing for over 4 decades. We have identified 1421 incident AD, 1767 MCI, enrolled 800+ in a brain donation program, obtained 7000+ 1.5T brain MRI, and repeated, detailed neuropsychological assessments. We have recently obtained extensive omics in ~6000 (gene expression, methylation, miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics) and genomics (50X whole genome sequences [WGS] in 4197 with pedigree-based imputation to 6554) through the NHLBI funded SABRe CVD (omics) and TOPMed (WGS) programs. We seek to leverage these rich resources (>$25 million). We propose these specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain temporal trends in clinical AD dementia in the FHS cohorts. The age-specific incidence of dementia has declined over the past 4 decades among FHS participants (in press). However, the reasons for this decline remain unclear. We thus propose to continue tracking temporal trends in AD dementia and MCI through intensive surveillance, and verifying diagnoses at autopsy. We hypothesize that better education, treatment of some vascular factors and protective lifestyle changes (diet, activity, social engagement) may partially explain these trends. AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention. Whereas the total number of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages, we have 4 decades of Framingham data suggesting that the risk at any given age is declining. We plan to study the reasons for this hopeful trend in detail through continuing our surveillance for dementia and cognitive impairment, collecting cutting edge brain imaging (amyloid and tau-PET, volumes, connectivity and perfusion on MRI) in the dementia-free (preclinical AD), and using sophisticated analysis of very extensive genetic and omic data already collected on Framingham subjects. This could help us better understand AD trends and biology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.   ","Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts",9494795,R01AG054076,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drops', 'Drug Targeting', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Social Network', 'Spin Labels', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time trend', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'base', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genome wide association study', 'good diet', 'grandparent', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'social engagement', 'targeted biomarker', 'tau Proteins', 'tractography', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend', 'vascular factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,167951,0.26700957105653655

AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention. Whereas the total number of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages, we have 4 decades of Framingham data suggesting that the risk at any given age is declining. We plan to study the reasons for this hopeful trend in detail through continuing our surveillance for dementia and cognitive impairment, collecting cutting edge brain imaging (amyloid and tau-PET, volumes, connectivity and perfusion on MRI) in the dementia-free (preclinical AD), and using sophisticated analysis of very extensive genetic and omic data already collected on Framingham subjects. This could help us better understand AD trends and biology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.   ","Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts",9339487,R01AG054076,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drops', 'Drug Targeting', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Social Network', 'Spin Labels', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time trend', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'base', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genome wide association study', 'good diet', 'grandparent', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'social engagement', 'targeted biomarker', 'tau Proteins', 'tractography', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend', 'vascular factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,2811730,0.26700957105653655
"MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a leading cause of disability and death in the US and major global public health problem due to rise in aging population resulting in untold suffering, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies is certain. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Our application is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing to leverage an innovative molecular imaging platform invented at Stanford, multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI). We will determine the high dimensional cellular and subcellular protein-level expression, interaction, and localization for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomic and proteomic studies in resilience and pathologic states using human brain sections from an ongoing proteomic investigation of AD. We hypothesize that in-depth, stage-specific phenotypic signatures extracted from these unique groups will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. We will test our hypothesis through three Specific Aims: (1) Establish a subcellular, phenotypic framework of vulnerable and resistant brain areas. Next-generation MIBI equipment will be used to rigorously image 30+ proteins simultaneously; targets marking subtypes of neurons, synapses, non-neuronal cells, neuro-inflammatory, and vascular components will be concurrently measured. (2) Reveal cognitive resilience multiplexed phenotypes. Using approaches we have successfully applied in other single cell studies, we will analyze multiplexed imaging data with statistical deep learning methods already established in our lab to identify topological, cellular, and molecular phenotypic differences among resilient, co- morbid, and AD dementia. (3) Implement a shared data repository. The power of multiplexed imaging in biology is its ability to reveal co-localization or mutual exclusivity to infer regulatory roles and gain mechanistic insight. To disseminate hundreds of these images from our proposed highly multiplexed study, we will create a web-based portal, using already established infrastructure, where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi-color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features will be shared freely. PROJECT NARRATIVE AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the aging American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. Such signatures will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. Such insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets, as well as create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD.",MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease,9439172,R01AG057915,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Electrons', 'Equipment', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lobule', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'abeta accumulation', 'aging population', 'collaborative approach', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'disease-causing mutation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'nanometer', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'presenilin', 'presenilin-1', 'presenilin-2', 'resilience', 'response to injury', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tissue resource']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,934771,0.18604110527696535
"A machine learning approach to identify Alzheimer's disease therapeutic targets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this project is to enable the use of molecular profiles (e.g., expression data, genetic data, and proteomic data) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to facilitate to identify therapeutic targets. There is a growing availabilit of expression profiles of brain tissues from AD patients and normal subjects, which holds great promise for improving our molecular-level understanding of AD and developing new drugs. The most important step necessary to realize this goal is to identify molecular features, such as expression levels of certain genes, in these data that are predictive of AD phenotypes indicative of the disease progression, such as neuropathological and clinical phenotypes. Despite the pressing need, due to the high-dimensionality of the expression data, it is an open challenge to identify molecular features that are truly associated with a phenotype. This is a critical barrier that impedes progress in identifying therapeutic targets from high-throughput molecular profiles. To resolve this challenge, this project proposes to identify network-based features representing important molecular events in disease progression from gene expression data, and use the identified features to predict AD-related phenotypes. This approach can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the expression data by focusing on a small subset of genes that are likely relevant to AD. In particular, we focus on the following network-features: perturbed genes that have different connectivity patterns with other genes between different AD stages (Aim 1); hubs that are densely connected with other genes in the inferred network in AD (Aim 2); and common hubs (co-hubs) between AD and cardiovascular disease (Aim 2). In each aim, we will develop powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms that can jointly model interactions of genes that are present in multiple heterogeneous datasets. We will apply the identified network-based features to predict neuropathological and clinical phenotypes in the data from a densely phenotyped cohort in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. The features selected to be predictive of these phenotypes will provide us with better insights into the molecular mechanisms driving AD progression, which can lead to effective therapeutic targets. Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to the discovery of the molecular features that are informative of the disease processes and can thus guide drug development. The proposed research will lay the groundwork of an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, a statistician, basic biologists, a internist and a neuropathologist to develop a systematic computational framework for identifying AD therapeutic targets from heterogeneous molecular and clinical profiles. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to improve our molecular-level understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identify novel therapeutic targets. The growing availability of molecular profiles - such as DNA sequence, epigenetic data, RNA expression data and proteomic data - from AD brain tissues holds great promise to identify molecular features (e.g., expression levels of certain genes) that are informative of the disease processes and can thus guide drug development.

"Multi-Modality Image Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approaches for Personalized Diagnostics and Prognostics of MCI due to AD Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the US. More than 5 million people in the US currently have AD and the direct health care cost is over $200 billion per year. Detection of early phase of AD, namely Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), can delay, prevent, and treat this serious disease. The project will develop a clinically-feasible system for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) diagnostics and prognostics, by integrating multi-modality imaging data such as MRI and PET as well as non-imaging data such as clinical assessments, biomarkers, demographics, and genetic information. This project involves three Aims. In Aim #1, we will develop the system by designing diagnostic and prognostic modeling using cross-sectionally incomplete multi-modality data by multitask learning. Our multitask-learning approach that will simultaneously model multiple related tasks by allowing effective knowledge and data sharing to jointly estimate the diagnostic/prognostic models for each patient cohort. In Aim #2, we will update diagnostic and prognostic model using longitudinally incomplete multi-modality data by transfer learning. We will integrate the model of an old domain (e.g., the diagnostic/prognostic model obtained at an earlier time point) and the data of a new domain (e.g., new data obtained at the a follow-up visit), in order to obtain an updated model with better accuracy. This can take care of incomplete longitudinal data due to patient drop-off, because it transfers the old- domain model not the data. In Aim #3 we will conduct validation for the proposed models using the MCI data collected by Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for all phases of AD. The current project is novel in creating a first-of-its-kind clinically-feasible technology for personalized MCI diagnostics and prognostics as well as in using “multitask learning” and “transfer learning” machine learning methods for modeling cross-sectionally and longitudinally incomplete multi-modality data. It is innovative in using multitask learning to model incomplete cross-sectional data (e.g., baseline data) and using transfer learning to model the incomplete longitudinal data. Project Narrative The project will develop a clinically-feasible system for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) diagnostics and prognostics, by integrating multi-modality imaging data such as MRI and PET as well as non-imaging data such as clinical assessments, biomarkers, demographics, and genetic information. Successful development of this system can help overcome several limitations in existing methods, and help address the current and growing public health concern regarding Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) affecting over 5 millions people in US.",Multi-Modality Image Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approaches for Personalized Diagnostics and Prognostics of MCI due to AD,9254700,R41AG053149,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Equipment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'follow-up', 'genetic information', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'tool']",NIA,MS TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION,R41,2016,149936,0.14094049857578056
"Quantifying Brain Abnormality by Multimodality Neuroimage Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries.

"Multi-modal Prediction of Future Clinical Dementia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The process of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is thought to begin years before symptoms. This ""preclinical"" phase, characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation consistent with AD, holds the key to identifying causes and developing therapeutic strategies. In the absence of sensitive and specific behavioral/cognitive tests, quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests will be critical for stratified medicine in preclinical AD. This project will examine two high-dimensional data modalities, namely structural brain MRI scans and genome-wide SNP data, in order to derive tools to compute individual-level predictions about future dementia onset. AD imprints a unique atrophy signature on the brain discernable in structural MRI scans. Converging data suggest that AD-associated atrophy is detectable years before clinical symptoms. The machine learning (or pattern analysis) approach, which our laboratory has advocated in neuroimage analysis, offers highly sensitive and specific atrophy detectors. We hypothesize these tools will be invaluable for identifying preclinical AD subjects who are at increased risk of dementia onset. Late-onset AD (LOAD), which represents >95% of all AD cases, is up to 70% heritable. In addition to APOE4, the major genetic risk factor, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a growing list of other common genetic variants associated with LOAD. The complexity of LOAD's genetic underpinnings suggests that sophisticated models that aggregate data across the genome might help us explain some of the variability in disease progression. Developing such models using state-of-the-art machine learning technology and leveraging already-collected large-scale datasets is one of our main aims in this proposal. The proposed project will build on the principal investigator's (Sabuncu) strong background in computational modeling and machine learning to conduct analyses using cutting-edge methods on large-scale data. We will use multi-modal data, including neuroimaging and GWAS data, to develop and validate models that predict future decline in preclinical LOAD. Our method of choice will be a novel Bayesian ML algorithm, specifically designed for longitudinal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternatives (constructed by discriminating cases and controls) for identifying ""amyloid positive"" individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a multi-level approach for discovery and validation and a multi-modal strategy to test our hypothesis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thanks to recent technological advances we can now reliably detect Alzheimer's pathology in individuals during the preclinical phase, which can last years before symptoms begin. Yet we lack the tools to predict the course of these preclinical individuals, many of which progress to dementia quite quickly, while others remain asymptomatic. The proposed project will leverage large- scale datasets such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and sophisticated data mining techniques to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on multi-modal data, including genetic markers and MRI scans.        ",Multi-modal Prediction of Future Clinical Dementia,9033273,R21AG050122,"['Adverse effects', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Atrophic', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Boxing', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Disease Progression', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'amyloid pathology', 'base', 'case control', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'detector', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imprint', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'tau Proteins', 'tool']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2016,256500,0.16883525575607167
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9272127,UH2NS100599,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Microscopic', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Public Health', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sclerosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'White Matter Disease', 'advanced dementia', 'age related', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'treatment response']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2016,1111944,0.09357514952780385
"Mobile Application to Deliver Personalized Nutrition for the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease Genben Lifesciences (dba GB HealthWatch) is a digital health and nutritional genomics company. Our mission is to help fight common, diet- and lifestyle-related chronic diseases with precision nutrition and advanced mobile technologies. Our company developed the HealthWatch 360 mobile app for tracking dietary intake, physical activity and health-related symptoms. This mobile app has received excellent reviews for both the iOS and Android platforms and has over 70,000 registered users. Health condition- specific goals featured in the app provide refined nutritional recommendations based on clinical guidelines for the prevention of diet-induced, chronic diseases. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the U.S., the 6th leading cause of mortality and a major cost to the nation, families and caregivers. This phase I proposal is for the development of a mobile tool that will deliver personalized nutrition and meal plans based on genetic risk in order to mitigate AD risk. Aim 1: Develop a systematic process to identify specific dietary and nutritional components associated with AD. Using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 database and nutritional analyses of the traditional diets that correspond with the 26 populations, we will analyze whether specific nutrients correlate with the frequency of genetic variants that predispose risk of AD. We hypothesize that a population’s fitness would be enhanced and AD risk would be lower when the genetic variants that are selected for in a given population are in equilibrium with a diet that is enriched or depleted with the correlated nutrient(s). We will develop statistical models that will quantify these relationships. Aim 2: Translate nutritional patterns to a set of quantitative recommendations for AD prevention. With the nutrient data we obtain from Aim 1, combined with other evidence-based nutrition guidelines for AD, we will synthesize a set of qualitative and quantitative nutritional “rules” based on the app user’s genotypes, family history of AD and other health conditions. These genotype- and/or phenotype - specific rules will estimate ideal ranges for a given nutrient and amend the conventional “rules” (i.e. nutritional recommendations) by the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for America. Aim 3: Mobile app for delivery of personalized meal plan for the prevention of AD. This mobile application is designed for guided, proactive and self-executed prevention of AD, and targeted at those who are at elevated risk. We propose developing machine-learning algorithms to create meal plans that employ the modified nutrient ranges (from Aims 1 and 2) for a given AD risk genotype. Users will be able to modify food preference parameters (for example, “vegetarian”) while maintaining the appropriate nutrient ranges. A key outcome of this project will be a platform that supports population-wide dietary intervention by seamlessly connecting preventive healthcare with daily life in the digital age. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia in the US with over 5 million people suffering from this neurodegenerative disease. Aside from those actually suffering with Alzheimer’s, this devastating disease takes an enormous toll on families and caregivers and is estimated to cost over $200 billion in the US alone. The exact cause of Alzheimer’s disease is still being studied but there is a significant genetic component, with APOE alleles most strongly predictive. Nonetheless, diet and lifestyle interventions have been shown to mitigate Alzheimer’s risk even in those with APOE risk allele(s). Alzheimer’s pathology begins decades before symptoms appear and therefore making dietary and lifestyle changes earlier in life would be a cost-effective means of preventing disease later in life. This proposal aims to develop a low-cost, evidence-based, mobile app that delivers personalized nutritional recommendations in the form of meal plans to those with genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease.",Mobile Application to Deliver Personalized Nutrition for the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease,9254310,R43AG055203,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Americas', 'Android', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family history of', 'Food Preferences', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Mission', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention Guidelines', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Translating', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'fighting', 'fitness', 'genetic variant', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'nutrition', 'nutritional genomics', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIA,GENBEN LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION,R43,2016,205473,0.20733475080269093
"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High-Order Brain Networks Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High- Order Brain Networks Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with no known disease-modifying treatment. Current clinical diagnosis and monitoring of the disease are primarily based on subjective neuropsychological and neurobehavioral assessments, which are generally susceptible to large variability. Objective biomarkers that are sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis and monitoring purposes are hence critically in need. Neuroimaging fits this need and provides objective measures and markers of preclinical disease states for aiding researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitoring their effectiveness. Since AD- related neurological degeneration occurs long before the appearance of clinical symptomatology, additional diagnostic information during the prodromal phase of AD, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is of paramount importance for the success of treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning diagnostic framework based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) for accurate AD diagnosis at the individual level, so as to promote early detection for possible treatment and prophylaxis. Achieving this goal requires significant technical innovations to empower researchers the ability to detect sophisticated yet subtle alteration patterns in brain function. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will harness the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity to provide additional information for accurate identification of individuals who are at risk for AD. This is significantly different from most existing methods that assume temporal stationarity and are therefore unable to take advantage of temporally-evolving connectivity information for more fine-grained characterization of rapidly changing brain states. In Aim 2, we will extract high-order information from functional networks, beyond the commonly used region-pair correlation, for characterizing functional synchronization of the interactions of multiple pairs of regions. This overcomes the over-simplistic pairwise-interaction assumptions of existing methods, and thus allows greater capacity to model complex brain circuitry. In Aim 3, we will fuse information across imaging modalities to complement functional networks with both the white-matter structural networks (generated using diffusion MRI) and the morphological networks (generated using cortical thickness information from anatomical T1-weighted imaging). This will allow complementary information from different modalities to reinforce each other in improving diagnostic accuracy. Upon successful completion of this project, we expect that the resulting comprehensive, integrated, and effective diagnosis framework will be conducive to improving the success of early detection of MCI/AD, as well as other neurological disorders including schizophrenia, autism, and multiple sclerosis.  Narrative Description of Project AD-related neurological degeneration occurs long before the appearance of clinical symptomatology.

"Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer Disease (AD), and the existing studies have suggested that the individuals with amnestic MCI tend to progress to probable AD at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year. Early prediction of MCI patients with high risk of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Recent advances in acquiring multi-dimensional and longitudinal brain imaging and genome-wide array data provide exciting new opportunities to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. Integrating such multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data holds great promise for a system biology of the brain to better understand the complex neurobiological mechanism of conversion of MCI to AD. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these neuroimaging genomic data sets have presented critical computational challenges for achieving the full transformative potential from comprehensive joint analysis of these heterogeneous and longitudinal data sets. This project aims to address these emerging challenges for early prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion with four aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel sparse bi-multivariate learning model based system biology framework for analysis of genome-wide association results across a large number of the structural and functional phenotypes derived from neuroimaging scans of the whole brain. Our new methods are designed for bi-multivariate analysis of high-throughput genomic data and complex Quantitative Traits (QTs) related to MCI-to-AD conversion by utilizing the system biology knowledge. Aim 2 is to further extend the learning approaches in Aim 1 with the new structured sparse models to the multi-dimensional data integration methods to identify the heterogeneous biomarkers from multiscale interrelated imaging genomic data for outcome prediction. Meanwhile, we will utilize the joint multi-task learning scheme to identify the stable genetic and phenotypic biomarkers that are associated with cognitive functions decline and MCI-to-AD conversion simultaneously. Based on the studies in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 is focused on revealing the longitudinal biomarkers of the changes of MCI progression or cognitive impairment by a new structured low-rank multi-task regression model. These biomarkers can fully differentiate longitudinal profiles of relevant QTs and better capture genetic associations with QT changes over time. Aim 4 is to evaluate and validate our proposed machine learning and bioinformatics algorithms on both synthetic data and real imaging genomic data. The results of this project will be able to efficiently improve our understanding of the complex neurobiological mechanism underlying the MCI-to-AD conversion. The identified biomarkers will finally enhance the early and accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion such that the clinical treatment can be provided in time. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Existing research works mainly focus on the studies using single genetic or neuroimaging data source and seldom consider the longitudinal data profiles. To address these limitations, this project focuses on 1) the development of novel bioinformatics and machine learning models for solving the computational challenges of analyzing the emerging multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data, and 2) identification of biomarkers with prediction power on MCI-to-AD conversion from the large and complex heterogeneous imaging genomic data with the comprehensive system biology knowledge guidance.",Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction,9131607,R01AG049371,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'case control', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'rate of change', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ARLINGTON,R01,2016,394966,0.1891014609949589
"The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD Project Summary Improving vascular health for delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is identified as a critical goal by the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Conference, the 2015 NIA AD Summit and PAR-15-356 (to which this application is responding). Yet, critical barriers exist to implementing vascular prevention strategies for AD, and elucidating the role of midlife metabolic, macro- and micro- vascular factors in AD is essential to addressing these barriers. Each type of factor may manifest different pathologies in the brain that contribute to dementia sub-types, making a new and sufficiently comprehensive clinical trial a costly and time-consuming undertaking. To address this essential gap, we propose to leverage the rich longitudinal cohort data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study with the addition of detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain neuroimaging – the MESA VASCAD study. MESA participants at the Wake Forest site (46% African-American, 54% non-Hispanic Caucasian) have already undergone extensive metabolic and vascular phenotyping, repeated retinal imaging and a brief cognitive assessment in 2010-2012. The MESA VASCAD study will add clinical and cognitive assessments (Uniform Data Set and supplemental cognitive tests); neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid PET); and reanalysis of retinal images. We propose to enroll 540 MESA participants in 2 years and repeat assessments 3 years later to more fully characterize targeted, modifiable vascular risk factors for AD. Through our Specific Aims, we will (1) test the hypothesis that baseline macrovascular and microvascular biomarkers in middle-age predict both standard AD neuroimaging outcomes (e.g. hippocampal volume and amyloid deposition assessed with PET) and more novel cerebrovascular biomarkers (e.g. microinfarcts, lacunar infarcts, neurite density and cerebral microbleeds); (2) determine if changes in metabolic and vascular biomarkers over 15 years predict cognitive and AD biomarker trajectory; and (3) using high-dimensional machine learning approaches, determine common, differential and interactive metabolic and vascular risk factor profiles among racial and APOE genotype groups. This proposed ancillary study, approved by the MESA Steering Committee, is led by a New Investigator with an experienced, multi- disciplinary team of collaborators. The MESA study is an ideal cohort for interrogating the questions in this proposal: it has highly detailed longitudinal risk factor data collected over 15+ years in a diverse cohort, which we can leverage and augment with cerebrovascular biomarkers, AD biomarkers, and cognitive reassessments - thereby creating a comprehensive brain phenotype dataset for vascular and AD risk factors. These new data will enable us to examine the timing and impact of vascular biomarkers on dementia biomarkers and cognitive trajectories before a diagnosis of pre-clinical and clinical AD-related disorders, meeting a critical gap in information that will help guide the development of novel therapeutic or prevention strategies for various forms of AD-related dementias. Project Narrative Vascular and metabolic disorders are proposed as potent modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and may provide key routes for therapeutic and preventive interventions. We propose to leverage the vast resources of the NIH-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study to examine the potential contributions of macrovascular and microvascular subclinical disease to AD-related pathology. At the Wake Forest MESA site, we will add neuroimaging, repeated cognitive testing, and reprocessing of existing digital retinal scans with novel measures of retinal microvascular architecture.",The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD,9194701,R01AG054069,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Ancillary Study', 'Architecture', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Caliber', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coronary', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Neurites', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Route', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vascular Diseases', 'adjudicate', 'age related', 'arterial stiffness', 'brain health', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'density', 'digital', 'epigenetic marker', 'experience', 'falls', 'forest', 'improved', 'macrovascular disease', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'modifiable risk', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pre-clinical', 'resilience', 'response', 'screening', 'symposium', 'vascular contributions', 'vascular factor', 'vascular risk factor']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,791918,0.22363353595597946
"Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in  Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline. These objectives are directly relevant to the global effort to halt AD via early detection of cognitively-healthy persons at high  risk for progressing to AD. This is because current national guidelines for detecting risk for AD i asymptomatic persons call for extensive evaluations (e.g., nuclear imaging and lumbar puncture) that are expensive, not always well-tolerated by research volunteers and, more importantly, not widely available. In contrast, this project will rigorously assess brain changes i Stage 3 preclinical AD using routine, non-invasive, and broadly-deployable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain structure and blood flow. A specific deliverable of this project is the derivation of a single, quantitative, abnormality score that can be used-in combination with pertinent health information-for identifying, on an individual level, asymptomatic persons at heightened risk for AD. Such persons may then benefit from more extensive AD biomarker testing, closer monitoring, and treatment with disease-modifying drugs when such drugs become available. The project's success has material potential to significantly extend the public health reach of the proposed guidelines for defining preclinical AD. The three specific aims addressed in this project are: (1) specify the pattern of brain changes on MRI that is characteristic of Stage 3 preclinical AD, (2) prospectively assess the prognostic utility of an aggregate measure of midlife structural-functional MRI brain changes, and (3) preliminarily evaluate how individual differences related to cognitive reserve and genetic risk modify the association between early brain changes and future decline. Completion of the interrelated set of research and training activities proposed in this K23 will greatly foster the candidate's development into an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in conducting translational and multidisciplinary neuroimaging studies of preclinical AD.

"MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application of the MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia compares which of 3 approaches for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is best at accurately predicting incident clinical dementia. Of the two primary diagnostic methods currently used, psychometrically defined and clinical determined, application of criteria for psychometrically defined has been most variable. Further, a novel algorithmic method is emerging as an alternative unbiased approach. Using commonly applied clinical tools of cognitive performance and brain structure obtained from baseline and repeat administration of neuropsychological (NP) tests and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans, this proposed project will first determine what profile of cross-sectional or longitudinal neuropsychological tests and threshold performance levels, combined with imaging markers is the most efficacious in predicting progression to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Another set of analyses will test the algorithmic method. The diagnostic models that emerge from these two sets of analyses will then be compared to diagnoses of MCI using standard clinical criteria to determine which of the three methods best predicts incident dementia. The clinical diagnoses of MCI and dementia are available through a separately funded initiative. Also central to this grant proposal is the inclusion of external seasoned investigators, who will provid their expertise in definition and study of MCI and the factors influencing progression to disease. This effort aims to provide enhanced sensitivity in application of NP and MRI tools to detect subtle impairment at an earlier stage on the preclinical continuum and improved specificity in determining the MCI subtypes most highly associated with AD versus other types of dementia. Increased MCI diagnostic accuracy will enhance opportunity for more effective interventions, which have been largely disappointing to date, and could eventually leading to a delay in the onset or prevention of the clinical expression of AD. The MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia seeks to identify the most effective method and criteria for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is best predictive of incident Alzheimer's disease. Current efforts to treat AD have been ineffective because intervention occurs too late in the insidious process. The potential public health relevance of this proposed project is increased accuracy of diagnosis at the preclinical stage, where treatment opportunities may prove to be more successful and prevention is most feasible.","MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia",9087082,R01AG016495,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Etiology', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seasons', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Vascular Dementia', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective intervention', 'entorhinal cortex', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2016,634478,0.1292964472809365
"Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people worldwide. Due to the fact that the longitudinal abnormality associated with AD can be detected in vivo, neuroimaging measures have been playing an increasingly important role in searching for biomarkers of AD that can be used for early diagnosis, progression monitoring, and therapy responses measurement. The goal of this project is to create a set of cutting-edge computational tools for identifying very early biomarkers of AD and alert AD progression via longitudinal image analysis. The key to achieve high sensitivity and specificity AD diagnosis of individuals is the stable longitudinal measurements. In light of this, the candidate will first develop a novel learning-based 4D (3D+t) landmark detector (Aim 1) to find the landmark locations at all time points simultaneously. The trajectories of landmark set form a compact 4D shape representation to achieve temporal consistency in registering longitudinal image sequence to the template (Aim 2). As a result, the consistency of low level features extracted from MR or PET images can be significantly improved. Since the subject-specific patterns of structural/functional changes, although more relevant to AD diagnosis of individuals, is very subtle compared to huge variation across subjects, the candidate will further develop a supervised deep neural network to learn the latent high-level spatial-temporal patterns by coupled stacked auto-encoder and temporal max pooling (Aim 2). The learned spatial-temporal morphological patterns consist of (1) cross- sectional features from MR and PET images, and (2) dynamic short/long term longitudinal patterns w.r.t. different number of historical time points. In a clinical setting, not all patients have a large and complete set of neuroimaging data, or an equal number of imaging scans. In order to eventually translate to clinic arena, a novel AD detector that uses a spatial-temporal hyper-graph learning framework (Aim 3) is proposed to not only provide high sensitivity and specificity in AD diagnosis but also solve the above difficulties. To evaluate the diagnostic value, we will apply our trained AD detector to ADNI dataset and patient data collected in UNC (Aim 3). Finally, we will package all our developed methods into a software package and release it freely to the neuroimaging community, to facilitate other AD-biomarker-exploration projects performed in other institutes. Project Narrative This proposal aims for the development of novel neuroimaging analysis methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal image data. In particular, a set of automated algorithms will be created to aid the difficult task of analyzing subtle and complex morphological change patterns of Alzheimer's disease during the disease progression. The successful completion of this project will represent an import milestone in neuroimaging research by bringing forth the fruition of a powerful and practical system for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at individual level, for potential effective treatment.",Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,9179821,K01AG049089,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'computerized tools', 'detector', 'disease diagnosis', 'economic cost', 'effective therapy', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'functional loss', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'social', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2016,126929,0.2173188403503302
"Regional Neurotoxicity & Early Biomarkers of Air Pollution Effects on Brain Aging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more women than men and burdens millions of aging Americans and their families. While our knowledge of modifiable risk factors for AD remains limited, there is growing evidence that exposure to ambient air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) and ozone, accelerates brain aging. Built on our collaborative work on neurotoxic effects of ambient air pollution and cognitive aging in Women's Health Initiative Study (WHIMS), this application will address two critical knowledge gaps in this promising area of air pollution-neuroepidemiology: (1) It is unclear whether brain region- and/or site-specific neurotoxicity occurs from ambient air pollution exposure; and (2) Strong epidemiologic evidence linking ambient air pollution to increased AD risk are still lacking. These knowledge gaps reflect limitations of previous research with conventional analyses of neuroimaging data and insufficient power in linking AD risk with exposures. This application will overcome these challenges by combing three unique data sources (WHIMS air pollution exposure; WHIMS MRI; and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI]). Leveraging the longitudinal brain structure data from WHIMS MRI (gathered in 2005-6; 2010-2011) plus air pollution exposure estimates generated for WHIMS (gathered in 1993-2010), we will apply high-dimensional computational methods to conduct voxel-based analyses with a systematic and agnostic approach to examining the brain region-specific neurotoxicity of air pollution. This exploratory R21 application will also test the hypothesized adverse effect of ambient air pollution on the pattern of brain structure predictive of increased AD risk in an optimal population context, where ambient air pollutants affected the cognitive aging in older women. ADNI provides a well-characterized clinical database of cognitive normal and AD phenotypes, enabling our development/validation of novel AD risk metrics based on neuroimaging data applicable to WHIMS MRI. Thus, our Specific Aims are: Aim 1) Using structural brain MRI and air pollution data from the WHIMS-MRI cohort, to examine whether spatial patterns of grey matter/white matter atrophy at baseline and their changes over time are associated with air pollutant exposures; and Aim 2) Using novel metrics of AD risk to conduct a quantitative assessment linking AD risk with ambient air pollution. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with complementary expertise in high-dimensional machining learning for neuroimaging data analyses, cognitive aging, and air pollution neurotoxicology/epidemiology. Our study will advance the field of environmental epidemiology of aging by using advanced analytical tools to link air pollution exposures to spatial patterns of brain structure and the predicted risk of AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Long-term exposure to air pollutants may adversely impact the cognitive health of older individuals, however this link is not well-established and whether this conveys an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease is unknown. Leveraging brain magnetic resonance imaging data collected at geographically dispersed US sites and geocoded estimates of person-specific long-term environmental exposures, we will use sophisticated machine learning methods to characterize associations that exposure to air pollution has with brain structure and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determining the nature and extent of these relationships, and their consistency across subgroups of older women, we will identify targets towards improving the health of seniors.",Regional Neurotoxicity & Early Biomarkers of Air Pollution Effects on Brain Aging,9130087,R21AG051113,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurotoxins', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Ozone', 'Particulate Matter', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aging brain', 'ambient air pollution', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'older women', 'particle', 'white matter']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,197236,0.15381096729646013
"Manifold-valued statistical models for longitudinal morphometic analysis in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) Project Summary The ability to quantitatively characterize incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in its preclinical stage is a critical step for early interventions involving disease modifying therapy and for designing efficient clinical trials to test therapy efficacy. This project focuses on deriving statistical image analysis methods for identifying the relationship of morphometric changes in this early stage with direct indicators of AD pathology (such as amyloid deposition) and various risk factors such as family history in late midlife adults who are cognitively healthy. The proposed analysis will be conducted on the largest preclinical AD cohort assembled to date and help elucidate how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals at risk for AD. The core of our analyses is a set of algorithms that allow operating directly on powerful “manifold-valued” representations of morphometric change and consequently yield high sensitivity in picking up real but statistically weak multi-modal patterns of the disease process. Hypothesis: 1) Detecting precise associations between morphometric changes in preclinical AD subjects with amyloid burden and various risk factors is possible using new algorithms that work directly with representations of the Jacobians of the deformation fields derived from longitudinal imaging data. 2) Conducting such analyses on a large multi-site cohort of asymptomatic at-risk preclinical AD individuals with identified AD pathology will a) reveal important insights into early disease processes when dementia is 15+ years away, b) provide preclinical AD biomarkers and c) provide frameworks for predicting clinical endpoints at the level of individual subjects. Specific Aims: 1) To develop new algorithms for performing statistical analysis of manifold representations of morphometric changes concurrently with multiple covariates representing risk factors, AD pathology markers, and clinical/cognitive measures. 2) Conducting an end-to-end analysis of two independent preclinical AD cohorts to identify the relationship of morphometric changes with various predictors as well as test/retest validation across sites. 3) Analyzing the largest preclinical AD cohort to date for characterizing the relationship of the entire spectrum of predictors to clinical endpoints for late midlife individuals. 4) Providing industry- strength open-source software implementing the full suite of models, integrated with existing software toolboxes, for deployments on a workstation, a high throughput cluster or the cloud. Significance: This project will have a significant impact across three distinct areas of brain imaging research: 1) characterization of how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals in the earliest stages of AD, 2) rigorous algorithms for morphometric change analysis in neuroimaging and neuroscience, 3) open-source end-to-end implementations of the algorithms for use within the community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project will develop novel statistical image analysis methods to characterize complex morphological brain changes in healthy individuals who are at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also have some evidence of AD related pathology. Studying and quantifying the evolution of early disease processes in late midlife adults (who are cognitively healthy) on the largest “preclinical” AD cohorts assembled to date will yield frameworks that tie such disease patterns to precise clinical endpoints, such as cognitive decline. These preclinical AD biomarkers have direct applications in a) design of clinical trials for new therapies and b) eventual translation to clinical practice.",Manifold-valued statistical models for longitudinal morphometic analysis in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD),9170619,R01EB022883,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Area', 'Beryllium', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'direct application', 'disease phenotype', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'pre-clinical', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tau Proteins', 'therapy design', 'user friendly software', 'web interface']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,331530,0.2757801065433754
"The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD The goal of this ongoing R01 is to chart the progression of pathobiologic markers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their effect on neural function and cognition in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with risk for AD. There is an appreciable gap in knowledge about the temporal disease course in this age range that this ongoing project has been directly addressing with serial multimodal imaging including amyloid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, and serial cognitive measurement. In the next funding cycle we will add a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique sensitive to fibrillar tau [F-18]THK5351 indexing neurofibrillary pathology. In the prior funding period we recruited 179 individuals from a registry of 1,545 people at risk for AD known as WRAP (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention). We found that [C-11]PIB amyloid burden is detectable in 20% of people with parental history of AD at a mean age of 60. Baseline amyloid is more extensive in the presence of higher CSF total tau levels, and 2-year increases in PiB amyloid are significantly predicted by higher baseline CSF tau. The hypothesis for this renewal is that tau- related neurofibrillar pathology begins early (in accord with the neuropathology literature) in people at AD risk and its strategic spatial burden explains changes in amyloid, neural function and cognitive decline. Aim 1: To test the premise that amyloid burden is necessary but not sufficient to evoke preclinical cognitive change. We will examine effects of longitudinal amyloid and tau change on episodic memory trajectories over time in 235 at risk individuals including all subjects we previously enrolled and follow them over 2 years with advanced multimodal imaging and CSF. Aim 2: To assess the effects of tau and amyloid imaging on MRI and CSF indicators of neural injury and function. Aim 3: To develop a multimodal disease marker to maximize efficiency of clinical trials in preclinical AD. Following our work in creating tools for efficient clinical trials in MCI, we will extend these concepts to the pre-MCI phase of disease utilizing deep learning architectures with tau, amyloid and structural imaging inputs. We will also examine change over time in tau, amyloid and cognition as outcomes. As any of these features considered singularly may be affected by age, and as amyloid and tau may be `necessary but not sufficient' by themselves, a derived multimodal marker may have eventual clinical utility in enriching prevention trials with those most likely to progress, and increasing power to detect change attributable to preclinical interventions. Significance: Relative tau and amyloid imaging profiles have not been empirically established in the presymptomatic time frame and this information is urgently needed to identify incipient disease. No comparable studies exist regarding the evolution of tau and amyloid signal in the critical late-middle-age time frame of preclinical AD. This ongoing project represents a unique opportunity to examine the earliest determinants of AD progression, when treatments may be most meaningful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/ NARRATIVE Identifying the earliest neuropathological features of AD including tau and amyloid pathology will improve early detection and inform clinical trials in the presymptomatic time frame. This project will examine these features with advanced imaging methods in a cohort at risk for AD who are largely asymptomatic. An outgrowth of the project will be information about the rate of change in AD pathology which can help us plan clinical trials in this population using derived outcomes about the brain itself, thereby reducing the number of subjects needed in a trial and increasing sensitivity to detecting change.",The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD,9192264,R01AG021155,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Memory Loss', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention trial', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Semantic memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'amyloid pathology', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'cost', 'entorhinal cortex', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'nerve injury', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,1441399,0.2175878964403022
"A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials PROJECT SUMMARY It is our hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous conditions and, therefore, a paradigm shift is required to identify specific subpopulations for targeted interventions. This approach has generated significant success in other complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. A key opportunity in this context is the identification of those most likely to benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs and other anti-inflammatory compounds. The relation between inflammation and the development of AD, MCI, and cognitive decline has received a great deal of attention with basic science and observational human studies demonstrating a protective effect against cognitive loss. Likewise, in our work, inflammation has been a key mechanism in the biological profile that is indicative of disease presence. Based on a wealth of literature (epidemiological, cross-sectional, pathobiological and animal model), multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the utility of NSAID compounds in treating or preventing AD (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study [ADCS] AD and MCI anti-inflammatory trials; Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial [ADAPT]); however, each of these studies failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit, in fact some patients may have exhibited worsening cognitive performance with treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that particular subsets of patients in these trials did benefit from treatment and that our blood-based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify both positive and adverse responders within these trials. Here we propose to leverage three previously conducted clinical trials to test our hypothesis that our blood- based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify the subsets of patients who benefited from these previously conducted clinical trials. By conducting proteomic assays from existing biorepositories from the ADCS and ADAPT, we will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate the utility of the proinflammatory endophenotype as a means for patient selection into NSAID therapy for treating and preventing AD; Specific Aim 2. To determine if change in proinflammatory endophenotype scores over time is a biomarker of therapeutic response. By leveraging a highly innovative method and substantial existing resources, the current project addresses a significant need in the search for novel approaches AD therapeutics. The significance of the current project is the identification of a specific subset of patients who will experience clinically significant cognitive benefit from administration of NSAID medication. If successful, the current project will set the stage for a novel clinical trial that enrolls patients specifically based on baseline proinflammatory endophenotype scores for administration of NSAID therapy. In the long-term, this line of research is designed to build a person-centered (i.e. personalized) approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's diseases are a growing public health crisis impacting millions of elders world-wide with a health care cost greater than cancer and equivalent to cardiovascular disease. Current treatments only slow progression of the disease and new strategies are urgently needed. The relevance of the current project is the validation of a person-centered approach to treating Alzheimer's disease by identifying specific subgroups that are most likely to respond to targeted therapies. The outcomes of this project will fundamentally change the approach to the search for novel therapies for AD from the “one-size-fits-all” approach to the search for specific subgroups that can be treated with targeted medications.",A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials,9177291,R01AG051848,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'IL18 gene', 'IL5 gene', 'IL6 gene', 'IL7 gene', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-10', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Naproxen', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Prevention trial', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'arm', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'response', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R01,2016,742047,0.1681821278576562
"CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder. Inflammatory changes in the brain are thought to represent key processes in the onset and progression of AD, but it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation confers neuroprotection, accelerated degeneration, or possibly both. Such an understanding in living humans is critical if we are to begin clinical trials using the array of FDA-approved immunomodulatory drugs in the future. We propose that complement- mediated neuroinflammation is protective in the early AD stages, while suppression of complement activities is accompanied by the development of greater cognitive deficits and faster cognitive decline. Our preliminary data from multiple cohorts support this hypothesis by showing 1) reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement-related markers occur in the dementia stage but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD; 2) reduced CSF complement-related markers and elevated CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with faster decline in AD; and 3) CSF inflammatory protein alterations reveal networks of cellular and protein regulations. In the In the current application, we will build on the association between complement related proteins and rates of cognitive decline in AD to identify associated changes in soluble CSF cytokines and chemokines, differential inflammatory cell type regulation, and imaging correlates of neuroinflammation. This application takes advantage of our group’s strengths in performing CSF cytokine measurements, CSF immunophenotyping, molecular imaging of neuroinflammation through positron emission tomography (PET) and iron-enhanced MRI, and network analysis through a novel biochemical-bioinformatics pipeline. We will directly identify individual and networks of soluble CSF cytokines that accompany the transition from the MCI to the dementia stage of AD, correlate the complement and other altered pathways with microglial activation through two modern PET tracers (11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA), and measure changes in individual T helper cell (type 1, 2, 17) and non-T cell populations. This application represents the first attempt to correlate, at the individual level and at the group level, CSF and imaging measures of neuroinflammation. If successful, this application will advance the understanding of neuroinflammation in AD through parallel approaches, form the basis of a new biomarker panel (and algorithm) to diagnose AD through a combination of degenerative and inflammatory markers, and accelerate the target identification of future therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system in AD. Brain inflammation is a key event in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but it is not clear whether it is harmful, protective, or both. The current proposal aims to confirm our finding that a switch from the protective to harmful type of inflammation predicts more severe symptoms and faster progression in Alzheimer’s disease, and we can identify people with the protective and harmful inflammation by studying the cerebrospinal fluid (circulating proteins and cells) and brain imaging (PET and MRI scans).","CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease",9194839,R01AG054046,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement Suppression', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Encephalitis', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fractalkine', 'Future', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune system', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-7', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Phagocytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Th1 Cells', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'brain dysfunction', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'demographics', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'iron oxide', 'macrophage', 'migration', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'neuroprotection', 'novel']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,770283,0.20402257234873727
"Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a prospective, community-based 3-generational study that enrolled participants between ages 20-50 and has examined them every 2-4 years to collect extensive lifestyle, vascular, biomarker data; 9300 have GWAS. Embedded in this cohort are 1036 multigenerational families. Surveillance for AD dementia (and MCI) has been ongoing for over 4 decades. We have identified 1421 incident AD, 1767 MCI, enrolled 800+ in a brain donation program, obtained 7000+ 1.5T brain MRI, and repeated, detailed neuropsychological assessments. We have recently obtained extensive omics in ~6000 (gene expression, methylation, miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics) and genomics (50X whole genome sequences [WGS] in 4197 with pedigree-based imputation to 6554) through the NHLBI funded SABRe CVD (omics) and TOPMed (WGS) programs. We seek to leverage these rich resources (>$25 million). We propose these specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain temporal trends in clinical AD dementia in the FHS cohorts. The age-specific incidence of dementia has declined over the past 4 decades among FHS participants (in press). However, the reasons for this decline remain unclear. We thus propose to continue tracking temporal trends in AD dementia and MCI through intensive surveillance, and verifying diagnoses at autopsy. We hypothesize that better education, treatment of some vascular factors and protective lifestyle changes (diet, activity, social engagement) may partially explain these trends. AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention. Whereas the total number of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages, we have 4 decades of Framingham data suggesting that the risk at any given age is declining. We plan to study the reasons for this hopeful trend in detail through continuing our surveillance for dementia and cognitive impairment, collecting cutting edge brain imaging (amyloid and tau-PET, volumes, connectivity and perfusion on MRI) in the dementia-free (preclinical AD), and using sophisticated analysis of very extensive genetic and omic data already collected on Framingham subjects. This could help us better understand AD trends and biology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.   ","Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts",9194741,R01AG054076,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drops', 'Drug Targeting', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Family', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Social Network', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'base', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'good diet', 'grandparent', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'social', 'targeted biomarker', 'tau Proteins', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend', 'vascular factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2016,2322345,0.26700957105653655
"Maximizing Power in AD Clinical Trials via Multimodal Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An emphasis in ongoing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is identifying those biomarkers which best predict future cognitive decline at the various stages of disease progression. These biomarkers can then serve as early markers for diagnosis, and for selection of subjects into clinical trials. Recent results suggest that the identification of such discriminative biomarkers is possible by adapting machine learning methods for this problem: but studies have primarily used modalities in isolation so far. The sensitivity/specificity offered by these methods is unsatisfactory for more clinically relevant questions: which MCI patients will convert to AD? Answering such questions requires new methods that leverage all data sources (e.g., imaging modalities, CSF measures) in conjunction. This project focuses on how data from multiple biomarkers should be optimally aggregated to best predict future cognitive decline, and how these models can improve clinical trials for AD. Hypothesis: Significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity for discriminating AD, MCI, and healthy controls at the level of individual subjects are possible by making use of multiple modalities (together with longitudinal data) simultaneously. Further, these methods will significantly improve sample size estimates in clinical trials, and help derive customized outcomes for evaluating new treatment procedures. Specific Aims: (1) To develop new image-based machine learning algorithms that can take advantage of multiple modalities simultaneously within a unified framework. (2) To provide a software and extensively evaluate these methods on the ADNI and BLSA datasets, to assess the sensitivity/specificity attainable by truly multi-modal analysis methods. (3) To interface multi-modal classification methods with AD clinical trials: (a) by developing comprehensive sample size estimates needed to observe specific outcomes, and using these methods to derive customized outcomes for an ongoing R01-funded observational/prospective study here at the Wisconsin ADRC. Methods: We will develop new multi-modal machine learning methods that will optimally exploit all data sources simultaneously. Our models will also incorporate longitudinal data, and exploit interaction between modalities at different stages of the disease. This will be used to derive a Multi-Modal Disease Marker (MMDM) (Aim 1). The algorithms will be evaluated on large-scale well-characterized datasets and provided as software tools (Aim 2). We will use these models to improve AD clinical trials in two ways: by sample enrichment and customized outcomes that provide maximum statistical power to detect treatment effects (Aim 3). Significance: This project capitalizes on the Wisconsin ADRC's expertise in machine learning, statistical clinical trial design, imaging, and clinical diagnosis of AD and pre-AD conditions. This project will be the first to implement a multi-modal machine learning metric specifically designed to speed up clinical trials so that potential therapies can be evaluated and an effective treatment arrived at as quickly as possible. This project will develop novel methods and software systems for highly accurate and automated identification of patterns related to Alzheimer's disease. The techniques will take advantage of the aggregate information from an individual's brain images from multiple imaging modalities such as structural images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance) and functional images (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography), as well as cognitive and demographic information. The software, as a result of successful completion of this project, will provide invaluable assistance in AD diagnosis (and predicting cognitive decline) at the level of individual subjects, as well as allow clinical experiments to be more effective in evaluating which drugs and treatments are effective for such neurological disorders.",Maximizing Power in AD Clinical Trials via Multimodal Machine Learning,8893852,R01AG040396,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subjects Selections', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Wisconsin', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'prospective', 'research study', 'software repository', 'software systems', 'treatment effect']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,269342,0.18571162630980428
"A machine learning approach to identify Alzheimer's disease therapeutic targets     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this project is to enable the use of molecular profiles (e.g., expression data, genetic data, and proteomic data) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to facilitate to identify therapeutic targets. There is a growing availabilit of expression profiles of brain tissues from AD patients and normal subjects, which holds great promise for improving our molecular-level understanding of AD and developing new drugs. The most important step necessary to realize this goal is to identify molecular features, such as expression levels of certain genes, in these data that are predictive of AD phenotypes indicative of the disease progression, such as neuropathological and clinical phenotypes. Despite the pressing need, due to the high-dimensionality of the expression data, it is an open challenge to identify molecular features that are truly associated with a phenotype. This is a critical barrier that impedes progress in identifying therapeutic targets from high-throughput molecular profiles. To resolve this challenge, this project proposes to identify network-based features representing important molecular events in disease progression from gene expression data, and use the identified features to predict AD-related phenotypes. This approach can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the expression data by focusing on a small subset of genes that are likely relevant to AD. In particular, we focus on the following network-features: perturbed genes that have different connectivity patterns with other genes between different AD stages (Aim 1); hubs that are densely connected with other genes in the inferred network in AD (Aim 2); and common hubs (co-hubs) between AD and cardiovascular disease (Aim 2). In each aim, we will develop powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms that can jointly model interactions of genes that are present in multiple heterogeneous datasets. We will apply the identified network-based features to predict neuropathological and clinical phenotypes in the data from a densely phenotyped cohort in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. The features selected to be predictive of these phenotypes will provide us with better insights into the molecular mechanisms driving AD progression, which can lead to effective therapeutic targets. Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to the discovery of the molecular features that are informative of the disease processes and can thus guide drug development. The proposed research will lay the groundwork of an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, a statistician, basic biologists, a internist and a neuropathologist to develop a systematic computational framework for identifying AD therapeutic targets from heterogeneous molecular and clinical profiles.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to improve our molecular-level understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identify novel therapeutic targets. The growing availability of molecular profiles - such as DNA sequence, epigenetic data, RNA expression data and proteomic data - from AD brain tissues holds great promise to identify molecular features (e.g., expression levels of certain genes) that are informative of the disease processes and can thus guide drug development. We propose an innovative computational framework that integrates heterogeneous datasets for identifying robust molecular features from high-throughput molecular profiles.            ",A machine learning approach to identify Alzheimer's disease therapeutic targets,8806039,R21AG049196,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Internist', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Cell', 'Pathological Staging', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'case control', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder control', 'drug development', 'experience', 'gene interaction', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'therapeutic target']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,228861,0.15808095091054367
"Quantifying Brain Abnormality by Multimodality Neuroimage Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes, afforded by multimodality neuroimaging data, for both diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's diseases (AD).

"Computational neuroanatomy of aging and AD via pattern analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our previous work on computational neuroanatomy of aging, and investigates the use of advanced pattern analysis methods in early detection of imaging phenotypes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD is a disease of rapidly increasing prevalence and clinical significance, in an aging population. Currently available diagnostic tests detect the disease at extremely late stages, perhaps more than a decade after it first begins to develop. A variety of imaging methods offers great promise for the detection of early signs of brain change, which can be indicative of future clinical progression to AD. However structural and functional imaging patterns characteristic of AD are subtle, spatially complex, evolving dynamically with age/time, and are overlaid on changes induced by normal aging. This raises the need for sophisticated methods for image analysis and pattern recognition. Towards this goal, Aim 3 integrates high-dimensional pattern analysis and recognition methods aiming to quantitatively describe imaging patterns that have diagnostic and predictive value. Since these patterns can be spatially complex and subtle, conventional image analysis methods can be challenged. We therefore build on the state of the art of machine learning and pattern recognition, focusing on the major challenge encountered in medical imaging: high dimensionality of imaging data relative to the available sample sizes. Optimal multi-parametric feature construction and dimensionality reduction methods are necessary to meet this challenge and are considered in Aim 2 along with multi-parametric classification and clustering methods. The foundation of the pattern analysis of the work in Aim 3 is also set in Aim 1, which deals with more ""low-level"" fundamental image analysis problem: registration, which is a process that places image data to a standardized coordinate system, thereby enabling statistical analysis of spatio-temporal imaging patterns across healthy and patient populations: an optimal mathematical representation of morphological data is developed via a group-wise registration process. We apply this method to structural, functional and amyloid deposition image data from two of the largest studies of normal aging (BLSA) and AD (ADNI). Alzheimer's Disease poses a major medical and socioeconomic problem, which becomes increasingly prevalent as the population lives longer. This project develops and applies computer methods for multi-parametric analysis of MRI and PET scans, aiming to detect very early markers of the disease. As patterns of brain change are complex, subtle, and occur in tandem with normal changes brought by healthy aging, they are extremely difficult to detect at early stages, during which effective treatments are likely to exist in the near future. Advanced methods for pattern analysis and recognition have shown high promise in terms of measuring and detecting such early changes. This project will contribute such methods to the field. It will also apply them to two of the largest studies of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease: BLSA and ADNI.",Computational neuroanatomy of aging and AD via pattern analysis,8881034,R01AG014971,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Appearance', 'Biochemical', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Residual state', 'Sample Size', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinically significant', 'computational anatomy', 'effective therapy', 'healthy aging', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'patient population', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'socioeconomics', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,342584,0.10106703646195109
"Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer Disease (AD), and the existing studies have suggested that the individuals with amnestic MCI tend to progress to probable AD at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year. Early prediction of MCI patients with high risk of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Recent advances in acquiring multi-dimensional and longitudinal brain imaging and genome-wide array data provide exciting new opportunities to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. Integrating such multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data holds great promise for a system biology of the brain to better understand the complex neurobiological mechanism of conversion of MCI to AD. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these neuroimaging genomic data sets have presented critical computational challenges for achieving the full transformative potential from comprehensive joint analysis of these heterogeneous and longitudinal data sets. This project aims to address these emerging challenges for early prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion with four aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel sparse bi-multivariate learning model based system biology framework for analysis of genome-wide association results across a large number of the structural and functional phenotypes derived from neuroimaging scans of the whole brain. Our new methods are designed for bi-multivariate analysis of high-throughput genomic data and complex Quantitative Traits (QTs) related to MCI-to-AD conversion by utilizing the system biology knowledge. Aim 2 is to further extend the learning approaches in Aim 1 with the new structured sparse models to the multi-dimensional data integration methods to identify the heterogeneous biomarkers from multiscale interrelated imaging genomic data for outcome prediction. Meanwhile, we will utilize the joint multi-task learning scheme to identify the stable genetic and phenotypic biomarkers that are associated with cognitive functions decline and MCI-to-AD conversion simultaneously. Based on the studies in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 is focused on revealing the longitudinal biomarkers of the changes of MCI progression or cognitive impairment by a new structured low-rank multi-task regression model. These biomarkers can fully differentiate longitudinal profiles of relevant QTs and better capture genetic associations with QT changes over time. Aim 4 is to evaluate and validate our proposed machine learning and bioinformatics algorithms on both synthetic data and real imaging genomic data. The results of this project will be able to efficiently improve our understanding of the complex neurobiological mechanism underlying the MCI-to-AD conversion. The identified biomarkers will finally enhance the early and accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion such that the clinical treatment can be provided in time.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Existing research works mainly focus on the studies using single genetic or neuroimaging data source and seldom consider the longitudinal data profiles. To address these limitations, this project focuses on 1) the development of novel bioinformatics and machine learning models for solving the computational challenges of analyzing the emerging multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data, and 2) identification of biomarkers with prediction power on MCI-to-AD conversion from the large and complex heterogeneous imaging genomic data with the comprehensive system biology knowledge guidance.            ",Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction,8964932,R01AG049371,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'case control', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ARLINGTON,R01,2015,416566,0.1891014609949589
"Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in  Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline. These objectives are directly relevant to the global effort to halt AD via early detection of cognitively-healthy persons at high  risk for progressing to AD. This is because current national guidelines for detecting risk for AD i asymptomatic persons call for extensive evaluations (e.g., nuclear imaging and lumbar puncture) that are expensive, not always well-tolerated by research volunteers and, more importantly, not widely available. In contrast, this project will rigorously assess brain changes i Stage 3 preclinical AD using routine, non-invasive, and broadly-deployable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain structure and blood flow. A specific deliverable of this project is the derivation of a single, quantitative, abnormality score that can be used-in combination with pertinent health information-for identifying, on an individual level, asymptomatic persons at heightened risk for AD. Such persons may then benefit from more extensive AD biomarker testing, closer monitoring, and treatment with disease-modifying drugs when such drugs become available. The project's success has material potential to significantly extend the public health reach of the proposed guidelines for defining preclinical AD. The three specific aims addressed in this project are: (1) specify the pattern of brain changes on MRI that is characteristic of Stage 3 preclinical AD, (2) prospectively assess the prognostic utility of an aggregate measure of midlife structural-functional MRI brain changes, and (3) preliminarily evaluate how individual differences related to cognitive reserve and genetic risk modify the association between early brain changes and future decline. Completion of the interrelated set of research and training activities proposed in this K23 will greatly foster the candidate's development into an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in conducting translational and multidisciplinary neuroimaging studies of preclinical AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To forestall the looming AD epidemic, there is need for highly sensitive yet easily deployable methods for identifying cognitively-healthy persons at high risk for AD. This project responds to this public health imperative by pursuing the development of an MRI aggregate measure that is grounded by established AD biomarkers, and is predictive of future cognitive decline in asymptomatic middle-aged adults.",Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD,8867116,K23AG045957,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloidosis', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Nuclear', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spin Labels', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Weight', 'Wisconsin', 'base', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'peer', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'responsible research conduct', 'success', 'volunteer']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K23,2015,162800,0.2455910298270455
"MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application of the MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia compares which of 3 approaches for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is best at accurately predicting incident clinical dementia. Of the two primary diagnostic methods currently used, psychometrically defined and clinical determined, application of criteria for psychometrically defined has been most variable. Further, a novel algorithmic method is emerging as an alternative unbiased approach. Using commonly applied clinical tools of cognitive performance and brain structure obtained from baseline and repeat administration of neuropsychological (NP) tests and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans, this proposed project will first determine what profile of cross-sectional or longitudinal neuropsychological tests and threshold performance levels, combined with imaging markers is the most efficacious in predicting progression to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Another set of analyses will test the algorithmic method. The diagnostic models that emerge from these two sets of analyses will then be compared to diagnoses of MCI using standard clinical criteria to determine which of the three methods best predicts incident dementia. The clinical diagnoses of MCI and dementia are available through a separately funded initiative. Also central to this grant proposal is the inclusion of external seasoned investigators, who will provid their expertise in definition and study of MCI and the factors influencing progression to disease. This effort aims to provide enhanced sensitivity in application of NP and MRI tools to detect subtle impairment at an earlier stage on the preclinical continuum and improved specificity in determining the MCI subtypes most highly associated with AD versus other types of dementia. Increased MCI diagnostic accuracy will enhance opportunity for more effective interventions, which have been largely disappointing to date, and could eventually leading to a delay in the onset or prevention of the clinical expression of AD. The MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia seeks to identify the most effective method and criteria for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is best predictive of incident Alzheimer's disease. Current efforts to treat AD have been ineffective because intervention occurs too late in the insidious process. The potential public health relevance of this proposed project is increased accuracy of diagnosis at the preclinical stage, where treatment opportunities may prove to be more successful and prevention is most feasible.","MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia",8894346,R01AG016495,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Etiology', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seasons', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Vascular Dementia', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective intervention', 'entorhinal cortex', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2015,620330,0.1292964472809365
"Regional Neurotoxicity & Early Biomarkers of Air Pollution Effects on Brain Aging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more women than men and burdens millions of aging Americans and their families. While our knowledge of modifiable risk factors for AD remains limited, there is growing evidence that exposure to ambient air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) and ozone, accelerates brain aging. Built on our collaborative work on neurotoxic effects of ambient air pollution and cognitive aging in Women's Health Initiative Study (WHIMS), this application will address two critical knowledge gaps in this promising area of air pollution-neuroepidemiology: (1) It is unclear whether brain region- and/or site-specific neurotoxicity occurs from ambient air pollution exposure; and (2) Strong epidemiologic evidence linking ambient air pollution to increased AD risk are still lacking. These knowledge gaps reflect limitations of previous research with conventional analyses of neuroimaging data and insufficient power in linking AD risk with exposures. This application will overcome these challenges by combing three unique data sources (WHIMS air pollution exposure; WHIMS MRI; and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI]). Leveraging the longitudinal brain structure data from WHIMS MRI (gathered in 2005-6; 2010-2011) plus air pollution exposure estimates generated for WHIMS (gathered in 1993-2010), we will apply high-dimensional computational methods to conduct voxel-based analyses with a systematic and agnostic approach to examining the brain region-specific neurotoxicity of air pollution. This exploratory R21 application will also test the hypothesized adverse effect of ambient air pollution on the pattern of brain structure predictive of increased AD risk in an optimal population context, where ambient air pollutants affected the cognitive aging in older women. ADNI provides a well-characterized clinical database of cognitive normal and AD phenotypes, enabling our development/validation of novel AD risk metrics based on neuroimaging data applicable to WHIMS MRI. Thus, our Specific Aims are: Aim 1) Using structural brain MRI and air pollution data from the WHIMS-MRI cohort, to examine whether spatial patterns of grey matter/white matter atrophy at baseline and their changes over time are associated with air pollutant exposures; and Aim 2) Using novel metrics of AD risk to conduct a quantitative assessment linking AD risk with ambient air pollution. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with complementary expertise in high-dimensional machining learning for neuroimaging data analyses, cognitive aging, and air pollution neurotoxicology/epidemiology. Our study will advance the field of environmental epidemiology of aging by using advanced analytical tools to link air pollution exposures to spatial patterns of brain structure and the predicted risk of AD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Long-term exposure to air pollutants may adversely impact the cognitive health of older individuals, however this link is not well-established and whether this conveys an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease is unknown. Leveraging brain magnetic resonance imaging data collected at geographically dispersed US sites and geocoded estimates of person-specific long-term environmental exposures, we will use sophisticated machine learning methods to characterize associations that exposure to air pollution has with brain structure and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determining the nature and extent of these relationships, and their consistency across subgroups of older women, we will identify targets towards improving the health of seniors.                ",Regional Neurotoxicity & Early Biomarkers of Air Pollution Effects on Brain Aging,8960162,R21AG051113,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurotoxins', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Ozone', 'Particulate Matter', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aging brain', 'ambient air pollution', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'interest', 'men', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'older women', 'particle', 'public health relevance', 'white matter']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2015,249785,0.15381096729646013
"Novel Strategies for Blood-based Biomarkers for AD: Role of Genetic Variation in a Multivariate Framework ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Without any successful drug trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment and proven efficient therapies for AD, early detection of AD in asymptomatic or prodromal stages is critically important in order to increase chances of reducing irreversible brain damages, slowing down disease progression, and producing better results in any intervention trials. Several biomarkers from MRI, PET, CSF, and peripheral blood show their potential as diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic response biomarkers. Among them, blood-based biomarkers, especially proteomic analytes from peripheral blood have great potential as AD screening tools due to its minimal invasiveness and easy access of collection method and would have an extraordinary impact on research and eventually clinical care to facilitate the investigation of early intervention. During the last couple of years, many studies have been performed to investigate the direct relationship between a set of measured plasma (serum) proteomics analyte levels and a set of AD relevant phenotypes using various assay technologies. Due to several technical challenges related to sample collection, storage and assay, previous studies couldn't fully investigate the potential of plasma proteomics data, resulting in relatively weak replications. Beyond these technical issues, previous studies to date overlooked two very important factors: influence of genetic variations associated with each protein analyte and correlational structure of multi-analyte proteomic data. Recently we have shown that genetic variation substantially influences plasma proteomic analyte levels independent of disease status. Therefore, in assessing the diagnostic and prognostic significance of proteomic data, gene variants should be taken into account. Another potential reason of weak replication could be relative weak diagnostic power of individual analytes because the majority of investigation focused on the effect of each measured protein analyte level on a set of given phenotype. In many cases, multianalyte molecular biomarkers are correlated with one another and most of studies using plasma proteomics analytes did not consider correlational structure among analytes when assessing their diagnostic potential. Although the diagnostic power of individual analyte can be weak, multivariate approaches to identify a set of biologically meaningful ensembles of analytes may better elucidate diagnostic and prognostic power of plasma proteomic signature. In this proposed study, we will address these two knowledge gaps in assessing potential of plasma proteomic analytes through a multivariate approach by applying advanced analytic methods including multi-dimensional data reduction, gene pathway-enrichment analysis, imaging genetics, and supervised and unsupervised learning. Results of this project could have a transformative impact on identification and evaluation strategies of proteomic analytes as diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic response biomarkers and proposed advanced analytical strategies can be applied to fluid-based multi-analyte data for various neurodegenerative disorders in addition to AD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diagnostic and prognostic potential of plasma protein analytes for early detection of AD has not been fully investigated due to various factors including two very important, but overlooked factors: influence of genetic variations associated with protein analytes and correlational structure of multi-analyte proteomic data. The proposed study will investigate influence of genetic variations on the evaluation of the diagnostic and prognostic potential of plasma proteins while addressing the two important factors through a multivariate approach. This study will have a very high impact on development and evaluation strategies of molecular biomarkers for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.            ",Novel Strategies for Blood-based Biomarkers for AD: Role of Genetic Variation in a Multivariate Framework,8951774,R03AG050856,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'minimally invasive', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel strategies', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R03,2015,78000,0.14050509074699513
"A Structural Brain MRI Dementia Forecast Tool ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a devastating disease with no available treatment or prevention. The current lifetime risk for a 65-year-old individual is estimated to be around 10%. Given current projections, over 13.5 million individuals will be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by 2050.  As the development of therapeutic strategies progresses through drug trials, the current view is that the optimal window of opportunity to benefit an individual is years before symptoms appear, in what is called the preclinical phase. Preclinical AD is thought to begin with the abnormal accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. In research and clinical trials, identifying individuals with these plaques is possible with PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures. Yet, with a cost of more than $5000 per scan, PiB-PET is an expensive means of screening, and involves exposure to ionizing radiation, a considerable health risk. A CSF test necessitates an invasive lumbar puncture with the accompanying risks of headaches, back pain, bleeding, infection and even potential brainstem herniation.  We propose to develop software tools that make use of structural MRI scan data to predict the amyloid status of cognitively normal individuals undergoing a screening process, and, for a set of individuals, identify those most at risk of progressing to AD. We believe a two-step MRI + PiB-PET screening procedure will yield significant cost savings by reducing the number of expensive PET scans, and might further help limit redundant radiation exposure due to unnecessary PET imaging in low-risk individuals. Lastly, the identification of individuals with amyloid accumulation who are at risk of imminent clinical decline will be invaluable for drug trial recruitment and future clinical management.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal is to build software tools that will predict amyloid status and forecast future clinical progression toward AD dementia. The tools, which examine measures derived from an MRI scan, will be invaluable for pre-screening, stratifying, and tracking individuals recruited for preclinical AD trials, and will offer substantial cost savings b reducing the number of PET scans necessary to identify amyloid-positive cognitively normal individuals.            ",A Structural Brain MRI Dementia Forecast Tool,9046797,R41AG052246,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Back Pain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Death', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Headache', 'Health', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Ionizing radiation', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Radiation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'amyloid pathology', 'base', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'human old age (65+)', 'interest', 'lifetime risk', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'software development', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'verification and validation']",NIA,"CORTICOMETRICS, LLC",R41,2015,225000,-0.008386469974312907
"Maximizing Power in AD Clinical Trials via Multimodal Machine Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An emphasis in ongoing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is identifying those biomarkers which best predict future cognitive decline at the various stages of disease progression. These biomarkers can then serve as early markers for diagnosis, and for selection of subjects into clinical trials. Recent results suggest that the identification of such discriminative biomarkers is possible by adapting machine learning methods for this problem: but studies have primarily used modalities in isolation so far. The sensitivity/specificity offered by these methods is unsatisfactory for more clinically relevant questions: which MCI patients will convert to AD? Answering such questions requires new methods that leverage all data sources (e.g., imaging modalities, CSF measures) in conjunction. This project focuses on how data from multiple biomarkers should be optimally aggregated to best predict future cognitive decline, and how these models can improve clinical trials for AD. Hypothesis: Significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity for discriminating AD, MCI, and healthy controls at the level of individual subjects are possible by making use of multiple modalities (together with longitudinal data) simultaneously. Further, these methods will significantly improve sample size estimates in clinical trials, and help derive customized outcomes for evaluating new treatment procedures. Specific Aims: (1) To develop new image-based machine learning algorithms that can take advantage of multiple modalities simultaneously within a unified framework. (2) To provide a software and extensively evaluate these methods on the ADNI and BLSA datasets, to assess the sensitivity/specificity attainable by truly multi-modal analysis methods. (3) To interface multi-modal classification methods with AD clinical trials: (a) by developing comprehensive sample size estimates needed to observe specific outcomes, and using these methods to derive customized outcomes for an ongoing R01-funded observational/prospective study here at the Wisconsin ADRC. Methods: We will develop new multi-modal machine learning methods that will optimally exploit all data sources simultaneously. Our models will also incorporate longitudinal data, and exploit interaction between modalities at different stages of the disease. This will be used to derive a Multi-Modal Disease Marker (MMDM) (Aim 1). The algorithms will be evaluated on large-scale well-characterized datasets and provided as software tools (Aim 2). We will use these models to improve AD clinical trials in two ways: by sample enrichment and customized outcomes that provide maximum statistical power to detect treatment effects (Aim 3). Significance: This project capitalizes on the Wisconsin ADRC's expertise in machine learning, statistical clinical trial design, imaging, and clinical diagnosis of AD and pre-AD conditions. This project will be the first to implement a multi-modal machine learning metric specifically designed to speed up clinical trials so that potential therapies can be evaluated and an effective treatment arrived at as quickly as possible.          This project will develop novel methods and software systems for highly accurate and automated identification of patterns related to Alzheimer's disease. The techniques will take advantage of the aggregate information from an individual's brain images from multiple imaging modalities such as structural images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance) and functional images (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography), as well as cognitive and demographic information. The software, as a result of successful completion of this project, will provide invaluable assistance in AD diagnosis (and predicting cognitive decline) at the level of individual subjects, as well as allow clinical experiments to be more effective in evaluating which drugs and treatments are effective for such neurological disorders.

"Computational neuroanatomy of aging and AD via pattern analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our previous work on computational neuroanatomy of aging, and investigates the use of advanced pattern analysis methods in early detection of imaging phenotypes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD is a disease of rapidly increasing prevalence and clinical significance, in an aging population. Currently available diagnostic tests detect the disease at extremely late stages, perhaps more than a decade after it first begins to develop. A variety of imaging methods offers great promise for the detection of early signs of brain change, which can be indicative of future clinical progression to AD. However structural and functional imaging patterns characteristic of AD are subtle, spatially complex, evolving dynamically with age/time, and are overlaid on changes induced by normal aging. This raises the need for sophisticated methods for image analysis and pattern recognition. Towards this goal, Aim 3 integrates high-dimensional pattern analysis and recognition methods aiming to quantitatively describe imaging patterns that have diagnostic and predictive value. Since these patterns can be spatially complex and subtle, conventional image analysis methods can be challenged. We therefore build on the state of the art of machine learning and pattern recognition, focusing on the major challenge encountered in medical imaging: high dimensionality of imaging data relative to the available sample sizes. Optimal multi-parametric feature construction and dimensionality reduction methods are necessary to meet this challenge and are considered in Aim 2 along with multi-parametric classification and clustering methods. The foundation of the pattern analysis of the work in Aim 3 is also set in Aim 1, which deals with more ""low-level"" fundamental image analysis problem: registration, which is a process that places image data to a standardized coordinate system, thereby enabling statistical analysis of spatio-temporal imaging patterns across healthy and patient populations: an optimal mathematical representation of morphological data is developed via a group-wise registration process. We apply this method to structural, functional and amyloid deposition image data from two of the largest studies of normal aging (BLSA) and AD (ADNI).        Alzheimer's Disease poses a major medical and socioeconomic problem, which becomes increasingly prevalent as the population lives longer. This project develops and applies computer methods for multi-parametric analysis of MRI and PET scans, aiming to detect very early markers of the disease. As patterns of brain change are complex, subtle, and occur in tandem with normal changes brought by healthy aging, they are extremely difficult to detect at early stages, during which effective treatments are likely to exist in the near future. Advanced methods for pattern analysis and recognition have shown high promise in terms of measuring and detecting such early changes. This project will contribute such methods to the field. It will also apply them to two of the largest studies of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease: BLSA and ADNI.

"Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in  Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline. These objectives are directly relevant to the global effort to halt AD via early detection of cognitively-healthy persons at high  risk for progressing to AD. This is because current national guidelines for detecting risk for AD i asymptomatic persons call for extensive evaluations (e.g., nuclear imaging and lumbar puncture) that are expensive, not always well-tolerated by research volunteers and, more importantly, not widely available. In contrast, this project will rigorously assess brain changes i Stage 3 preclinical AD using routine, non-invasive, and broadly-deployable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain structure and blood flow. A specific deliverable of this project is the derivation of a single, quantitative, abnormality score that can be used-in combination with pertinent health information-for identifying, on an individual level, asymptomatic persons at heightened risk for AD. Such persons may then benefit from more extensive AD biomarker testing, closer monitoring, and treatment with disease-modifying drugs when such drugs become available. The project's success has material potential to significantly extend the public health reach of the proposed guidelines for defining preclinical AD. The three specific aims addressed in this project are: (1) specify the pattern of brain changes on MRI that is characteristic of Stage 3 preclinical AD, (2) prospectively assess the prognostic utility of an aggregate measure of midlife structural-functional MRI brain changes, and (3) preliminarily evaluate how individual differences related to cognitive reserve and genetic risk modify the association between early brain changes and future decline. Completion of the interrelated set of research and training activities proposed in this K23 will greatly foster the candidate's development into an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in conducting translational and multidisciplinary neuroimaging studies of preclinical AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To forestall the looming AD epidemic, there is need for highly sensitive yet easily deployable methods for identifying cognitively-healthy persons at high risk for AD. This project responds to this public health imperative by pursuing the development of an MRI aggregate measure that is grounded by established AD biomarkers, and is predictive of future cognitive decline in asymptomatic middle-aged adults.",Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD,8723051,K23AG045957,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloidosis', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Nuclear', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spin Labels', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Weight', 'Wisconsin', 'base', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'peer', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'responsible research conduct', 'success', 'volunteer']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K23,2014,162800,0.2455910298270455
"MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application of the MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia compares which of 3 approaches for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is best at accurately predicting incident clinical dementia. Of the two primary diagnostic methods currently used, psychometrically defined and clinical determined, application of criteria for psychometrically defined has been most variable. Further, a novel algorithmic method is emerging as an alternative unbiased approach. Using commonly applied clinical tools of cognitive performance and brain structure obtained from baseline and repeat administration of neuropsychological (NP) tests and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans, this proposed project will first determine what profile of cross-sectional or longitudinal neuropsychological tests and threshold performance levels, combined with imaging markers is the most efficacious in predicting progression to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Another set of analyses will test the algorithmic method. The diagnostic models that emerge from these two sets of analyses will then be compared to diagnoses of MCI using standard clinical criteria to determine which of the three methods best predicts incident dementia. The clinical diagnoses of MCI and dementia are available through a separately funded initiative. Also central to this grant proposal is the inclusion of external seasoned investigators, who will provid their expertise in definition and study of MCI and the factors influencing progression to disease. This effort aims to provide enhanced sensitivity in application of NP and MRI tools to detect subtle impairment at an earlier stage on the preclinical continuum and improved specificity in determining the MCI subtypes most highly associated with AD versus other types of dementia. Increased MCI diagnostic accuracy will enhance opportunity for more effective interventions, which have been largely disappointing to date, and could eventually leading to a delay in the onset or prevention of the clinical expression of AD.          The MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia seeks to identify the most effective method and criteria for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is best predictive of incident Alzheimer's disease.

"Maximizing Power in AD Clinical Trials via Multimodal Machine Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An emphasis in ongoing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is identifying those biomarkers which best predict future cognitive decline at the various stages of disease progression. These biomarkers can then serve as early markers for diagnosis, and for selection of subjects into clinical trials. Recent results suggest that the identification of such discriminative biomarkers is possible by adapting machine learning methods for this problem: but studies have primarily used modalities in isolation so far. The sensitivity/specificity offered by these methods is unsatisfactory for more clinically relevant questions: which MCI patients will convert to AD? Answering such questions requires new methods that leverage all data sources (e.g., imaging modalities, CSF measures) in conjunction. This project focuses on how data from multiple biomarkers should be optimally aggregated to best predict future cognitive decline, and how these models can improve clinical trials for AD. Hypothesis: Significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity for discriminating AD, MCI, and healthy controls at the level of individual subjects are possible by making use of multiple modalities (together with longitudinal data) simultaneously. Further, these methods will significantly improve sample size estimates in clinical trials, and help derive customized outcomes for evaluating new treatment procedures. Specific Aims: (1) To develop new image-based machine learning algorithms that can take advantage of multiple modalities simultaneously within a unified framework. (2) To provide a software and extensively evaluate these methods on the ADNI and BLSA datasets, to assess the sensitivity/specificity attainable by truly multi-modal analysis methods. (3) To interface multi-modal classification methods with AD clinical trials: (a) by developing comprehensive sample size estimates needed to observe specific outcomes, and using these methods to derive customized outcomes for an ongoing R01-funded observational/prospective study here at the Wisconsin ADRC. Methods: We will develop new multi-modal machine learning methods that will optimally exploit all data sources simultaneously. Our models will also incorporate longitudinal data, and exploit interaction between modalities at different stages of the disease. This will be used to derive a Multi-Modal Disease Marker (MMDM) (Aim 1). The algorithms will be evaluated on large-scale well-characterized datasets and provided as software tools (Aim 2). We will use these models to improve AD clinical trials in two ways: by sample enrichment and customized outcomes that provide maximum statistical power to detect treatment effects (Aim 3). Significance: This project capitalizes on the Wisconsin ADRC's expertise in machine learning, statistical clinical trial design, imaging, and clinical diagnosis of AD and pre-AD conditions. This project will be the first to implement a multi-modal machine learning metric specifically designed to speed up clinical trials so that potential therapies can be evaluated and an effective treatment arrived at as quickly as possible.          This project will develop novel methods and software systems for highly accurate and automated identification of patterns related to Alzheimer's disease. The techniques will take advantage of the aggregate information from an individual's brain images from multiple imaging modalities such as structural images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance) and functional images (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography), as well as cognitive and demographic information. The software, as a result of successful completion of this project, will provide invaluable assistance in AD diagnosis (and predicting cognitive decline) at the level of individual subjects, as well as allow clinical experiments to be more effective in evaluating which drugs and treatments are effective for such neurological disorders.

"Computational neuroanatomy of aging and AD via pattern analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our previous work on computational neuroanatomy of aging, and investigates the use of advanced pattern analysis methods in early detection of imaging phenotypes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD is a disease of rapidly increasing prevalence and clinical significance, in an aging population. Currently available diagnostic tests detect the disease at extremely late stages, perhaps more than a decade after it first begins to develop. A variety of imaging methods offers great promise for the detection of early signs of brain change, which can be indicative of future clinical progression to AD. However structural and functional imaging patterns characteristic of AD are subtle, spatially complex, evolving dynamically with age/time, and are overlaid on changes induced by normal aging. This raises the need for sophisticated methods for image analysis and pattern recognition. Towards this goal, Aim 3 integrates high-dimensional pattern analysis and recognition methods aiming to quantitatively describe imaging patterns that have diagnostic and predictive value. Since these patterns can be spatially complex and subtle, conventional image analysis methods can be challenged. We therefore build on the state of the art of machine learning and pattern recognition, focusing on the major challenge encountered in medical imaging: high dimensionality of imaging data relative to the available sample sizes. Optimal multi-parametric feature construction and dimensionality reduction methods are necessary to meet this challenge and are considered in Aim 2 along with multi-parametric classification and clustering methods. The foundation of the pattern analysis of the work in Aim 3 is also set in Aim 1, which deals with more ""low-level"" fundamental image analysis problem: registration, which is a process that places image data to a standardized coordinate system, thereby enabling statistical analysis of spatio-temporal imaging patterns across healthy and patient populations: an optimal mathematical representation of morphological data is developed via a group-wise registration process. We apply this method to structural, functional and amyloid deposition image data from two of the largest studies of normal aging (BLSA) and AD (ADNI).        Alzheimer's Disease poses a major medical and socioeconomic problem, which becomes increasingly prevalent as the population lives longer. This project develops and applies computer methods for multi-parametric analysis of MRI and PET scans, aiming to detect very early markers of the disease. As patterns of brain change are complex, subtle, and occur in tandem with normal changes brought by healthy aging, they are extremely difficult to detect at early stages, during which effective treatments are likely to exist in the near future. Advanced methods for pattern analysis and recognition have shown high promise in terms of measuring and detecting such early changes. This project will contribute such methods to the field. It will also apply them to two of the largest studies of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease: BLSA and ADNI.

"Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in  Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline. These objectives are directly relevant to the global effort to halt AD via early detection of cognitively-healthy persons at high  risk for progressing to AD. This is because current national guidelines for detecting risk for AD i asymptomatic persons call for extensive evaluations (e.g., nuclear imaging and lumbar puncture) that are expensive, not always well-tolerated by research volunteers and, more importantly, not widely available. In contrast, this project will rigorously assess brain changes i Stage 3 preclinical AD using routine, non-invasive, and broadly-deployable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain structure and blood flow. A specific deliverable of this project is the derivation of a single, quantitative, abnormality score that can be used-in combination with pertinent health information-for identifying, on an individual level, asymptomatic persons at heightened risk for AD. Such persons may then benefit from more extensive AD biomarker testing, closer monitoring, and treatment with disease-modifying drugs when such drugs become available. The project's success has material potential to significantly extend the public health reach of the proposed guidelines for defining preclinical AD. The three specific aims addressed in this project are: (1) specify the pattern of brain changes on MRI that is characteristic of Stage 3 preclinical AD, (2) prospectively assess the prognostic utility of an aggregate measure of midlife structural-functional MRI brain changes, and (3) preliminarily evaluate how individual differences related to cognitive reserve and genetic risk modify the association between early brain changes and future decline. Completion of the interrelated set of research and training activities proposed in this K23 will greatly foster the candidate's development into an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in conducting translational and multidisciplinary neuroimaging studies of preclinical AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To forestall the looming AD epidemic, there is need for highly sensitive yet easily deployable methods for identifying cognitively-healthy persons at high risk for AD. This project responds to this public health imperative by pursuing the development of an MRI aggregate measure that is grounded by established AD biomarkers, and is predictive of future cognitive decline in asymptomatic middle-aged adults.",Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD,8593003,K23AG045957,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloidosis', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Nuclear', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spin Labels', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Weight', 'Wisconsin', 'base', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'improved', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'peer', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'responsible research conduct', 'success', 'volunteer']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K23,2013,162800,0.2455910298270455
"MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application of the MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia compares which of 3 approaches for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is best at accurately predicting incident clinical dementia. Of the two primary diagnostic methods currently used, psychometrically defined and clinical determined, application of criteria for psychometrically defined has been most variable. Further, a novel algorithmic method is emerging as an alternative unbiased approach. Using commonly applied clinical tools of cognitive performance and brain structure obtained from baseline and repeat administration of neuropsychological (NP) tests and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans, this proposed project will first determine what profile of cross-sectional or longitudinal neuropsychological tests and threshold performance levels, combined with imaging markers is the most efficacious in predicting progression to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Another set of analyses will test the algorithmic method. The diagnostic models that emerge from these two sets of analyses will then be compared to diagnoses of MCI using standard clinical criteria to determine which of the three methods best predicts incident dementia. The clinical diagnoses of MCI and dementia are available through a separately funded initiative. Also central to this grant proposal is the inclusion of external seasoned investigators, who will provid their expertise in definition and study of MCI and the factors influencing progression to disease. This effort aims to provide enhanced sensitivity in application of NP and MRI tools to detect subtle impairment at an earlier stage on the preclinical continuum and improved specificity in determining the MCI subtypes most highly associated with AD versus other types of dementia. Increased MCI diagnostic accuracy will enhance opportunity for more effective interventions, which have been largely disappointing to date, and could eventually leading to a delay in the onset or prevention of the clinical expression of AD.

"Computational neuroanatomy of aging and AD via pattern analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our previous work on computational neuroanatomy of aging, and investigates the use of advanced pattern analysis methods in early detection of imaging phenotypes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD is a disease of rapidly increasing prevalence and clinical significance, in an aging population. Currently available diagnostic tests detect the disease at extremely late stages, perhaps more than a decade after it first begins to develop. A variety of imaging methods offers great promise for the detection of early signs of brain change, which can be indicative of future clinical progression to AD. However structural and functional imaging patterns characteristic of AD are subtle, spatially complex, evolving dynamically with age/time, and are overlaid on changes induced by normal aging. This raises the need for sophisticated methods for image analysis and pattern recognition. Towards this goal, Aim 3 integrates high-dimensional pattern analysis and recognition methods aiming to quantitatively describe imaging patterns that have diagnostic and predictive value. Since these patterns can be spatially complex and subtle, conventional image analysis methods can be challenged. We therefore build on the state of the art of machine learning and pattern recognition, focusing on the major challenge encountered in medical imaging: high dimensionality of imaging data relative to the available sample sizes. Optimal multi-parametric feature construction and dimensionality reduction methods are necessary to meet this challenge and are considered in Aim 2 along with multi-parametric classification and clustering methods. The foundation of the pattern analysis of the work in Aim 3 is also set in Aim 1, which deals with more ""low-level"" fundamental image analysis problem: registration, which is a process that places image data to a standardized coordinate system, thereby enabling statistical analysis of spatio-temporal imaging patterns across healthy and patient populations: an optimal mathematical representation of morphological data is developed via a group-wise registration process. We apply this method to structural, functional and amyloid deposition image data from two of the largest studies of normal aging (BLSA) and AD (ADNI).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's Disease poses a major medical and socioeconomic problem, which becomes increasingly prevalent as the population lives longer. This project develops and applies computer methods for multi-parametric analysis of MRI and PET scans, aiming to detect very early markers of the disease. As patterns of brain change are complex, subtle, and occur in tandem with normal changes brought by healthy aging, they are extremely difficult to detect at early stages, during which effective treatments are likely to exist in the near future. Advanced methods for pattern analysis and recognition have shown high promise in terms of measuring and detecting such early changes. This project will contribute such methods to the field. It will also apply them to two of the largest studies of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease: BLSA and ADNI.           Alzheimer's Disease poses a major medical and socioeconomic problem, which becomes increasingly prevalent as the population lives longer.

"AD classification algorithms using ADNI multi-modal image data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A major emphasis in recent Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is identifying features and avenues for early intervention in the preclinical state of AD.  This is essential because by the time a patient exhibits symptomatic dementia, millions of neurons in the brain have already been lost.  Advanced imaging methods that enable visualization of AD associated brain changes at an early stage are likely to play an important role in detecting the onset of neurodegeneration early, prior to extensive neural loss.  In parallel, automated image analysis algorithms must be developed to enable not only accurate localization and characterization of changes but also identify patterns from the data to enable individual subject diagnosis.  Recent results suggest that this may indeed be possible using machine learning techniques:  sensitivity and specificity of around 85% have been obtained by several groups using either T1-weighted MR (Magnetic Resonance), FDG PET (18fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography), or other modalities.  The availability of multiple imaging modalities for longitudinally followed subjects within the ADNI data now offers the opportunity of significant improvements in sensitivity/specificity of diagnostic tools for AD.  This can be achieved by developing new mathematical models to leverage multiple imaging modalities and longitudinal data in conjunction-for accurate diagnosis as well as to aid in analyzing the effect of new treatments, as they become available.  Hypothesis:  Significant improvements in accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) for discriminating AD, MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), and healthy controls (at the level of individual subjects) are possible by making use of multiple imaging modalities and longitudinal data.  Specific Aims:  (1) To develop new image-based classification algorithms that can take advantage of multiple imaging modalities simultaneously within a unified framework; and to extensively evaluate these methods on the entire ADNI image dataset.  (2) To extend our algorithms to incorporate longitudinal image data for further improvements and perform evaluation on ADNI image data.  (3) To design and disseminate an open source software system to assist in AD diagnosis.  Methods:  We have recently developed a new machine learning based algorithm for AD classification that gives 85% sensitivity/specificity in correctly identifying AD patients from healthy controls using T1-weighted MR images from ADNI, and over 80% classification sensitivity/specificity using FDG PET images.  Building on these efforts, we will extend and improve our models to utilize multi-modal image data (Specific Aim 1).  The algorithms will be further augmented with longitudinal data to enable more accurate prediction for difficult to diagnose cases (Specific Aim 2).  We will extensively evaluate the stepwise improvements of our method on the ADNI dataset and perform statistical evaluations of the relationship of measures such as the classification confidence with various cognitive/laboratory biomarkers available within ADNI.  These algorithms will be implemented and disseminated via an easy to use software system to facilitate AD diagnosis (Specific Aim 3).  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will develop novel algorithms and software systems for highly accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.  The techniques will take advantage of the individual's brain images from two or more imaging modalities-such as structural images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance) and functional images (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography).  The algorithms and software as a result of successful completion of this project will combine the multi-modal image information with the longitudinal data of the patient (if available) to provide invaluable assistance in AD diagnosis at the level of individual subjects.        The proposed research will develop novel algorithms and software systems for highly accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

"GENOMEWIDE ANALYSIS OF INTERACTIONS IN ALZHEIMER DISEASE USING NEURAL NETWORKS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Much evidence suggests that AD clearly has a measurable genetic component. Many gene-mapping studies have found genes associated with AD but most of them have failed to replicate in follow-up studies. Even the confirmed genetic factors only explain a small amount of AD heritability, leaving most of the AD due to genetic factors unexplained. One reason for this Is that most studies on AD (and other complex diseases) only examine a single genetic variant at a time for association to AD. It Is l^nown, however, that gene-gene and gene-environment Interactions are ubiquitous, and likely play a role in human disease. This has been documented in model organisms, and when investigated properly, has been found to influence disease In humans. Yet most studies do not investigate Interactions among genetic and environmental factors that Influence AD risl< because few computational methods exist that can fully tal^e advantage of the wealth of data generated In contemporary genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we propose developing two major Improvements to an existing machine learning method (Grammatical Evolution Neural Networl<s; GENN) that already has the ability to detect interactions that Influence disease risk In genome-wide scale data. One extension will improve the model fitting capabilities of GENN while reducing computation time required by the algorithm. The second extension will allow researchers to incorporate Into the analysis existing biological knowledge from publicly accessible databases. This will guide the search for Important disease-Influencing interactions to biologically plausible solutions. We will confirm that these extensions work properly and measure the power and efficiency gains with realistic simulation studies. These extensions will be implemented in a freely available software package that will be accessible to investigators researching genetics of other complex diseases. We will apply the GENN method to a GWAS dataset with approximately 500 AD cases and 500 healthy age-matched unaffected Individuals to discover gene-gene and gene-environment Interactions that Influence AD risk. Finally, we will access publicly available GWAS data from other published studies to validate our findings. In this study we propose developing two novel major extensions to an existing statistical method that is capable discovering genetic factors that cause human disease. We will use the improved version of this methodology to discover genetic and environmental causes of Alzheimer Disease. We will confirm our findings using independent data.           n/a",GENOMEWIDE ANALYSIS OF INTERACTIONS IN ALZHEIMER DISEASE USING NEURAL NETWORKS,7933843,F31NS066638,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Other Genetics', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'disorder risk', 'gene discovery', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2010,21180,0.13556723943895052

"AD classification algorithms using ADNI multi-modal image data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A major emphasis in recent Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is identifying features and avenues for early intervention in the preclinical state of AD.  This is essential because by the time a patient exhibits symptomatic dementia, millions of neurons in the brain have already been lost.  Advanced imaging methods that enable visualization of AD associated brain changes at an early stage are likely to play an important role in detecting the onset of neurodegeneration early, prior to extensive neural loss.  In parallel, automated image analysis algorithms must be developed to enable not only accurate localization and characterization of changes but also identify patterns from the data to enable individual subject diagnosis.  Recent results suggest that this may indeed be possible using machine learning techniques:  sensitivity and specificity of around 85% have been obtained by several groups using either T1-weighted MR (Magnetic Resonance), FDG PET (18fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography), or other modalities.  The availability of multiple imaging modalities for longitudinally followed subjects within the ADNI data now offers the opportunity of significant improvements in sensitivity/specificity of diagnostic tools for AD.  This can be achieved by developing new mathematical models to leverage multiple imaging modalities and longitudinal data in conjunction-for accurate diagnosis as well as to aid in analyzing the effect of new treatments, as they become available.  Hypothesis:  Significant improvements in accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) for discriminating AD, MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), and healthy controls (at the level of individual subjects) are possible by making use of multiple imaging modalities and longitudinal data.  Specific Aims:  (1) To develop new image-based classification algorithms that can take advantage of multiple imaging modalities simultaneously within a unified framework; and to extensively evaluate these methods on the entire ADNI image dataset.  (2) To extend our algorithms to incorporate longitudinal image data for further improvements and perform evaluation on ADNI image data.  (3) To design and disseminate an open source software system to assist in AD diagnosis.  Methods:  We have recently developed a new machine learning based algorithm for AD classification that gives 85% sensitivity/specificity in correctly identifying AD patients from healthy controls using T1-weighted MR images from ADNI, and over 80% classification sensitivity/specificity using FDG PET images.  Building on these efforts, we will extend and improve our models to utilize multi-modal image data (Specific Aim 1).  The algorithms will be further augmented with longitudinal data to enable more accurate prediction for difficult to diagnose cases (Specific Aim 2).  We will extensively evaluate the stepwise improvements of our method on the ADNI dataset and perform statistical evaluations of the relationship of measures such as the classification confidence with various cognitive/laboratory biomarkers available within ADNI.  These algorithms will be implemented and disseminated via an easy to use software system to facilitate AD diagnosis (Specific Aim 3).  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will develop novel algorithms and software systems for highly accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.  The techniques will take advantage of the individual's brain images from two or more imaging modalities-such as structural images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance) and functional images (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography).  The algorithms and software as a result of successful completion of this project will combine the multi-modal image information with the longitudinal data of the patient (if available) to provide invaluable assistance in AD diagnosis at the level of individual subjects.       The proposed research will develop novel algorithms and software systems for highly accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

"GENOMEWIDE ANALYSIS OF INTERACTIONS IN ALZHEIMER DISEASE USING NEURAL NETWORKS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Much evidence suggests that AD clearly has a measurable genetic component. Many gene-mapping studies have found genes associated with AD but most of them have failed to replicate in follow-up studies. Even the confirmed genetic factors only explain a small amount of AD heritability, leaving most of the AD due to genetic factors unexplained. One reason for this Is that most studies on AD (and other complex diseases) only examine a single genetic variant at a time for association to AD. It Is l^nown, however, that gene-gene and gene-environment Interactions are ubiquitous, and likely play a role in human disease. This has been documented in model organisms, and when investigated properly, has been found to influence disease In humans. Yet most studies do not investigate Interactions among genetic and environmental factors that Influence AD risl< because few computational methods exist that can fully tal^e advantage of the wealth of data generated In contemporary genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we propose developing two major Improvements to an existing machine learning method (Grammatical Evolution Neural Networl<s; GENN) that already has the ability to detect interactions that Influence disease risk In genome-wide scale data. One extension will improve the model fitting capabilities of GENN while reducing computation time required by the algorithm. The second extension will allow researchers to incorporate Into the analysis existing biological knowledge from publicly accessible databases. This will guide the search for Important disease-Influencing interactions to biologically plausible solutions. We will confirm that these extensions work properly and measure the power and efficiency gains with realistic simulation studies. These extensions will be implemented in a freely available software package that will be accessible to investigators researching genetics of other complex diseases. We will apply the GENN method to a GWAS dataset with approximately 500 AD cases and 500 healthy age-matched unaffected Individuals to discover gene-gene and gene-environment Interactions that Influence AD risk. Finally, we will access publicly available GWAS data from other published studies to validate our findings. In this study we propose developing two novel major extensions to an existing statistical method that is capable discovering genetic factors that cause human disease. We will use the improved version of this methodology to discover genetic and environmental causes of Alzheimer Disease. We will confirm our findings using independent data.           n/a",GENOMEWIDE ANALYSIS OF INTERACTIONS IN ALZHEIMER DISEASE USING NEURAL NETWORKS,7749639,F31NS066638,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Other Genetics', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'disorder risk', 'gene discovery', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,26019,0.13556723943895052
"Computational methods for regional hippocampal morphometry in AD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a quantitative researcher with a background in computer science and a record of publications in the areas of image analysis methodology, computer vision and machine learning.

"Visual Cognition and Daily Function in AD and PD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of factors that keep individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from functioning optimally in their daily lives is of singular importance. Many aspects of vision and visual cognition are impaired in AD, including the abilities to recognize and discriminate objects. These impairments arise from pathological changes in high-order association areas of the brain, but also from defective input from lower-level visual processing areas. Because many healthy elderly adults and people with AD take multiple pills on a daily basis, and occasionally drop pills onto a tabletop or floor surface, a real-world search task is proposed that investigates how perceptual factors such as contrast sensitivity and depth perception affect the ability to detect a target object. Information will be acquired on acuity, contrast sensitivity and depth perception. By enhancing contrast, it is hypothesized that the ability of those with AD to conduct visual search under naturalistic conditions will be improved. This information can be used to develop effective intervention strategies aimed at sustaining independent activities of daily living and improving the quality of life of the elderly and individuals with AD.           n/a",Visual Cognition and Daily Function in AD and PD,7112653,F31NS051083,"['clinical research', 'cognition', 'computers', 'conditioning', 'functional ability', 'perception', 'vision']",NINDS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2006,30424,0.11617635704944747
"Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of Elderly Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia The objective of the proposed direct Phase-II SBIR project is to develop and study and the effectiveness of Serious Games and physical Activities played/performed by elderly people with Alzheimer’s disease and AD- related Dementias in interaction with Ryan, our successfully piloted Socially Assistive Robot (SAR). Ryan is an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with AD/ADRD. Ryan uses state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology for automated facial expression recognition, natural language processing, and tracking of human body that are used in personalization and adaptation of the games and physical activities. According to the Alzheimer’s Association an estimated 5.7 million Americans have AD and is projected to rise to 13.8 million, as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. While SAR research prototypes exist that can interact with users playing physical cognitive games equipped with artificial intelligence technology and personalization, to our knowledge, no such cooperative SAR (prototype or commercial) for electronic gameplay with individuals suffering from dementia exists today. Our game designs will target “Cognition”, “Memory”, “Spatial Relation”, “Social Relationship”, and “Motor Skills” abilities of players. We will conduct a pilot study to measure Ryan’s effectiveness in mental and socio- emotional stimulation of users with mild dementia. This innovative technology stands to produce significant financial savings and improve the quality of life of individuals living with AD/ADRD, their families, and caregivers. The goal of the project is to develop serious games and physical activities co-played by a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of Elderly Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia,10020305,R44AG066439,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Control Groups', 'Cost of Illness', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hobbies', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motor Skills', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Well-Being', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'active control', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'common symptom', 'community living', 'cost', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'exergame', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prototype', 'repetitive behavior', 'skeletal movement', 'skills', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'social relationships', 'success', 'tool']",NIA,"DREAM FACE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2020,536476,0.16576723216111747
"Ultrascale Machine Learning to Empower Discovery in Alzheimers Disease Biobanks ABSTRACT In response to PAR-19-269 “Cognitive Systems Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Genetic and Phenotypic Data (U01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)”, our project unites experts in AD genomics, machine learning and AI (including deep learning), large-scale data integration, and international data harmonization to work in a carefully-designed Consortium Structure in close partnership with the NIH, ADSP, and NIAGADS. We will develop a suite of complementary big data analytic approaches for ultra-scale analysis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) genomic and phenotypic data. The vast data volumes now generated by the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Accelerating Medications Partnership AD (AMP-AD), and UK Biobank (UKBB), far exceed the capacity of all current analytic methods, which have not kept pace with the scale and speed of data collection. This vast amount of genetic and phenotypic data mandates new and more powerful algorithms to: (1) store, manage, and manipulate whole-genome sequences and associated data on an ever-growing scale; (2) discover novel AD risk and protective loci by merging informatics and AD genomics databases; (3) relate whole-genome changes to the ATN(v) biomarkers that now define biological AD. Our Ultrascale Machine Learning Initiative, or “ULTRA” - will offer new AI and deep learning tools to discover features in massive scale genomics data - relating whole genome data to biomarker features by merging all relevant data sources. Our team of experienced PIs will coordinate efforts across the U.S. to create these large-scale data analytic tools. Our MPI team and 6 Core Leads have decades of experience working together and with the AD community in pioneering machine learning methods for AD genetics and neuroimaging, including leadership of international neuroimaging consortia across the world. Dedicated Cores focus on Genomic, Imaging, and Cognitive Data Harmonization. Curated data will then be efficiently imported into AI approaches and informatics pipelines that will allow the AD research community to leverage ultra-scale, multidimensional genomic and phenotypic data from the ADSP, NACC, ADNI, AMP-AD, and others. Our work is organized by a carefully-designed and coordinated Consortium guided by all stake-holders, clinical leaders, and pioneering analysts in AD genomics and neuroimaging. Our ultrascale AI tools will advance AD genomics research and will include efforts in training, and a dedicated Drug Repurposing Core. This team effort will accelerate understanding of the genetic, molecular and neurobiological mechanisms of AD, yielding significant translational impact on disease and drug development. NARRATIVE Our Ultrascale Machine Learning Initiative, or “ULTRA” - is a coordinated national initiative to develop transformative AI approaches for high throughput analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) and related AD biomarker and cognitive data. Biomarker data related to AD are being collected at “ultra-scale” and are likely to unlock numerous opportunities for AD treatment, yet the rapid collection of such data far exceed our current capacity to analyze it. Our collective effort in this proposal will sieve extensive genomic, biomarker, and cognitive data to extract and prioritize the features that are essential to address fundamental barriers to AD prevention and drug discovery.",Ultrascale Machine Learning to Empower Discovery in Alzheimers Disease Biobanks,10028746,U01AG068057,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical subtypes', 'cloud based', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'data curation', 'data dissemination', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic signature', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'genomic predictors', 'hazard', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informatics tool', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2020,3767729,0.27117952772354864
"Physical Fitness as an Objective Biomarker for AD/ADRD Risk Modification About 6M Americans ≥65 years suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) which poses significant emotional, physical, and financial burden on patients and their families, and costs the US economy over $250 billion annually. AD/ADRD is a growing national public health crisis as the number of Americans ≥65 years is projected to double by 2050. There are no approved disease-modifying drugs for AD/ADRD, and no new symptom-modifying drug has been approved since 2003. This highlights the need for novel research approaches aimed at preventing AD/ADRD. Physical activity (PA) has been identified as the lifestyle intervention with the strongest potential to prevent AD/ADRD. However, most of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PA including the 23 ongoing RCTs currently sponsored by the NIA are small with short follow-up. Larger RCTs with longer follow-up are needed to provide definitive evidence of benefit. Identification of relevant biomarkers and quantification of future risk can mitigate long duration and cost of such RCTs. Epidemiologic studies with large database and long follow-up are limited by imprecise and unreliable self-reports of PA. We propose the novel concept of using cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a reliable biomarker of PA for AD/ADRD risk reduction. Like body composition, blood pressure and heart rate, CRF is considered a biomarker of PA. Just as well-controlled blood glucose leads to optimal HbA1C, PA of adequate duration, frequency and intensity also leads to optimal CRF. The current application has been designed to test the hypotheses that higher CRF is independently linked to a lower risk of incident AD/ADRD and to determine optimal levels of CRF assessed by a standardized exercise tolerance test (ETT), for minimizing AD/ADRD risk at both population and individual levels. Our Specific Aims are (1) to determine the relationship between CRF and incident AD/ADRD, taking into consideration a non-linear relationship and potential interactions of CRF with other risk factors and (2) to define incremental CRF levels that are linked to progressively lower risk of AD/ADRD, overall, and in subgroups by age, sex, and race. Our Aim 3 is to develop and validate a deep learning-based risk prediction model to determine the optimal CRF level for individuals to achieve the lowest risk of AD/ADRD. Recent advances in deep (machine) learning, a key artificial intelligence (AI) technology, allow modeling of complex non-linear relationships necessary for more precise risk prediction. These aims will be achieved by using ETT data on 911,698 Veterans free of baseline AD/ADRD (mean age, 61 years, 54,411 women, 202,000 African American, 50,107 Hispanic Americans) with up to 19 years of follow-up data. Explainable deep learning risk prediction model will be developed in the VA data, and validated with a Medicare population to develop a “precision medicine” approach that will personalize CRF recommendations for individuals to lower their AD/ADRD risk. Future studies will incorporate molecular biomarkers to validate AD diagnosis and ascertain effect of CRF and CRF modification on AD risk. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) affects about 6 million Americans ≥65 years but to date there are no drug that can cure it and no new drug to improve memory and function has been discovered in nearly past two decades. Physical activity is the only lifestyle intervention with the greatest potential to prevent AD/ADRD, but clinical trials of physical activity are often small with short follow-up, and self-reports of physical activity in observation studies are unreliable. We propose to use objectively measured cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a biomarker of physical activity in the largest epidemiological study to date in nearly 1 million Veterans using VA’s world-class electronic health record and advanced artificial intelligence technologies.",Physical Fitness as an Objective Biomarker for AD/ADRD Risk Modification,10055393,RF1AG069121,"['Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Exercise Tolerance', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart Rate', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Research', 'Prevention trial', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sample Size', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cardiorespiratory fitness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'lifestyle intervention', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'risk mitigation', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'statistical learning', 'systematic review', 'unstructured data']",NIA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,2005396,0.2419239179419955
"A Specialized Automatic Speech Recognition and Conversational Platform to Enable Socially Assistive Robots for Persons with Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Abstract 1 in 3 seniors in the United States dies with dementia, of which Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form. AD patients suffer from decreased ability to meaningfully communicate and interact, which causes significant stress and burden for both professional caregivers and family members. Socially assistive robots (SARs) have been designed to promote therapeutic interaction and communication. Unfortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) has long been challenged by the speech of elderly persons, who exhibit age-related voice tremors, hesitations, imprecise production of consonants, increased variability of fundamental frequency, and other barriers that can be exacerbated by the neurological changes associated with AD, further complicated by common environmental noises such as the ceiling fan, television, etc. Because of the resulting poor real-world speech and language understanding by available SAR technologies, scarce human caregivers are often required to guide AD patients through SAR interactions, limiting SARs to small deployments, mostly as part of research studies. Unlike existing approaches relying purely on AI, care.coach™ is developing a SAR-like avatar that converses with elderly and AD patients through truly natural speech. Each avatar is controlled by a 24x7 team of trained human staff who can cost-effectively monitor and engage 12 or more patients sequentially (2 simultaneously) through the audio/visual feeds from the patient’s avatar device. The staff communicate with each patient by sending text commands which are converted into the avatar’s voice through a speech synthesis engine. The staff contribute to the system their human abilities for speech and natural language processing (NLP) and for generating free-form conversational responses to help patients build personal relationships with the avatar. The staff are guided by a software-driven expert system embedded into their work interface, which is programmed with evidence-based prompting and protocols to support healthy behaviors and self-care. This SBIR Fast-Track project will leverage the unique data generated by our human- in-the-loop platform to develop new ASR capabilities, enabling fully automatic conversational protocols to engage and support AD patients without human intervention. We aim in Phase I to leverage our unique prior work dataset to train an automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine to enable the understanding of certain types of elderly and AD patient speech more successfully than any currently available engine. We aim in Phase II to incorporate this new engine along with an NLP module into our existing human-in-the-loop avatar system, recruiting a population of AD patients to further train and validate with during a 2-year human subjects study so that we can demonstrate full automation of a significant portion of our avatar conversations with mild- to-moderate level AD patients. Thus, we will improve the commercial scalability of our avatars, while validating our new ASR/NLP engine as the most accurate platform for enabling the next generation of AD-focused SARs. Narrative Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been challenged by the speech of elderly persons, and especially persons with dementia, due to age-related voice tremors, hesitations, imprecise production of consonants, increased variability of fundamental frequency, and other barriers. Unlike existing approaches to socially assistive robots (SARs) relying purely on limited AI for conversation, care.coach™ has been commercializing a SAR-like avatar that converses with elderly and AD patients through truly natural speech, powered by a 24x7 team of trained human staff. The unique data sets that our solution enables us to gather at commercial scale will be leveraged in this SBIR project to develop an automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) engine that is best-in-class for AD applications, improving the commercial scalability of our avatars by reducing our dependence on human staff, while serving as a new AI platform for enabling the next generation of AD- focused, conversational SARs.",A Specialized Automatic Speech Recognition and Conversational Platform to Enable Socially Assistive Robots for Persons with Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia,10230460,R44AG062014,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Exhibits', 'Expert Systems', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feeds', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Jamaica', 'Label', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Loneliness', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Price', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Self Care', 'Semantics', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Washington', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'age related', 'aging population', 'automated speech recognition', 'care providers', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'health plan', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'next generation', 'older patient', 'patient engagement', 'patient response', 'phrases', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'restraint', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'social assistive robot', 'speech recognition', 'speech synthesis', 'success', 'usability']",NIA,CARE.COACH CORPORATION,R44,2020,1502690,0.018075766363355554
"GaitIQ: Establishing a Digital Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Early detection of pre-clinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) during the long latent period prior to manifest dementia offers significant opportunities to advance the development of disease modifying interventions and effectively slow the disease’s progression. To achieve this objective, there is a critical need for new technologies that accelerate the development of biomarkers with high sensitivity for underlying AD pathology. A highly promising biomarker for preclinical AD is gait, as subtle gait changes have been correlated with elevated amyloid burden and cortical atrophy. While even simple measures of gait speed predict incident dementia in older adults, current research indicates that preclinical AD pathology is more precisely captured by a combination of 3D kinematic and spatio-temporal measures. A cost-effective mobile application that can be used in clinical trials and by healthcare personnel to capture these parameters efficiently, combined with a validated system to translate the measures to quantifiable AD risk in minutes, would result in a paradigm shift in availability of AD screening for at-risk individuals. GaitIQ™ is an innovative digital health startup company developing an online software-based product that employs computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) to compute clinically accurate spatio-temporal and 3D kinematic data, from a simple video of a person walking. GaitIQTM collaborates with The Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio and Southwest Research Institute for this SBIR project. The expected outcome is that advanced kinematic/spatio-temporal measures of gait captured by the GaitIQTM system will reveal a sensitive and specific gait signature with high diagnostic accuracy for pre-clinical AD in a sample of Hispanic older adults. The project will develop and validate the capacity of GaitIQ™ to detect a digital gait biomarker signature that distinguishes between individuals with preclinical AD and controls. The final digital platform will be an easy-to-use, powerful tool to identify and monitor patients with pre-clinical AD using just an iPad/tablet to video their gait and submit it for analysis in the cloud by GaitIQTM sophisticated, proprietary analysis software. Changes in a patient’s walking gait can reveal important early signs of AD decades before cognitive symptoms are observed. GaitIQ™ is a San Antonio-based startup company focused on developing an early-stage digital health software technology that leverages novel machine vision, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics.

"Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an urgent national and international research priority. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark of AD. Their building blocks are Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, respectively. At present, we lack an understanding of the set of genes that affect formation of plaques and tangles along with protective and pathological responses to these toxic peptides. Biologists are now gathering gene expression data and Aβ and tau measures from human brain tissues. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (here, gene expression levels) that best predict an outcome (Aβ or tau level). The identified features, biomarkers, can help determine the molecular basis for plaques and tangles. Unfortunately, false positive biomarkers are very common, as evidenced by low success rates of replication in independent data and low success reaching clinical practice (less than 1%). We seek to radically shift the current paradigm in biomarker discovery by resolving three fundamental problems with the current approach using novel, theoretically well-founded machine learning (ML) methods to learn interpretable models from data. Aim 1. Learn an interpretable feature representation from publicly available, high-throughput brain data. High-dimensionality, hidden variables, and complex feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., observed statistical associations) and true biological interactions. To increase the chance to identify true positive biomarkers, we need new feature selection criteria to learn a model that better explains rather than simply predicts the outcome. To do so, our proposed ML algorithms will identify the genes that are likely to give a meaningful explanation of the outcome (Aβ or tau level) by inferring both the functions of genes in the cellular processes contributing to AD and the gene interaction network from many existing brain datasets. Aim 2. Make interpretable predictions using a unified framework to explain model predictions. Due to disease heterogeneity, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) often more accurately describe relationships between genes and an outcome than simpler, linear models, but lack interpretability. We will develop a novel ML framework that interprets complex model predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a specific prediction, which will identify features of high importance for each individual as personalized markers and classify subjects based on these importance estimates. Aim 3. Validate the identified candidate biomarkers using powerful worm models of AD. Analyzing observational data without doing interventional experiments cannot prove causal relationships. In collaboration with co-I Matt Kaeberlein, we will utilize powerful nematode models of AD to test our hypotheses on the role of certain genes as disease modifiers, and develop a new way to refine the models based on this knowledge. Successful completion of this project will result in previously unknown molecular basis for Aβ and tau levels, potential therapeutic targets, and general ML techniques widely applicable to many other data science problems. Project Narrative In the United States alone, someone receives an Alzheimer’s diagnosis every 66 seconds, and the disease has become the 6th leading cause of death in this country; Alzheimer’s disease (AD) currently has no cure, no prevention, and no treatment to reverse or halt its deadly progression. The recent, rapid growth of gene expression data from human brain tissues hold great promise for identifying therapeutic targets, but extremely low success rates to identify true positive biomarkers indicate fundamental problems with the current computational approach being used. We seek to revolutionize the way we identify drug targets by developing novel machine learning techniques that extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data, combined with biological validation in an animal model of AD.",Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets,9864003,R01AG061132,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'Network-based', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Oral', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'RNA Interference', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Selection Criteria', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain tissue', 'candidate marker', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'direct application', 'disease heterogeneity', 'drug response prediction', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'proteostasis', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,582016,0.11829068884411224
"Multi-Modality Image Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approaches for Personalized Diagnostics and Prognostics of MCI due to AD Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease. The greatest treatment potential lies in early stages before irreversible brain damage occurs. Early treatment requires early detection of the disease. Imaging holds great promise for capturing early signs of AD. This capability can be substantially strengthened by integrating neuroimages of different modalities that characterize brain structure and function from complementary aspects. However, although various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to integrate multi-modality images for diagnosis and prognosis of AD, there is a lack of novel, robust, effective algorithms to address patient-wise missing modalities in the integration. In real clinical data, it is inevitable that some image modalities are unavailable to some patients due to high cost, insurance coverage, and safety constraints. Thus, the existing algorithms may only work for a small portion of patients who have complete modalities. This significantly reduces the access to advanced imaging-based diagnostic systems from the general patient population and in broad clinical settings. Because of the limited clinical utility, it is difficult to commercialize the existing ML algorithms into clinical systems/products, whereas the current imaging-based products on the market focus on single image modalities or image measurement, processing, visualization, and statistical analysis (without advanced ML capabilities). To fill the unmet market niche, this STTR Phase II project will develop the first-ever broadly-applicable clinical decision support system, Multi-neuroimaging for Detecting AD (Mind-AD), which can accommodate varying availability of image modalities across different patients to build classifiers and provide accurate diagnosis and prognosis of AD for each individual at the early MCI stage. Our Phase I has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the Mind-AD system. At Phase II, we propose functional optimization and validation of Mind-AD in three aims. Aim 1 will optimize the accuracy and robustness of the diagnostic/prognostic models by integrating our Phase I IMTL model with efficient PSO feature selection. The integrated IMTL-PSO is very efficient in selecting optimal feature subsets to yield accurate, robust diagnostic/prognostic models especially on independent validation datasets. Aim 2 will develop a novel IMTL- DL (deep learning) model to integrate incomplete multi-modality volumetric images. While IMTL-PSO is based on features defined using anatomical knowledge of the brain, IMTL-DL extracts features in a data-driven manner. Aim 3 will integrate IMTL-PSO and IMTL-DL through decision fusion to best leverage their complementary, joint strength, and validate the resulting Mind-AD system using two independent datasets. Our project is significant because Mind-AD is the first early diagnostic/prognostic system for AD using advanced ML algorithms to integrate incomplete multi-modality image datasets. Mind-AD will facilitate early detection, early intervention, patient selection in drug trials targeting the early stage, and will help achieve these goals in in broad clinical settings due to the capability of accommodating varying availability of image modalities from different patients. The public health relevance of this project is to provide a clinical decision support system, Mind-AD, to facilitate accurate diagnosis and prognosis of AD at the early stage, through novel machine learning integration of multi- modality image datasets with patient-specific missing modalities. Early detection and early intervention bear the greatest potential for combating this devastating disease. Therefore, our system helps address the serious public health concern regarding AD which currently affects over 5.5 million people and incurs over $200 billion health care cost per year in the US.",Multi-Modality Image Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approaches for Personalized Diagnostics and Prognostics of MCI due to AD,10156662,R42AG053149,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Family health status', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical application', 'combat', 'cost', 'data fusion', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'feature extraction', 'feature selection', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'search engine', 'targeted therapy trials', 'therapy development', 'trend']",NIA,MS TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION,R42,2020,1252970,0.21658962352434594
"The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents Abstract: Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the US and epidemiological data suggests they are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and have a higher occurrence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). AD is defined neuropathologically by the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques. In addition to these hallmarks, many AD patients have mixed neuropathologies, including Lewy bodies (LBs) and pathological indices of CVD. Studies, involving mainly NHWs, have shown associations of these neuropathologies with clinical, genetic, and demographic variables providing insights into disease mechanisms and prevention strategies. However, there is a relative dearth of neuropathology studies on Hispanics. It is imperative to have neuropathology studies with individuals having diverse characteristics as this maximizes variability allowing for better identification of disease risk factors for more precision in development of preventative measures. This study will examine the neuropathologic landscape (the presence, location, and density of NFTs, plaques, CVD and LBs) of Hispanics compared to NHWs and determine if this landscape is altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables. To achieve efficiencies in time and further measurement precision we will enhance and adapt innovative machine learning algorithms to narrow in on pathology location and provide more quantitative analyses. Based on previous findings our central hypothesis is that Hispanics will have different neuropathologic landscapes when compared to NHWs and these differences are influenced by underlying risk factors, especially cardiovascular risk factors. Our specific aims are to: 1) profile the presence, location, and semi-quantitative densities of NFTs, plaques, LBs, and pathological indices of CVD in the setting of AD in Hispanics compared to NHWs, 2) profile and determine if pathologic measures from Aim 1 are altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables (APOE status, Hispanic origin, age at death, clinical history of cerebrovascular events (i.e. stroke), hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, sex, and/or education) and 3) strengthen and adapt a deep learning pipeline for quantifying AD pathologies. We will capitalize on existing well-characterized resources within three Alzheimer’s disease centers at University of California- Davis, the University of California- San Diego, and Columbia that contain a diverse autopsy confirmed AD Hispanic and NHW cohort. Also, we will use machine learning resources at the University of California San Francisco. This proposal will be the first largescale initiative to delineate the neuropathology in over 100 Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican origins compare to over 200 NHWs and determine the impact of comorbid risk factors. Profiling neuropathologic landscapes and understanding underlying factors has potential to shed light on mechanistic differences in disease development leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. Results will directly advance understanding of brain health (pathology) in an important and growing part of the elderly population that to date there is miniscule neuropathology information.

"FiberNET: Deep learning to evaluate brain tract integrity worldwide and in AD ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) threatens to devastate society worldwide. For every 5 years of age over age 65, the prevalence of AD doubles, costing an estimated $277 billion in the U.S. in 2018, a $20 billion increase from the previous year. Here we propose a coordinated global study of brain aging and AD, that uses novel approaches to assess the white matter microstructure of the brain’s neural pathways - a crucial brain metric that breaks down on the pathway from molecular AD pathology to clinical decline. With a novel deep learning tool, called FiberNET, we extract and analyze the brain’s white matter fiber bundles obtained from diffusion MRI (dMRI) scans across the world, and answer 3 key questions: how do the brain’s tracts age worldwide? How does tract aging depend on sex, Alzheimer’s genetic risk, and brain amyloid load? Can tract metrics predict clinical decline better, when combined with standard, accepted biomarkers of AD? The proposal unites experts in AD, neuroimaging, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, to relate new aging metrics (tract microstructure) to protective and adverse factors. Novel mathematics include innovations in picking up crossing fibers and tissue properties from multi- shell diffusion MRI, and convolutional neural nets to learn patterns of aging in neural pathways worldwide. We aim to (1) use FiberNET, our deep learning method, to extract tracts from brain dMRI scans worldwide, and create normative charts for normal tract aging in 20,000 people across the lifespan; (2) ask how the tract aging trajectory depends on sex, the AD protective genotype APOE2, risk genotype APOE4, and brain amyloid load measured with amyloid-sensitive PET. The proposed study will create standardized charts of white matter tract integrity across the lifespan to serve as a guidepost for normative white matter aging. We build on our ENIGMA- Lifespan work - which analyzed brain MRI data from 10,144 people from 91 cohorts - to create lifespan charts for the brain’s major tracts from dMRI, yielding fundamental normative information for comparisons of AD groups worldwide. This lifespan approach will aid the discovery of personal factors that accelerate aging relative to population norms (e.g., sex, APOE genotype, and amyloid load). To ensure the impact of the developments, we created a team of beta-testers to help test and refine the methods, that is tightly integrated into our ENIGMA consortium, which is dedicated to cross-cohort data harmonization. This global approach to aging and AD will offer a new source of power to “break the logjam” in discovering factors that affect the brain as we age. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a global study of aging and Alzheimer’s disease to examine the aging of the brain’s tracts, or neural pathways, and relate their degeneration to important protective factors and risk factors. We develop new measures of brain aging, based on the white matter fibers in the brain; we ask how their aging trajectory is shifted by sex, genetic risk for AD, and amyloid levels in the brain. This global approach will give scientists a new source of power to “break the logjam” in discovering factors that affect the brain’s neural pathways as we age.",FiberNET: Deep learning to evaluate brain tract integrity worldwide and in AD,10052154,RF1AG057892,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Gold', 'Haplotypes', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neural Pathways', 'Obesity', 'Parietal', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Power Sources', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abeta deposition', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'biobank', 'brain tract', 'brain volume', 'burden of illness', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost estimate', 'data harmonization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'global health', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging biomarker', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'men', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neural tract', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'polygenic risk score', 'protective factors', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter damage', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,RF1,2020,2563788,0.10203642502127322
"Predictive analytics for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is a major global healthcare burden. However, there is still no effective disease modifying therapy for AD and clinical trials with the aim of preventing or stabilizing cognitive impairment have largely failed. Decision making in both clinical practice and research is highly dependent on practical predictive tools, which can effectively predict cognitive or functional outcomes in individuals. Such models could be potentially used in clinical research to boost the power of trials by enrollment of participants who are most likely to show disease progression during the trial’s timeframe. Alternatively, these models could be used to identifying individuals who would benefit from primary or secondary prevention once there are effective treatments for AD. In this project, we aim to provide a framework for practical prediction of cognitive decline with aging and prodromal AD, by applying a novel ML framework to multiple dimensions of data (demographics, genetic risk scores, neuropsychological measures, structural MRI, and amyloid imaging). Our ultimate goal is to arrive at a new “Machine Learning predictive framework for aging and AD” (ML4AD), comprised of dimensions each of which each will add incremental value to the predictive models, hence increasing the performance of predictive models while keeping the costs and burden of research at a minimum. The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23), Dr. Ali Ezzati, is a Neurologist whose career goal is to develop predictive tools to help research and clinical decision making in cognitive aging and dementia. The proposed research will leverage the rich clinical and biomarker dataset available from several ongoing international studies, but will also provide a unique avenue of investigation for the candidate. The candidate's career development will benefit from close mentorship and scientific guidance of outstanding investigators in aging/AD neurobiology (Dr. Lipton), machine learning and computational neuroscience (Dr. Davatzikos), and biostatistics (Dr. Hall). The findings from this study will inform future secondary prevention trials, in which sensitive indicators of early AD will be necessary to identify high-risk subjects and track early clinical decline. This work will serve as the foundation to move forward in independent research focusing on development of predictive tools in AD and related neurodegenerative disorders. Key words: Alzheimer’s Disease, Dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Cognitive neurology, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, Longitudinal Cohort, Big Data Project Narrative This project aims to develop new models for prediction of cognitive outcomes including cognitive change and incident Alzheimer’s disease. Prediction models will be developed by applying advanced machine learning techniques to high-dimensional data including clinical, neuropsychological, genetic, and biomarker data. This approach will lead to predictive tools that can be effectively used in research as well as clinical decision making for patients in prodromal stages of Alzheimer’s disease or individuals with normal cognition and high-risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease.",Predictive analytics for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease,9976247,K23AG063993,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention trial', 'Primary Prevention', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'aged', 'amyloid imaging', 'arm', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computational neuroscience', 'cost', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prodromal Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'prognostic', 'research study', 'structured data', 'success']",NIA,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K23,2020,197640,0.13591170279073997
"Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease This research project tackles the NIH/NIA grand challenge of using a person's own vehicle as a passive-detection system for flagging potential age- and disease-related aberrant driving that may signal early warning signs of functional decline or incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early identification and treatment are essential steps to mitigating the growing costs and burden of AD. Our foundational advancements in quantifying driver behavior from in-vehicle systems (""Black Boxes"") and wearable sensors, and strategic analytic methods and pipelines using statistical and machine learning approaches, are directly relevant to meeting this NIH/NIA challenge. The proposal builds strategically on current project discoveries and successes that comprehensively characterized patterns of real-world driving exposure and risk in 136 older drivers across 500,000 miles driven. Under the proposal's conceptual framework, functional abilities determine specific driver behavior patterns and errors. Behaviors, in tum, index driver functional abilities and clinical features of NIA-Alzheimer's Association (AA) core clinical criteria of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (operationalized by Alzheimer's clinical syndrome [ACS]). Sleep and mobility play roles as key mediators of relationships between driver behavior and functional impairment. Accordingly, our Specific Aims (SA) are: SA1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a continuous, 3-month, baseline period that classify normally aging, MCI, and ACS drivers by NIA-AA core clinical criteria. SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility factors, collected over a continuous, 3-month baseline period, mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features (SA1). SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (SA 1) and real-world sleep and mobility (SA2) to detect clinical feature severity of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. To address these aims, our team of experts-in medicine, AD, driving in aging and disease, cognitive neuroscience, transportation engineering, machine learning, computer vision, and longitudinal biostatistics--will apply our approach to drivers with a broader range of impairments across the aging to AD spectrum. A total of 180 drivers, ages 65- 90 years, who have ACS (N=40), MCI (N=80), or are normally aging (N=60) based on NIA-AA clinical criteria will be studied across a 3-month baseline period of real-world naturalistic driver behavior, sleep, and mobility monitoring. Two longitudinal assessments, each 1 year apart, will comprehensively assess each driver's risk for and severity of functional decline. By extracting ""digital fingerprints"" of aberrant driver behavior in drivers al risk for AD, this project complements seismic advances in biologic diagnosis of preclinical AD and advances NIH priorities lo improve older driver safely, mobility, quality of life, with unprecedented access lo diagnostic care. Passive monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status in individuals at risk for AD directly promotes interventions aimed at early treatment of and preventing progression of AD in its preclinical stages. The goal of this research project is to address the NIH and NIA's grand challenge of using a person's own vehicle as a passive-detection system for flagging potential age- and/or disease-related aberrant driving behaviors that may signal early warning signs of functional decline of Alzheimer's disease (AD), even before standard clinical tests do so. Our Specific Aims will assess and combine key factors affecting driver behavior and clinical status in aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS) as markers and moderators of risk: SA 1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a 3-month continuous, baseline period that classify NIA-AA core clinical criteria of MCI and ACS in drivers who are normally aging (N = 60), MCI (N = 80), or ACS (N = 40); SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features; SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (from SA 1) and driver sleep and mobility (from SA2) to detect early signs of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. By building on our extensive successes in the current phase, the project directly advances NIH and NIA goals lo detect early warnings signs of decline and incipient AD-with the goal of screening, identifying, and tracking individuals at risk for AD from passive-monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status and progression-promoting early treatment of AD and the next stage of interventions to prevent the progression of AD even in its preclinical stages.",Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease,9973716,R01AG017177,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weather', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cost', 'digital', 'driving behavior', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'older driver', 'older patient', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'rural setting', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'urban setting', 'visual motor', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,954904,0.11680233151570467
"Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes With ageing populations world-wide, neurodegenerative diseases are placing an ever increasing  burden on long- term well-being, healthcare costs and family life. Despite decades of research and  enormous investment, no disease-modifying treatment is available for the most common of these  diseases: Alzheimer’s (AD). The majority of these, to-date unsuccessful, efforts have focused   on one potential cause of AD: amyloid-β aggregation. Combining population-scale data  collection, human genetics and machine learning provides a way forward to uncover and characterize  new causal cellular processes involved in AD. This would provide an array of potential therapeutic  targets, increasing the chance that one will be more easily modulated than the amyloid-β pathway.  AD-specific genomic datasets of unprecedented scale are being actively collected: whole genome  sequencing (WGS) from ~20k individuals, gene expression (RNA-seq) and epigenomics (ATAC-seq,  histone ChIP-seq) from >1000 post-mortem AD brains, single-cell transcriptomes and similar modalities in peripheral and  brain-resident innate immune cells (which we and others have shown to be AD-relevant). Effectively  integrating these diverse data to better understand AD represents a substantial computational  challenge, both in terms of data scale and analysis complexity. This proposal leverages  state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), combined with human genetic  analyses, to address this challenge. We will train DL models to predict epigenomic signals and  RNA splicing from genomic sequence, enabling in silico mutagenesis to estimate the  functional impact (a “delta score”) of any genetic variant. The delta scores will be used in  genetic analyses that distinguish causal associations: cellular changes that drive AD  pathogenesis rather than downstream/side effects of disease. Delta scores will aid in  associating both rare and common variants to AD. To achieve sufficient power, rare variants must be  aggregated (e.g. for a gene): delta scores will allow filtering out many likely non-functional  (particularly non-coding) variants. Most common variants from AD Genome Wide Association Studies  (GWAS) are simply correlated with the causal variant due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Delta  scores, combined with trans-ethnic GWAS, will enable estimation of the likely causal variant(s).  These analyses will highlight variants and genes involved in AD. However, genes do not operate in a  vacuum so robust probabilistic ML will be used to learn cell-type and disease-specific gene  regulatory networks from sorted bulk and single-cell RNA-seq. The detected networks will be  integrated with our genetic findings to discover network neighborhoods/pathways especially  enriched in AD variants. Such pathways will be prime candidates for future functional and  therapeutic studies of AD. The goal of this research is to use machine learning algorithms to work out which  genetic differences in the genomes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients might have  caused their disease. We will do this by learning computational models of how genes are  controlled by genetic sequence and other genes. The proposed study will discover what genes,  pathways and molecular mechanisms are involved in AD, which will provide novel  therapeutic targets for AD patients.",Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes,10045386,U01AG068880,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histones', 'Human Genetics', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vacuum', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abeta accumulation', 'base', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'diverse data', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'frontal lobe', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'in silico', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protective allele', 'protein aggregation', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'side effect', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,1139701,0.1867884381368376
"Correction of Partial Volume Effects in PET for Alzheimer's Disease Using Unsupervised Deep Learning Correction of Partial Volume Effects in PET for Alzheimer's Disease Using Unsupervised Deep Learning Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairments, affects approximately 5.8 million people in the United States. It is a burden for patients, families and the healthcare system. Post-mortem studies reveal that hyperphosphorylated Tau protein aggregates are closely related with AD. With the developments of selective Tau tracers, Tau distributions can now be characterized in vivo through Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. According to the Braak staging, Tau deposits start from the transentorhinal region of the temporal lobe at preclinical AD, then spreading to other cortex regions at late stages. Regional Tau distribution pattern captured through PET Tau imaging can thus provide important staging information, which is vital for early disease diagnosis, progression tracking and treatment monitoring. However, accurate quantification of thin cortex uptake is difficult due to partial volume effects (PVEs) in PET imaging. Besides, for the second- generation Tau tracer, 18F-MK-6240, apart from higher uptakes observed in neocortical and medial temporal brain regions for AD patients, nonspecific uptakes are also observed in areas such as the meninges. Given the thin nature of the cortical ribbon and its close proximity to the meninges, quantitative accuracy and detection precision of 18F-MK-6240 distributions are significantly impacted, which in turn precludes finer localization of early tau accumulation associated with preclinical and prodromal AD. This grant application proposes a novel partial volume correction (PVC) method through unsupervised deep learning for Tau imaging. This new framework does not need high-quality training labels and the network is specifically trained for each subject, with the training objective function formulated based on the Poisson distribution assumption of the sinogram data. To further boost the performance, the transfer learning and the kernel learning are integrated into this PVC framework. The three specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a PET PVC framework based on unsupervised deep learning, (2) to validate the proposed PVC framework using phantom studies and (3) to apply the proposed PVC framework to 18F-MK-6240 imaging datasets. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be an efficient, practical and robust PVC method that can better resolve the Tau distribution patterns for the early diagnosis of AD.

"Advancing Analysis of Multi-omics Data in Alzheimer's Disease Research Project Summary/Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health crisis and a national priority area of high significance. There is a growing recognition that neurodegeneration and AD are multifactorial that may be attributed to harmful changes at multiple levels and AD research must confront the challenge of elucidating the disease mechanisms by leveraging big health data such as -omics data, imaging data, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. To harness the full power of such rich, yet complex health data, powerful statistical and machine learning methods have been developed for risk prediction, clinical decision support, and many other important tasks. However, when applying statistical and machine learning algorithms to such data that are known to contain sensitive information about individuals, it has been widely investigated and recognized that exploiting the output of the algorithms, an adversary may be able to identify some individuals in a particular dataset, thus presenting serious privacy concerns. In addition, there is a growing recognition that powerful statistical and machine learning methods can unintentionally lead to unfair outcomes for some (marginalized) populations, defined by say sex, race/ethnicity or age. While there is a growing body of literature on improving fairness of these algorithms for people across racial, gender and other identities, there has been little work on assessing the impact of missing data on fairness. Plus, the areas of privacy and fairness have been under-investigated in AD research. Building on recent work on privacy and fairness, this project seeks to develop and assess methods for privacy and fairness in analysis of big health data for AD research. Our specific aims are as follows. In Aim 1, we will refine the state-of-the-art Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) method for analysis of big health data such as –omics data, imaging data, EHRs data using statistical and machine learning algorithms, and compare its performance with that of existing methods based on (ε, δ)-DP. In Aim 2, we will assess the impact of missing data on biases in big health datasets and on algorithmic fairness for analysis of big health data for AD, particularly with respect to protected features such as sex and race/ethnicity. In Aim 3, we will assess and compare the impact of existing imputation methods on algorithmic fairness for analysis of big health data for AD, particularly with respect to protected features such as sex and race/ethnicity. This project is expected to fill significant gaps in privacy and fairness for analysis of big health data for AD research that have not been investigated before. The results generated from this study will advance methodology for privacy protection and fairness protection in statistical and machine learning for AD research. Project Narrative This project is expected to fill significant gaps in privacy and fairness for analysis of big health data for AD research that have not been investigated before.

"Rapid Profiling of the Plasma Proteome and Machine Learning Analytics for Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT The main objective of this project is to develop an innovative blood-based test for highly sensitive and specific, non-invasive and cost-efficient diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which would leverage Seer's proprietary Proteograph platform enabled by the convergence of nanotechnology, protein corona, proteomics, and data science. Beyond neuropsychological testing, two approaches have thus far been clinically validated for AD detection, including neuroimaging and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-β or Aβ). In contrast to the neuroimaging (which is expensive and time-consuming) and CSF analysis (which is less expensive, but involves an invasive lumbar puncture procedure), a blood-based test for AD diagnosis has the potential to be dramatically less costly and easier to implement. Nevertheless, the search for reliable blood- based biomarkers has been challenging and the blood-based detection using ELISA or other epitope-based methods that go after a few biomarkers (e.g., Aβ42 or Tau) have not been successful, presumably owing to the vast dynamic range and high complexity of the plasma components. We have recently demonstrated that our multi-nanoparticle (NP) protein corona technology can facilitate broad and deep profiling of plasma proteome, and by combining with machine learning approaches, could lead to the development of Proteograph classifiers for highly accurate detection of different diseases including AD. As compared to current mass spectrometry- based proteomic techniques that require complex and time-consuming depletion or fractionation workflows for detection of low abundance/rare proteins, our multi-NP protein corona strategy is fast and high-throughput for analysis of the vast body of information in the proteome. In this Direct Phase II project, we will build upon the proof-of-concept studies to further test how Seer's Proteograph platform can be applied to develop a robust blood-based test to detect AD. Specifically, we will identify a panel (~6-10) of NPs from Seer's NP library for broad and deep coverage of the plasma proteome of AD patients (Aim 1); develop Proteograph classifiers and identify the proteins critical for classification through machine learning of the proteomic data generated from the panel of NPs with a cohort of 150 plasma samples of AD and healthy controls (Aim 2); and validate the accuracy of the detection test (based on the important proteins identified in Aim 2) in a separate blind cohort of 450 Aβ-positive AD patients and healthy controls (Aim 3). We expect that the successful completion of this SBIR project will lead to the clinical use of a blood-based AD test, which could further benefit earlier treatment, therapeutic outcomes, and health costs and quality of life for the elderly. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 6th-leading cause of death in the United States, and it is projected that nearly 14 million Americans will be living with AD by 2050, according to the Alzheimer's Association, translating to a healthcare cost of ~$1.1 trillion. Accurate and early identification of AD, ideally at the earliest symptomatic or even pre-symptomatic stage, could facilitate better monitoring of therapy response and better planning for the care of family members with the disease, thus offering a tremendous economic impact. In this Direct Phase II SBIR project, we will develop a highly sensitive and specific, non-invasive, and cost-effective blood-based test for routine diagnosis of AD, which represents one of the greatest medical challenges of this era.",Rapid Profiling of the Plasma Proteome and Machine Learning Analytics for Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,10002170,R44AG065051,"['Address', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Fractionation', 'Gender', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuscripts', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Puncture procedure', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'disorder control', 'economic impact', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'nanoparticle', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'therapy outcome']",NIA,"SEER, INC.",R44,2020,910258,0.23215199913978546
"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve access and engagement in AD research among disadvantaged groups.",Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research,9977895,K76AG060005,"['Address', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exclusion', 'Faculty', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired cognition', 'Improve Access', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Readiness', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care episode', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic minority population', 'group intervention', 'health disparity', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'screening', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'success', 'symptom management', 'unstructured data', 'willingness']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K76,2020,230115,0.2509122804076777
"Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting tens of millions of people. A top research priority in AD is to find a biomarker sensitive to early disease and disease progression because that will likely provide the best opportunities for searching and evaluating effective treatments for this currently incurable brain disease. Human brain relies on cerebral blood flow (CBF) for its energy supply and waste removal. Previous research has indicated that CBF reductions cause neuron inactivity and neurotoxic waste accumulation and subsequently neuron death, which may eventually lead to AD dementia. Measuring CBF and following its longitudinal course may then provide a highly potential biomarker for early AD and its progression. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI is a technique for quantifying CBF without using exogenous tracers. Because it is relatively cheaper and can be repeated many times, it is well suited for longitudinal AD research. Sensitivity of ASL MRI to AD and prodromal AD has been shown in many cross-sectional studies (comparing AD to controls) by other groups and us. But several important questions still remain unanswered including the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD and AD progression, the longitudinal CBF change patterns, and sex difference of CBF in AD. Addressing those questions needs large size longitudinal data and expertise for analyzing ASL MRI data due to the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The purpose of this project is to address those open questions by leveraging our extensive expertise on ASL MRI and the accumulating longitudinal ASL data from ADNI (a large ongoing multi-site AD neuroimaging study). The novel information or outcome from this project will include the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD, CBF change rate when disease progresses or reverts, gender effects in AD and its progression, and a next-generation ASL MRI processing algorithm based on deep-machine learning (DL), and a DL-based AD prediction model. We will first confirm our previous ADNI ASL CBF findings using larger sample and updated methods (not available before). We will then check sensitivity of ASL CBF for tracking and predicting disease progression or cognitive declines. Gender effects on CBF in AD will be explicitly examined, which may reveal a clue for the higher prevalence of AD in females. We will revisit those studies using the DL-based ASL denoising algorithm. Pursuing those aims will help establishing ASL CBF as an AD biomarker and provide a versatile AD prediction model using ASL CBF as well as other valuable biomarkers provided in ADNI. Developing and sharing the DL ASL MRI denoising method will benefit not only AD research but also the various scientific projects based on ASL MRI. The feasibility of this innovative but clinically important project is ensured by our decades of experience and the substantial pilot investigations in each aspect of the study, including ASL MRI, AD ASL study, and machine learning. Identifying biomarkers sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its progression is central to AD studies. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) will be measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI and assessed for early AD detection and progression monitoring. We will also develop a next-generation ASL denoising technique to further improve ASL CBF SNR and reliability. Given our aging population and the increasing prevalence of AD, performing this project is likely to have significant public health impact.

"Advancing methods for structural connectome acquisition and estimation in older adults Abstract Diffusion MRI (dMRI) plays critical roles in understanding the neural underpinnings in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Obtaining high quality image with high spatial and q-space resolutions requires prolonged data acquisition, which leads increased mental stress and higher risk of motion artifacts. Acquisition time is a particularly important issue in clinical dMRI in AD and at-risk subjects. But shortening data acquisition time through reducing image resolution will reduce the ability to estimate white matter tracts and degenerate the statistical power. In-plane acceleration (IPA), and simultaneous multislice (SMS), are potential solutions to balance imaging quality and acquisition time. However, IPA and SMS have important limitations, as they require reconstruction methods that introduce noise. The literature studying the impacts of acceleration on dMRI and dMRI-based structural connectome analysis is very limited. Some important questions remain open, including how IPA and SMS affect structural connectome estimation and whether we can further shorten the acquisition time without sacrificing image quality. In this study, we will collect and analyze repeated scans from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, a group at high risk for AD, and age-matched controls. A set of novel statistical methods and toolboxes will be developed to improve both dMRI image reconstruction and connectome estimation and analysis under acceleration. The collected data will be made publicly available. The project has three specific aims: (1) Determine the impact of accelerated imaging on structural connectome (SC) analysis in MCI subjects and age-matched controls. Subjects will have repeated scans under identical acquisition protocols. We will conduct quantitative assessments of reproducibility and discriminative ability of white matter structure and SC. (2) Machine learning reconstruction methods for reducing noise in accelerated dMRI. We will develop machine learning methods to improve vendor-implemented approaches to image reconstruction of k-space data to reduce noise and allow faster acquisition. (3) Develop novel methods for SC estimation and analysis in older adults. Utilizing the output from Aim 2, we will develop novel approaches that can better estimate and analyze SC for older adults. The methodologies developed in this project will facilitate the development of fast and high-quality dMRI acquisition and SC analysis and thus facilitate the development of early imaging biomarkers for AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE We aim to understand how accelerated imaging impacts dMRI data analysis in subjects at-risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We develop new machine learning methods for image reconstruction to overcome the drawbacks of accelerated acquisition. We develop robust structural connectome analysis methods for improved reproducibility. The data and algorithms generated in this study could lead to new practices in clinical neuroimaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), improve our understanding of AD, and allow the development of new early biomarkers.",Advancing methods for structural connectome acquisition and estimation in older adults,9952875,R21AG066970,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Extravasation', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neighborhoods', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vendor', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'early detection biomarkers', 'healthy aging', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2020,438448,0.0880579289859645
"Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a growing epidemic, and potential treatments are unlikely to be effective unless deployed during the earliest stages of AD, prior to cognitive symptoms. Currently there are no inexpensive, non-invasive biomarkers for effective AD screening necessary for early recognition and treatment on a broad scale. Sleep is abnormal in preclinical AD, even prior to cognitive symptoms, and disrupted sleep may in turn accelerate AD pathological mechanisms. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures brain function, and the stereotyped nature of sleep EEG offers a particularly rich opportunity to identify biomarkers of brain dysfunction due to AD. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that sleep-wake brain mechanisms are abnormal very early in AD, and can be detected via subtle but distinct sleep and EEG changes. The objective is to develop sleep and EEG biomarkers of AD, to enable non-invasive and inexpensive screening on a large scale, through the following specific aims.  Aim 1) Identify sleep-wake patterns across the 24-hour day characteristic of AD pathology. Ambulatory sleep-EEG data will be recorded over the 24-hour period in the home setting from a large, diverse, community-based cohort, with the hypothesis that increased sleep-wake transitions over the 24-hour day are characteristic of preclinical-to-mild AD. Aim 2) Assess slow wave integrity measures as biomarkers of AD pathology. EEG abnormalities of slow wave sleep are particularly associated with elevated amyloid-β levels and plaques. Novel analytic techniques will extract bihemispheric slow wave coherence, slow wave velocity, and slow wave intradaily ratio from EEG data collected during sleep and wake. The hypothesis is that amyloid plaques present in early AD will reduce slow wave integrity by all three measures. Aim 3) Determine the EEG signature of AD using machine learning. Machine learning techniques will be applied to EEG from a full attended overnight polysomnogram, to identify a “signature” of AD pathology. The goal is to identify a “signature” that can be detected with spatially limited EEG data that could be collected at home.  The expected outcome of these aims is to identify sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD that can be detected noninvasively and inexpensively at home. The impact of our work will be the ability to screen large populations easily for AD pathology, so that affected individuals can be identified and treated. Moreover, sleep-EEG biomarkers could be used to track disease progression and treatment response in clinical trials for AD. Lastly, since sleep disturbance has a direct effect on AD pathology, by identifying sleep-EEG changes very early in the pathological process, we may be able to intervene, improve sleep, and potentially change the trajectory of AD.  ! Project Narrative Combating the looming crisis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will require identifying and treating individuals with AD even before cognitive symptoms appear. The proposed project will develop sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD in a large, diverse, community-based cohort, which can be used for inexpensive, non-invasive screening for AD on a broad scale. This project will enable large-scale screening and treatment of early AD, use of sleep-EEG theranostic biomarkers for clinical and drug-development purposes, and intervention for sleep disturbances to potentially change the trajectory of AD.",Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,9932299,R01AG059507,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Drug Development', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Napping', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Race', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'combat', 'cost', 'early detection biomarkers', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep onset', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'tau Proteins', 'theranostics', 'treatment response']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,418014,-0.023612987352256875
"Framework for a series of high priority multiscale analyses Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease affecting more than 5 million Americans. Despite significant investment in drug discovery and development, no therapeutic options yet exist that can prevent, slow, or cure AD. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Alzheimer’s Disease Target Discovery and Preclinical Validation project (AMP-AD) was designed to help address this problem by identifying candidate targets through evaluation of AD-induced changes in human molecular state on a systems level. The program uses an open science paradigm to support early, iterative integration of resources and evaluation of findings across multiple independent teams. To extend this work we propose a cross team analytic effort to 1. Create a machine learning model of temporal Alzheimer’s disease progression. 2. Harmonize CNS model of disease progression and peripheral measures of disease state, and 3. Combine heterogeneous biomolecular networks with the molecular model of disease progression for a unified multi-scale model of disease mechanism and progression. This will amplify the impact of the individual team’s efforts, and help disentangle the molecular and temporal complexity of this devastating disease. Narrative AD is a universally fatal disease for which no disease-modifying therapies have been successfully brought to market. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Alzheimer’s Disease Target Discovery and Preclinical Validation project (AMP-AD) is working to use systems biology approaches to identify candidate targets with potential therapeutic impact. By building a unified analytical framework to understand the molecular nature of the disease across multiple data modalities we will better understand early disease mechanisms, identify molecular subtypes of disease and their drivers, and improve the stratification of patients into these subtypes based on peripheral biomarkers.",Framework for a series of high priority multiscale analyses,10071815,U24AG061340,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biological Markers', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Peripheral', 'Resources', 'Series', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'molecular subtypes', 'multi-scale modeling', 'open data', 'patient stratification', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs']",NIA,SAGE BIONETWORKS,U24,2020,156188,0.18698576974771836
"National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, where currently 5.8 million people are living with AD dementias, and this number is projected to almost triple to 13.8 million by 2050. In addition AD and related dementias (AD/ADRD) healthcare costs for people ≥65 years were an estimated $277 billion in 2018. Although putative risk and protective factors have been identified, published studies have been unable to identify how to prevent and mitigate disease progression and who is most vulnerable mostly because the existing studies are based on small sample size and lack statistical power to disentangle the effects of different factors. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (a ubiquitous yet modifiable exposure dangerous to the aging brain) has been associated with decreased cognitive function, faster cognitive decline, dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Toxicological and human studies provide evidence of an association between air pollution and neurodegeneration, highlighting potential biological pathways that include systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. In response to PAR-17-054, our goal is to leverage massive nationwide datasets (Medicare and Medicaid), coupled with advanced statistical methods, to overcome the limitations of existing studies and clarify risk and protective factors for AD/ADRD. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will conduct national epidemiological studies using Medicare and Medicaid claims for the period 2000-2021 for the continental US, to estimate the association between exposure to air pollution and the time to the first AD/ADRD hospitalization. Among enrollees that have been hospitalized for AD/ADRD or MCI we will assess whether air pollution exposure increases risk of mortality, and/or accelerates re-hospitalization for AD/ADRD. In Aim 2 we will apply machine learning methods to identify co-occurrence of individual-level (previous hospitalizations, race, age, and sex), environmental (weather, green space, and noise), and SES risk (or protective) factors to determine which population subgroups are most/least at risk for AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression following air pollution exposure. In Aim 3 we will develop methods to overcome statistical challenges including (1) disentangle the effects of air pollution exposure from other confounding factors by leveraging approaches for causal inference, and (2) correct for potential outcome misclassification. We will conduct side-by-side epidemiological analyses using traditional methods (e.g. regression) and causal inference and machine learning approaches to understand which statistical challenges require more sophisticated approaches. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we will provide peer-reviewed open-source software so other investigators may implement our methods. In summary the results of this proposal will characterize the link between air pollution exposure and AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression, will identify the multiple modifiable risk and protective factors that determine vulnerability in AD/ADRD, and provide the foundation for implementable actions to prevent and reduce this enormous health burden. This project will leverage data on two cohorts (Medicaid and Medicare enrollees) to characterize the impact of air pollution on risk for and progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), and identify the complex interactions of individual-level, environmental and societal factors that lead to increased vulnerability in AD/ADRD. We will develop innovative, transparent, and reproducible methods to address current statistical challenges including outcome misclassification. We will determine the impact of multiple inter-related environmental protective and risk factors to address the multi-factorial AD/ADRD health burden.","National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution",9942956,R01AG066793,"['Address', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Biological', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Ozone', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Side', 'Societal Factors', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weather', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'fine particles', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nanoparticle', 'open source', 'prevent', 'protective factors', 'response', 'sex', 'socioeconomics']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2020,802617,0.23641984249013404
"Multiband ASL for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia with enormous healthcare burden. Identification of preclinical disease is critical for the development of therapy, as significant neuronal death has already occurred by the time of symptom onset. Arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is an appealing approach for measuring perfusion in dementia by utilizing magnetically labeled arterial blood water as an endogenous tracer. We and others have applied ASL to study AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Characteristic patterns of cerebral hypoperfusion in temporoparietal association cortices, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus and frontal cortex were detected using ASL in AD patients, and to a lesser extent, in MCI populations. However, there remain several challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, including: 1) Existing ASL techniques generally have a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, making it difficult to decompose structural and functional components of neurodegenerative effects due to partial volume effects; 2) The recommended implementation of pseudo- continuous ASL (pCASL) with segmented 3D acquisition is susceptible to (inter-segment) head motion that is frequently present in aged populations; and 3) The relatively long duration of segmented 3D acquisition generally allows a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan, which is susceptible to age dependent variations in arterial transit time, affecting the accuracy of perfusion quantification. The goal of the parent R01 project (EB028297 “Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study”) was to develop and evaluate cutting-edge multiband (MB) pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi- delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. During this project, we will apply cutting edge high-resolution 2D and 3D MB pCASL techniques and deep-learning (DL) denoising algorithms in 3 groups of mild AD, amnestic MCI and age matched control subjects, and compare the results with those by standard pCASL methods. We hypothesize that the developed MB pCASL protocols and DL algorithms are more sensitive than standard pCASL techniques for detecting perfusion differences between mild AD, MCI and control subjects. The successful completion of this project will lead to robust high resolution multi-delay MB pCASL protocols with associated DL denoising algorithms which may serve as biomarkers for AD and MCI. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia with enormous healthcare burden. This project will evaluate cutting edge high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to noninvasively detect cerebral blood flow reductions in elderly humans with mild AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

"Plasma Cell-Free RNA as Non-invasive Biomarker for Neurodegeneration Project Summary / Abstract Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Pathological changes in the brain can be observed at least 15 years before clinical symptoms (preclinical stage). An early and accurate diagnosis tool could save $7.9 trillion in medical and care costs. Moreover, an effective therapeutic strategy could improve the clinical outcome if delivered early. There is a clear need to develop cost-effective and non-invasive biomarkers for AD that can be used to identify individuals before symptoms emerge and patients at early-symptomatic stages of disease. These novel biomarkers could be also leveraged to monitor disease progression and responses to therapies. Cell-free nucleic acids diagnostic tests have revolutionized prenatal screening, and cancer research, diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, specific transcripts ascertained from cell-free RNA have been evaluated as biomarkers for AD, but so far, no high throughput approach has been attempted. The goal of this proposal is to use high throughput sequencing of cell-free nucleic acids from plasma to construct a prediction model for neurodegenerative diseases. I hypothesize that there are detectable changes in plasma cell-free nucleic acids that are related to AD. During the K99 phase, I aim to predict accurately AD cases using cell-free nucleic acid and bioinformatics tools, including machine learning. Briefly, I will sequence cell-free RNA present in longitudinal samples of plasma from AD cases and controls, then build a predictive model. I will replicate this model in an independent dataset of preclinical samples. I will include samples from mutation carriers and non-European ancestry to validate the model. I will also determine if the model can predict other neurodegenerative diseases or if it is specific to AD by quantifying plasma transcripts from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. My preliminary data show that this approach is feasible. I designed a preliminary predictive model with 10 AD cases and 10 controls that has an area under the ROC curve of 1; then I replicated it in independent samples (n=20) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.84. In four preclinical samples the ROC was 0.86 suggesting that my model can also identify pre-symptomatic individuals. It is possible to improve this model by using more powerful informatics approaches. Using deep neural networks, I obtained a ROC of 1 in the discovery dataset and 0.94 in the replication dataset. During the R00 phase, I plan to use the same approach on other neurodegenerative diseases to design specific predictive models. I will generate sequence data on the RNA present in longitudinal plasma samples of cases and controls from Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies to construct specific predictive models for each of them. Then I will replicate the models in preclinical samples of these diseases. Combining the information on all neurodegenerative diseases will also allow me to refine the predictive model and perform integrative analyses to describe mechanistic insights. My ultimate goal is to be able to use the predictive models as diagnostic tools, and if possible, as early diagnostic tests. The preliminary data is encouraging and opens the possibility of having plasma-based tests for neurodegeneration. Project Narrative This proposal will use transcriptomic data from plasma to model a predictive tool for Alzheimer Disease using bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. This is an innovative approach, a cost-effective and minimally invasive biomarker for Alzheimer Disease, which is critical for early detection (preclinical), diagnosis, disease intervention and monitoring. If successful, the results will lead to a breakthrough in the field.",Plasma Cell-Free RNA as Non-invasive Biomarker for Neurodegeneration,9891490,K99AG062723,"['African American', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Fetal Development', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Reagent', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Specificity', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'abeta deposition', 'accurate diagnosis', 'alpha synuclein', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'blood-based biomarker', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic screening', 'digital', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder control', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'minimally invasive', 'mutation carrier', 'nano-string', 'neuropathology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prenatal testing', 'presenilin-1', 'presenilin-2', 'prognostic tool', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,124680,0.11227534016139495
"Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease The objective of the proposed Fast-Track SBIR effort is to develop and commercialize the Ryan CompanionBot (hereafter, Ryan), an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementia (ADRD). According to the NIA, research reports estimate that as many as 5.1 million Americans may have AD, and the number is expected to rise as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. Ryan will be designed to promote social interaction and foster engagement and rapport, and improve mood and well-being of persons with early stage AD/ADRD. In the Phase I effort, we will develop facial emotion recognition technology and integrate it with Ryan and then conduct a pilot study to understand the feasiblity and effectiveness of Ryan in fostering empathy and rapport in interaction with persons with AD/ADRD. Once validated, we will work with domain experts to design and build aestehcically pleasing Ryan V2.0 and integrate the facial expression recognition technology with a spoken- dialog system, reminders, and other intelligent features into Ryan to address the needs of persons with early stage AD/ADRD and their caregivers. If successful, DreamFace will be positioned to bring to market an affordable and effective socially-assistive robot to improve the quality of life for persons with AD/ADRD. The goal of the project is to develop a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease,9984218,R44AG059483,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Computer software', 'Cost of Illness', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Esthetics', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Face', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Measures', 'Memory Loss', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Saints', 'Serotonin', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Well in self', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'common symptom', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'geriatric depression', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'mental state', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'repetitive behavior', 'robot assistance', 'satisfaction', 'social assistive robot', 'success', 'tau-1', 'tool']",NIA,"DREAM FACE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2020,767891,0.23315783450942718
"Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center 1. SUMMARY (Overall) The National Alzheimer's Project Act establishes an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease (AD); develop treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse the course of AD; improve the early diagnosis of AD; and decrease disparities in AD for ethnic and racial minority populations at higher risk for AD. In this context, AD is intended to encompass AD-related dementias, including dementia with Lewy bodies. In support of the goals and research milestones of the National Alzheimer's Project Act, the mission of the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) is to serve as a shared resource to facilitate and enhance research on AD and the spectrum of cognitive impairment associated with Lewy body (LB) pathology. We follow a strategy of deep phenotyping, believing that critical answers emerge more readily when investigators are able to delve deeply within and across multiple levels of participant data. Healthy adults without cognitive or motor impairment serve both as a comparison (control) population and as a preclinical population in which mechanisms of cognitive aging and clinical transition can be studied. People with Parkinson's disease without cognitive impairment also serve as comparators and as an at-risk transitional population for the development of cognitive impairment linked to LB pathology. ADRC resources will provide investigators with unique opportunities for the parallel study of these two neurodegenerative disorders, enabling insights into pathogenesis, preclinical diagnosis, transitions, resistance and resilience, and therapeutic approaches. Aims of the Stanford ADRC are to (1) provide an administrative structure that advances the mission of the center; (2) develop and maintain human resources for studies of the AD spectrum and the LB spectrum of cognitive impairment, as well as cognitive aging; (3) make available well-characterized brain tissues, brain-derived biospecimens, and quantitative molecular data derived from high-content imaging of brain tissues; (4) make available participant biospecimens and high-content biospecimen data; (5) provide structural, functional, and molecular neuroimaging biomarkers in support of research on AD-spectrum cognitive impairment, LB-spectrum cognitive impairment, and cognitive aging; (6) provide for the management of Stanford ADRC data, prepare research datasets, provide high-level biostatistical consultation for ADRC investigators, and support research on big data using tools from biostatistics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence; (7) with our community partners, provide respectful, culturally sensitive outreach and provide opportunities for education, training, and research participation for healthy adults, people with AD-spectrum and LB-spectrum disorders, and their families. Stanford ADRC outreach and community engagement extends particularly to urban Hispanic/Latino older adults, an important Bay Area population, which is under-represented in AD-related research; and (8) support the training of investigators and future leaders in the field of AD and related dementia.

"Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. While research efforts continue to focus on the causes of AD and to develop effective medical treatments, there is also a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. There may be subtle changes in brain and cognitive function that are detectable before major symptoms emerge. One approach for characterizing these vulnerabilities is the use of functional and structural neuroimaging to identify risk profiles for AD. The present study proposes and tests a model of AD pathology using neuroimaging network analysis and machine learning approaches to provide insight on widespread changes in information processing in the AD brain. The proposed model hypothesizes that some aspects of network information processing reflect neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD pathology (e.g., hub connectivity and global connectivity) whereas other network properties reflect attempts to compensate for compromised information processing (e.g., diffusion of information). In addition, this proposal compares the efficacy of models with respect to discriminating diagnostic categories (e.g., machine learning classification of AD and clinically normal subjects) versus isolating underlying dimensions of AD cognitive decline (e.g., machine learning prediction of memory and language scores from network features). Finally, this study will determine whether features of AD pathology are present in an at-risk sample of subjects; namely, individuals diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This will be examined by transferring the AD network models to aMCI subjects and testing whether the model can discriminate aMCI from clinically normal matched controls and whether the model can predict scores on cognitive tests. The analytic approach will using resting state fMRI data as a primary assay of network integrity, but diffusion imaging and task fMRI data will also be examined in an exploratory aim. The general approach will recruit individuals with AD, aMCI and clinically normal matched controls for each diagnostic group. The groups that are compared directly will be matched for amyloid status, as indicated by florbetapir PET imaging. The novel contributions of this project include (a) testing a network model of AD pathology that unifies various measures of network functioning, (b) comparing efficacy of modeling with respect to delineating diagnostic categories versus capturing underlying cognitive dimensions of AD, and (c) transferring the AD model to an at-risk group to assess disease vulnerability. This latter innovation can be applied in future studies to any group of subjects that is defined at risk, such as those with genetic vulnerability or positive family history. The present study also sets the stage for a subsequent longitudinal follow-up study to validate whether individuals identified at risk using network modeling actually convert to AD. Ultimately, network modeling of this sort may be used as a relatively less expensive and less invasive biomarker than PET imaging, which could lead to earlier treatments and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years, there is a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. The present study will use neuroimaging to examine brain connectivity and determine whether some aspects of altered connectivity are present in individuals who are at risk for AD: individuals who have mild cognitive impairment. This approach could be used in the future to possibly detect risk for AD before any cognitive symptoms emerge, thereby enabling earlier treatment and intervention to combat the devastating cognitive, social and financial consequences of AD.",Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease,9963079,R01AG055132,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Financial compensation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Center for Health Statistics', 'Well in self', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'combat', 'comparative efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'response', 'social']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,745812,0.2600295958559278
"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias that are associated with major adverse effects on daily function and quality of life, and accelerate time to institutionalization. Of all the NPS, depression is the most frequently observed symptom in people with mild cognitive impairment and early AD. As the disease progresses, agitation, delusions and hallucinations become more common, whereas apathy is the most persistent and frequent NPS throughout all the stages of AD. AD-NPS share some clinical features with serious mental illnesses (SMIs), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but whether these conditions share similar aethiopathies is unclear. Given that reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias do not exist, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses is a critical next step to identify reliable biomarkers that could lead to novel therapeutics.  There are two overarching goals of this proposal. First, we will identify the molecular mechanisms and neuropathological changes that are associated with the presence of NPS in patients with AD. Second, we will examine if the mechanisms of pathology associated with NPS are shared or distinct among AD and SMIs. More specifically, we propose to build multi-scale integrative models using phenomics and genomics data from 1,264 autopsy cases derived from a single brain bank. The bank includes detailed phenomics data such as well characterized NPS, clinical diagnosis (AD and other neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric traits), severity of cognitive decline and neuropathology for each patient sample. From each case, we will apply innovative approaches that reduce the cost and technical biases associated with conventional methods, and capture gene expression signatures and epigenetic regulatory elements at the single-cell level. Novel deep-learning methods will be applied for the multi-scale integration of neuropathologic changes with genetic markers and functional genomic changes (such as changes in gene expression and enhancer sequences) within specific cell types, to predict various NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric traits; we refer to these integrative models as genotype- marker-phenotype models. We expect that these models will enable us to assign genotypes and molecular markers to specific NPS within AD and other neuropsychiatric traits at the single-cell level, an unprecedented level of resolution. In addition, we will test the translational potential of the genotype-marker-phenotype models to predict AD-NPS using independent large-scale biobank datasets, in which genotypes and electronic health records are available. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have immediate utility by generating potential biomarkers for NPS diagnosis and prognosis and by providing predictive models for patient stratification in clinical trials. In the longer term, our models will help us create a blueprint for therapeutic strategies and interventions to treat NPS in AD. PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, that contributes to early institutionalization and causes substantial caregiving and caregiver burden. Despite decades of research, reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias have not been found. The proposed studies will generate and integrate high-dimensional phenomics and genomics data in human brain tissue, that will inform us about the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in the context of AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses.",Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease,10020905,R01AG067025,"['Adverse effects', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epitopes', 'Factor Analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutionalization', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Quality of life', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'brain tissue', 'care giving burden', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular marker', 'neuropathology', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'severe mental illness', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,1875015,0.2694808033447172
"The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD The goal of this ongoing R01 is to chart the progression of pathobiologic markers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their effect on neural function and cognition in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with risk for AD. There is an appreciable gap in knowledge about the temporal disease course in this age range that this ongoing project has been directly addressing with serial multimodal imaging including amyloid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, and serial cognitive measurement. In the next funding cycle we will add a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique sensitive to fibrillar tau [F-18]THK5351 indexing neurofibrillary pathology. In the prior funding period we recruited 179 individuals from a registry of 1,545 people at risk for AD known as WRAP (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention). We found that [C-11]PIB amyloid burden is detectable in 20% of people with parental history of AD at a mean age of 60. Baseline amyloid is more extensive in the presence of higher CSF total tau levels, and 2-year increases in PiB amyloid are significantly predicted by higher baseline CSF tau. The hypothesis for this renewal is that tau- related neurofibrillar pathology begins early (in accord with the neuropathology literature) in people at AD risk and its strategic spatial burden explains changes in amyloid, neural function and cognitive decline. Aim 1: To test the premise that amyloid burden is necessary but not sufficient to evoke preclinical cognitive change. We will examine effects of longitudinal amyloid and tau change on episodic memory trajectories over time in 235 at risk individuals including all subjects we previously enrolled and follow them over 2 years with advanced multimodal imaging and CSF. Aim 2: To assess the effects of tau and amyloid imaging on MRI and CSF indicators of neural injury and function. Aim 3: To develop a multimodal disease marker to maximize efficiency of clinical trials in preclinical AD. Following our work in creating tools for efficient clinical trials in MCI, we will extend these concepts to the pre-MCI phase of disease utilizing deep learning architectures with tau, amyloid and structural imaging inputs. We will also examine change over time in tau, amyloid and cognition as outcomes. As any of these features considered singularly may be affected by age, and as amyloid and tau may be `necessary but not sufficient' by themselves, a derived multimodal marker may have eventual clinical utility in enriching prevention trials with those most likely to progress, and increasing power to detect change attributable to preclinical interventions. Significance: Relative tau and amyloid imaging profiles have not been empirically established in the presymptomatic time frame and this information is urgently needed to identify incipient disease. No comparable studies exist regarding the evolution of tau and amyloid signal in the critical late-middle-age time frame of preclinical AD. This ongoing project represents a unique opportunity to examine the earliest determinants of AD progression, when treatments may be most meaningful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/ NARRATIVE Identifying the earliest neuropathological features of AD including tau and amyloid pathology will improve early detection and inform clinical trials in the presymptomatic time frame. This project will examine these features with advanced imaging methods in a cohort at risk for AD who are largely asymptomatic. An outgrowth of the project will be information about the rate of change in AD pathology which can help us plan clinical trials in this population using derived outcomes about the brain itself, thereby reducing the number of subjects needed in a trial and increasing sensitivity to detecting change.",The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD,9919506,R01AG021155,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Memory Loss', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention trial', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Secondary to', 'Semantic memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'amyloid pathology', 'amyloid structure', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'entorhinal cortex', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nerve injury', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'white matter', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,1802518,0.2175878964403022
"Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology. Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple health threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, efforts in drug discovery and repurposing for the treatment of AD have had limited success. The failure is largely attributed to the adoption of a reductionist model of “one-drug-one-gene- one-disease”. As AD is a multi-facet complex disease, a new treatment approach is urgently needed to simultaneously target multiple pathological processes responsible for the onset and progress of AD, some of which are also common to other diseases that cause dementia. In this application, we will develop an innovative translational bioinformatics approach to addressing challenges in AD drug discovery. Our approach is based on a new paradigm of systems pharmacology, which focuses on defining multiple targets to a single drug or a drug combination, and studying the effect of the drug(s) on perturbing disease-causing networks. Over the last ten years, we have developed a novel structural systems pharmacology (SSP) platform that can predict genome-wide high-resolution protein-chemical interactions and correlate molecular interactions with phenotype responses. The SSP platform synergistically combines novel methods from machine learning, bioinformatics, biophysics, and systems biology. We have successfully applied the SSP platform to drug repurposing, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, precision medicine, and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, and in close collaborations with experimental laboratories, we will develop, and rigorously test a novel SSP approach to AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology. Firstly, we will develop a drug-gene-disease multi-layered network model (MULAN) that links FDA-approved drugs with neurodegenerative diseases through protein-chemical interactions, gene- disease associations, and chemical-disease associations through integrating multiple omics data. Secondly, we will improve and apply our proven successful SSP platform, which can accurately infer novel relations from sparse and noisy MULAN, to identify safe FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed for AD treatment. Finally, we will experimentally test FDA-approved drugs identified for their binding activity of drug targets and anti-AD potency in cell and animal models. The successful completion of this project will provide an integrated computational modeling framework for AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology as well as identify novel targeted anti-AD therapeutics toward pre-clinical trials. Relevance Statement Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, AD is a complex disease that has been extremely hard to treat with the conventional approach. New methods that can reuse old drugs to target mulple pathological processes in AD may provide new solutions to effective AD treatment.",Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology.,9949584,R01AG057555,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biophysics', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diazoxide', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Human', 'Inflammation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'clinical application', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical development', 'preclinical trial', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic candidate', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2020,779392,0.17494336494087726
"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens. Feasibility rests with prior studies on evolution, networks, systems, and text-mining that demonstrate accurate predictions of deleterious mutations and their clinical sequelae and the discovery of drivers of diseases. Broadly, this work will yield proof of principle for a novel quantitative model that integrates fundamental concepts from mathematics and molecular evolution, and for a low resolution but large-scale map of biomedical knowledge in which network notions of distance computed by machine learning identify relevant functional hypothesis that would otherwise be easily overlooked. The result will be a new experimental ability to unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship in Alzheimer's Disease so as to guide drug therapy. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease projected to rise dramatically in our aging population. To develop drugs against it, we propose to train machine learning on the DNA of patients with Alzheimer's to detect genes with abnormal mathematical features in their mutations. Then, we will place these genes in a “map”, which represents a large fraction of biomedical knowledge in a high-dimensional network. The drugs that fall near our genes of interest in this map are our candidates, and experiments will test in cell and mouse models whether they affect the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's.",A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs,9975673,R01AG061105,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Animal Model', 'Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Behavior', 'Calculi', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Production', 'PubMed', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'database structure', 'disorder risk', 'drug testing', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interest', 'molecular modeling', 'mouse model', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision drugs', 'protective factors', 'screening', 'stem', 'structured data', 'success', 'synergism', 'tau Proteins', 'text searching', 'unstructured data', 'virtual']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,792498,0.0927567374263761
"Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Effectual solutions will come only from innovative research. While aging is the biggest risk factor for developing AD, it is unclear to what extent normal aging is distinct from AD and which age-related factors drive disease. Senescence is a homeostatic response, which aims to prevent the propagation of these damaged cells while they remain viable and metabolically active. Senescent-like phenotypes have been described in neurons despite neurons being post-mitotic cells and these cells may release factors that trigger senescence in surrounding glia. Senescent glia and senescent-like neurons increase in the brain with age and are thought to contribute to the loss of function associated with aging and age-related diseases like AD. Our application, entitled “Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease,” is highly responsive to the objectives outlined in the RFA-AG-20-025, by leveraging an innovative molecular imaging platform we invented at Stanford; multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), in order to uncouple age- from cognitive decline-related cellular senescence. MIBI enables us to quantify, with low nanometer resolution, high-dimensional, protein-level expression patterns, single-cell (neuro/immune) interactions, and spatial localization of senescence- and AD- relevant molecules (Aim 1) in a model of healthy aging (Aim 2) and well-characterized cases of AD related cognitive impairment (Aim 3). Importantly, MIBI allows all of this to be accomplished in archival FFPE material, thus allowing retrospective analysis on a variety of existing cohorts. By creating in-depth, phenotypic cellular signatures with spatial context from our unique aging and cognitive cohorts, we will be able to provide insight for modifiable factors promoting cognitive decline by filtering those specifically associated with aging alone. In this research program, collaborative expertise in clinical neuropathology and cognitive decline, technological advancements in imaging, biochemical/molecular and cellular biology, and machine learning analytics converge in this proposed research program to address the spatio-cellular (neuro/immune, senescent) heterogeneity in non-human primate (NHP) and human models of healthy aging and AD brains. Furthermore, it will be synergistic to, and draw on expertise developed in existing infrastructure to image and organize AD clinical pathology (R01AG056287, R01AG057915, MPIs: SC Bendall, RM Angelo, TJ Montine) as well as the NIA-funded 90+ UCI cohort, control material housed in the Stanford ADRC, and NHP specimens (P50 AG047366 co-I: TJ Montine). We will reveal cellular senescent phenotypes that differentiate AD from normal age-associated senescence. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. By using multi- parametric measurements with enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) we will be able to uncouple unhealthy brain senescence, that could be therapeutically targeted, from that associated with the normal aging process.",Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease,10043941,R01AG068279,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African Green Monkey', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cell Aging', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dendrites', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inferior', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Microglia', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Parietal', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Validation', 'abeta accumulation', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'brain tissue', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'collaborative approach', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'entorhinal cortex', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mind control', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'nanometer resolution', 'nanoscale', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuropathology', 'nonhuman primate', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'release factor', 'response', 'senescence', 'shared database', 'stressor', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic target', 'vervet']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,394250,0.12600162705923415
"Towards a better understanding of genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease with human iPSC models PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia with high heritability (~70%). It is increasingly clear that AD is highly polygenic, and for most of AD cases it is the polygenicity of the risk variants across the genome that predisposes the disease risk. In contrast to the rapid identification of risk loci associated with AD by recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), identifying the potential causal variants/genes at the reported risk loci and decoding these variants/genes into molecular and cellular pathology have lagged far behind. Since disease variants, mostly locating in noncoding regions of the human genome, have been shown to affect cellular function through multi-level regulations such as DNA accessibility and histone modifications, DNA methylation and RNA expression in a cell type-specific manner, comprehensive and unbiased investigating the cell type-specific influence of generic risk variants on AD risk at multiple levels, including epigenomic, transcriptomic, and cellular levels, in an isogenic background is crucial to understand the genetic basis of AD pathogenesis. In the current application, by combining human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with gene editing and comprehensive multi-omics and cellular analyses, we will dissect the AD genetic risk variants into cell type-specific molecular and cellular pathology. Given the polygenic nature of AD, and the heterogeneity of AD risk genes on the cellular level, we hypothesize that multiple genetic risk variants act synergistically among different compartments (e.g. cell types) to contribute to pathogenesis of AD. First, we will identify AD risk variants and genes with comprehensive analyses of AD genetic architecture using machine learning approaches including DVAR, eVAR and iRIGS (Aim 1). Second, we will delineate the cell type-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures associated with AD candidate risk variants using human iPSC-derived neurons/microglia/astrocytes (Aim 2). Last, we will determine the functional impact of AD candidate risk variants on AD-like cellular pathology in neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and their co-cultures (Aim 3). Our proposal may advance our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of AD, leading to a better understanding of AD pathogenesis and facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia with high heritability. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AD have identified more than 20 risk loci, the genetic etiology of AD leading to molecular and cellular pathology remains largely unknown. By combining human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with gene editing and comprehensive multi-omics and cellular analyses, our investigation will reveal the cell type-specific effects of AD genetic risk variants on AD pathogenesis, which may advance our understanding of genetic architecture of AD and disease etiology, and lead to therapeutic advances.",Towards a better understanding of genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease with human iPSC models,10052141,R01AG065611,"['ATAC-seq', 'Abeta synthesis', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer like pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cell Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Conformation Capture and Sequencing', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium Mapping', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain tissue', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'cellular pathology', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'molecular pathology', 'multiple omics', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel therapeutics', 'risk variant', 'synaptic function', 'tau aggregation', 'tau phosphorylation', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,787568,0.2017744138355571
"Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate is an epileptologist and neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, whose long-term career goal is to become an independent- ly funded translational investigator with expertise at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive co-morbidities. The ability to translate the clinical experience, research tools, and intellectual framework from the field of epilepsy to that of the neurodegenerative diseases, and vice versa, could be a powerful approach to studying both processes. During the proposed training period, the candidate will combine her prior training in epilepsy, EEG signal processing, and machine learning, with newly acquired skills in neuroimaging (functional MRI), biostatistics, and additional clinical exposure to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Cash, an expert in epilepsy and neurophysiologic signal processing, and the co-mentorship of Dr. Reisa Sperling, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuroimaging approaches, the candidate proposes to: 1) Delineate the spectrum of epileptiform activity in early stages of AD and develop computa- tional tools to identify this activity; 2) Establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie epileptiform activity in AD; and 3) Determine how epileptiform abnormalities are associated with cognitive trajectories in patients with early stage AD. Visual and computational analysis of 24- hour scalp EEGs will be integrated with resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements, amy- loid PET imaging, and longitudinal cognitive testing from subjects with AD, to develop a com- prehensive understanding of the role of epileptiform abnormalities in early stages of AD. In addi- tion to the research proposed, the candidate’s career development plan entails rigorous coursework and seminars, practical hands-on experience, and close guidance from a board of academic advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow the candidate to establish a clinical and research niche at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases, and to develop a comprehensive toolbox with which to probe human brain function from the standpoint of neurophysiology, structure, connectivity, and tar- geted pathology. Collectively, these will form the foundation for a successful career as an inde- pendent investigator pursuing important clinical and translational research projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, or both. Project Narrative People with Alzheimer’s disease are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and people with epilepsy commonly suffer from impairments in memory and cognition. Our goals are to better understand the interplay between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and to determine whether epileptiform activity may be a treatable contributor to cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. This has important public health implications, as according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a treatment that slows the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s disease by five-fold would reduce the number of people with severe Alzheimer’s disease from 6.5 million to 1.2 million and reduce Medicare costs by 50% by the year 2050.",Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease,9897545,K23NS101037,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Technical Expertise', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,200880,0.15163632965214582
"PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in adults over the age of 65, and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the leading cause of dementia in middle age, with the behavioral variant subtype (bvFTD) being the most prevalent form. The relationships between clinical syndromes and pathological causes are complex, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult. For example, multiple studies have indicated that a significant proportion of cases of AD-like dementia show evidence of non-AD pathology, such as inclusions of the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein associated with clinical FTD. Also, AD neuropathology has been found in 15–30% of patient with the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers will be needed, so that they can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient populations. In this project, we will focus on clinically diagnosed bvFTD and AD patients, and apply machine learning to multimodal neuroimaging (T1, FDG-PET) data pooled from large, multisite studies of AD and FTD. Our goal is to develop novel biomarkers that can differentiate bvFTD, AD and controls. Our hypothesis is that each neuropathology is associated with a distinct biomarker signature, and these signatures can be discovered through well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical profiles. We will use available amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of β-amyloid and tau to assess the robustness of our predictions of AD neuropathologies. In Aim 1 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal structural imaging to develop predictive biomarker models for differentiating bvFTD vs. AD. In Aim 2 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal FDG-PET imaging to develop predictive biomarker models. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the combination of structural and FDG-PET imaging as predictive biomarker models.  Relevance: This research supports NIH initiatives on long-term, personalized precision medicine and big data science. Our predictive biomarker models can inform participant selection in clinical trials so that we can identify disease-modifying treatments with greater power. Our system-biology approach can enable us to generate new questions on mechanisms underlying the origin and progression of neuro-pathological processes, create new data and computational tools that can in turn generate new insights and new hypotheses. NARRATIVE  Accurate diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is difficult because the relationships between clinical syndromes, and pathological and genetic causes are complex.

"PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in adults over the age of 65, and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the leading cause of dementia in middle age, with the behavioral variant subtype (bvFTD) being the most prevalent form. The relationships between clinical syndromes and pathological causes are complex, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult. For example, multiple studies have indicated that a significant proportion of cases of AD-like dementia show evidence of non-AD pathology, such as inclusions of the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein associated with clinical FTD. Also, AD neuropathology has been found in 15–30% of patient with the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers will be needed, so that they can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient populations. In this project, we will focus on clinically diagnosed bvFTD and AD patients, and apply machine learning to multimodal neuroimaging (T1, FDG-PET) data pooled from large, multisite studies of AD and FTD. Our goal is to develop novel biomarkers that can differentiate bvFTD, AD and controls. Our hypothesis is that each neuropathology is associated with a distinct biomarker signature, and these signatures can be discovered through well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical profiles. We will use available amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of β-amyloid and tau to assess the robustness of our predictions of AD neuropathologies. In Aim 1 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal structural imaging to develop predictive biomarker models for differentiating bvFTD vs. AD. In Aim 2 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal FDG-PET imaging to develop predictive biomarker models. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the combination of structural and FDG-PET imaging as predictive biomarker models.  Relevance: This research supports NIH initiatives on long-term, personalized precision medicine and big data science. Our predictive biomarker models can inform participant selection in clinical trials so that we can identify disease-modifying treatments with greater power. Our system-biology approach can enable us to generate new questions on mechanisms underlying the origin and progression of neuro-pathological processes, create new data and computational tools that can in turn generate new insights and new hypotheses. NARRATIVE  Accurate diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is difficult because the relationships between clinical syndromes, and pathological and genetic causes are complex. In this project, we propose to use machine learning technologies to develop powerful predictive biomarkers that can distinguish bvFTD, AD and healthy controls, using well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical data from multiple national databases.

"The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Genomic studies for late-onset AD (LOAD) have identified over 20 risk loci; however, translating the relevant molecules identified by genomics to AD-specific mechanistic pathways has been challenging. Our application, entitled “The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline Revealed by Next- Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,” is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing a uniquely innovative molecular imaging platform called multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) that will determine high dimensional protein interactions for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomics studies in normal and pathological states. Our proposal has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze four regions in healthy aged brains: two sectors of the hippocampal pyramidal layer and from two isocortical regions. Next- generation MIBI instrumentation will be used to image simultaneously 30+ proteins that mark subtypes of neurons, synapses, and non-neuronal cells, while covering regulatory signaling, neuro-inflammatory components, and AD risk gene protein products with subcellular resolution. In Aim 2, we propose to use the same multiplexed imaging methods in AD brain stratified by APOE genotype. We will analyze these data with statistical machine learning methods already established in our laboratory, similar to what we have done previously with different cancers and the immune system. In Aim 3, using infrastructure we have already have established, we will create a web-based portal where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi- color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features we derive shared freely. We propose a transformative, collaborative approach to AD that leverages a long-standing NIA-funded longitudinal cohort and is highly responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan. These novel insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets and will create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD. Project Narrative AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate a phenotypic landscape of cognitive decline, to understand modulation of cognitive decline during compensation and relate genetic predisposition to changes in phenotypic landscape defined by muti-parametric measurements using enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI).  ",The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,9910356,R01AG056287,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Electrons', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Middle frontal gyrus structure', 'Molecular', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'burden of illness', 'collaborative approach', 'computational pipelines', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'disability', 'gene product', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning method', 'mental state', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'symposium', 'web portal']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,514173,0.2274197174991437
"US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although dementia has a global impact, efforts to address ensuing challenges have come mostly from high- income countries (HICs). Whereas the prevalence and incidence of dementia appear to be stable or declining in such countries, an alarmingly opposite tendency typifies South American countries (SAC). This scenario proves even more challenging due to region-specific traits. First, the particular genetic and environmental backgrounds of SAC limit the generalizability of key findings from HICs. Moreover, the greater genetic diversity and impact of socioeconomic status (SES) of SAC remain markedly understudied. Of note, this is true of the four largest SAC (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), representing over 75% of the region’s population. In addition, SAC face a dearth of innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional studies on two of their most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is thus critical for SAC to join ongoing international efforts and develop a gold-standard approach for detecting disease-specific alterations in a context of methodological, genetic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity. Against this background, our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD presentation in SAC relative to the US. To this end, we will establish a cohort to test large samples from the four abovementioned SAC, as well as the US (totaling > 3000 participants, including 1500 controls, 750 AD patients, and 750 FTD patients). We will combine standardized clinical assessments with innovative analytical techniques including multimodal machine learning to account for heterogeneity in these diverse populations. By combining standardized genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (SES-cognitive) measures, we will test the underlying hypothesis that there are unique risk factors for AD and FTD in SAC which do not prove significant in US populations. More particularly, we will aim to (a) establish genetic risk to AD and FTD in diverse SAC cohorts; (b) test whether patients from SAC and the US can be discriminated after accounting for how SES affects cognitive and brain imaging signatures; and (c) determine genetic, cognitive, cerebral, and socioeconomic factors that discriminate among SAC vs. US patients. Positive impacts of this work include a better understanding of the genetic and socioeconomic factors driving neurocognitive manifestations of dementia, and the identification of novel genetic targets for risk reduction and disease prevention in SAC. Our large multimodal, cross-sectional study will enable clinical assessment of understudied patient groups, extend and harmonize existing data sets, and prompt the development of novel measures and multimodal machine learning protocols. More generally, by establishing a collaborative framework which capitalizes on unique regional populations, our proposal can consolidate a SAC-based platform for future translational research and assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although the prevalence and incidence of dementia appears to be stable or declining in high-income countries, South American countries (SAC) face the opposite scenario, with increased dementia prevalence, probably triggered by a combination of genetic and socioeconomic status (SES) factors. This proposal aims to create the first SAC-based multicenter initiative to study dementia, by combining genomic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (cognitive, clinical, socioeconomic) data. This project constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to foster regional synergy and multilevel research towards the harmonization of global strategies to fight dementia in SAC.",US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research,10219627,R01AG057234,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Argentina', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Brain imaging', 'Brazil', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Colombia', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Education', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Status', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Indigenous', 'International', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South American', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'disorder prevention', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fighting', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lipid metabolism', 'low socioeconomic status', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'synergism', 'trait']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,807005,0.08782615449879627
"Cognitive Heterogeneity in those with high Alzheimer's Disease Risk The lack of an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to a call to detect the disease earlier in its course but AD's insidious onset that can span many years, adds complexity to doing so. As a result, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has identified to understand the heterogeneity of AD, particularly at the asymptomatic stages as a research priority. While there are well-documented high AD risk factors (e.g., age, apolipoprotein E4, cardiovascular risk, amyloid and tau pathology), diagnosis is not inevitable, but it remains unknown why only some of those with high AD risk progress to disease and others do not. We contend that one challenge for answering this question is that by the time traditional AD preclinical symptoms of memory decline and/or hippocampal atrophy emerge, the neurodegenerative trajectory is already on a near irreversible course. We further hypothesize that traditional measurement methods produce crude measures that mask the broader range of clinical expression in the preclinical period and preclude the earliest opportunity to detect the beginning of the neurodegenerative trajectory. In this updated application, we seek to leverage the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cognitive aging and dementia database, acquired through nearly 7 decades of prospective examination. Unique to FHS since 2005 has been the collection of novel NP indices (error responses, digital metrics such as item-level latencies, fragmented responses). Baseline data were collected at a time when the vast majority of these participants appeared asymptomatic, including those who are at high AD risk, a subset of which have since progressed to incident AD as well as similarly high AD risk subgroups who did not. Through a one year R56, we provide new preliminary data in support of our aims to 1) characterize the cognitive heterogeneity of these high AD risk groups as they do and do not progress to disease, 2) determine whether traditional neuroimaging biomarkers differentiate between progressors and non- progressors and 3) develop novel machine learning methods to identify neuroimaging indices even earlier than traditional MRI measures. We predict that with additional analyses we will identify unique cognitive profiles that better differentiate those at high AD risk who do and do not progress to AD, that the NP profiles of high AD risk progressors will be associated with AD neuroimaging markers (e.g. decline in total brain and hippocampal volume, increase in white matter hyperintensities) while the NP profiles of high AD risk non-progressors will not show similar evidence of brain structure changes. We will further build on our preliminary work of developing an adversarial learning framework to enhance baseline MRI images to serve as better predictors of high AD risk progressor and non-progressor groups than the original images. Results will lead to identification of a broader spectrum of preclinical presentation in those with high AD risk than has been previously recognized and thus better characterize the heterogeneity of NP performance, particularly earlier in the disease course, potentially identifying a critical period in which intervention strategies can mitigate disease risk. This study seeks to characterize the heterogeneity of cognitive profiles among those who are at high risk for Alzheimer's disease and differentiate those who do go on to disease and those who do not. This study is enhanced by novel cognitive data that include digital metrics, that permit more extensive characterization of unique cognitive profiles in these high-risk groups.",Cognitive Heterogeneity in those with high Alzheimer's Disease Risk,9975371,RF1AG062109,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Female', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Update', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'critical period', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'longitudinal database', 'machine learning method', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'virtual']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,RF1,2020,1532717,0.2335428440029014
"Developing mobile software that uses visual mapping techniques as habit-based assistive technology for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias and their caregivers Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) are age-associated neurodegenerative diseases that are reaching epidemic proportions. Progression of AD is characterized by losses in memory, orientation, independent decision-making capacity, and self-care. Gains in understanding AD pathogenesis have not yet translated into pharmacological therapies that effectively slow or halt disease progression. Evidence-based behavioral approaches are rapidly becoming recognized as methods to provide effective neurocognitive and therapeutic support for AD/ADRD patients and their caregivers1.  Behavioral approaches such as lifestyle changes and risk reduction are non-pharmacological therapies that are accessible, personalizable, have no side effects, and are low in cost. To that end, we are developing mobile device software that is patient and caregiver centered, and provides behavioral-based assistance through visual mapping. The MapHabitTM system (MHS) uses pictures and keywords to assist memory- impaired patients and caregivers in organizing and successfully accomplishing their activities of daily living. This approach is innovative through its unique recruitment of the brain’s habit learning system (neostriatum) rather than the hippocampal structures damaged in AD. Preliminary work revealed that commercially available visual mapping software is too complicated for memory-impaired and technology-naïve individuals to use effectively. Commercially available software is proprietary and cannot be modified to meet their needs.  In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we propose to further develop and enhance MHS by integrating three novel specific aims that involve (1) development of adaptive user interfaces which can be personalized and dynamically adjusted for cognitive status, allowing for a greater range of memory-impaired individuals to benefit from visual mapping; (2) linkage of personalized visual maps to smart devices, including wearables (e.g., Apple iWatch) and audio interfaces (e.g., Amazon Echo); (3) establishment of a predictive analytics tool that will accurately track and predict changes in functional status.  We are advantaged in this SBIR Phase 1 application by having access to patients and caregivers, including underrepresented minority populations, who are currently involved in our preliminary studies assessing the impact of visual mapping on quality of life measures. All of these individuals are already well- characterized in terms of their cognitive and emotional behavior, both before and after the use of visual mapping (see letters of support from Dr. E. Vaughn, Atlanta VA Health Care System, Dr. M. Parker, Emory University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and F. Boatman, RN, Speak Life Management). Those studies will contribute to the preliminary data section of our planned SBIR Phase 2 application that will: assess the effectiveness of MHS on a broad range of large clinical populations, improve the user-experience for memory-impaired individuals, and refine our methods of machine learning to predict healthcare outcomes. Impressive gains in our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have not created therapies that are safe and effective. We are developing the MapHabitTM system, an application for mobile devices that is safe, non- invasive, and low in cost, which helps memory-impaired individuals and caregivers accomplish activities and improve independent function. This is done by using a technique called visual mapping to utilize areas of the brain that are not damaged by AD.",Developing mobile software that uses visual mapping techniques as habit-based assistive technology for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias and their caregivers,9993188,R43AG065081,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Businesses', 'Bypass', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Epidemic', 'Feedback', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neostriatum', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonpharmacologic Therapy', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk Reduction', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Unconscious State', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'digital', 'emotional behavior', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional status', 'habit learning', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'smart watch', 'software development', 'success', 'visual map', 'wearable device']",NIA,"MAPHABIT, INC.",R43,2020,498557,0.09798310288094297

"Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the complexity of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis and the associated co-morbid conditions, both the “depth” and the “width” of currently available drug repurposing solutions need to be improved in order to deliver effective AD therapeutic solutions. The depth of a drug-repurposing project refers to the level of understanding of disease mechanism and drug-target interactions across a wide searching space for the combination of dosage and treatment time. Achieving depth requires a reliable AD model system that comprehensively recapitulates AD pathogenesis in a human brain-like environment, and sophisticated transcriptomic profiles, which can reveal molecular-level changes underlying disease-reversing phenotypes across multiple treatment conditions. The width of a therapy search relies on the efficacy of predicting and validating effects of candidate compounds from an enormous search space. Width can be achieved from novel computational algorithms connecting –omics changes with phenotypic changes, thus guiding the search with improved knowledge on mechanisms and avoiding exhaustive testing of every available drug. Integrating the systems medicine and drug repositioning expertise of the Wong Lab at the Houston Methodist Research Institute of Houston Methodist Hospital with the Alzheimer's biology expertise of the Kim and Tanzi labs at Massachusetts General Hospital, we propose a SysteMatic Alzheimer's disease drug ReposiTioning (SMART) framework based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening. Reformatting a novel three- dimensional human neural stem cell culture model of AD (a.k.a. Alzheimer's in a dish) developed in the Kim and Tanzi labs for high content screening, the Wong lab screened 2,640 known drugs and bioactive compounds and obtained a panel of 38 primary hits that strongly inhibit β-amyloid-driven p-tau accumulation. We hypothesize that iteratively running relatively small screens with our novel 3D cell model and applying systematic artificial intelligence modeling to the transcriptomic profiles of the screening hits will allow us to: 1) quickly obtain a panel of robust novel drug candidates for AD, and 2) gain an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms from those repositioned drug candidates, which will subsequently improve the success rate of predicting novel hits. Using the primary 38 hits as a starting point, the SMART computational modules will update the existing NeuriteIQ software package to quantify the image data from high content screening; it will also incorporate publicly available big data transcriptomic profiles to predict candidate compounds inducing similar pathway changes as those original compounds, effectively expanding the search width to tens of thousands of compounds while only requiring functional validation of less than 100 drug candidates. The validated predictions will, in turn, add to the panel of known hits that will launch the next round of computational predictions and experimental validations, efficiently generating candidates for novel AD therapies (Aim 1). SMART's iterative prediction-validation scheme effectively connects more transcriptomic profiles to desirable phenotypic changes. Thus, we will apply systematic image-omics modeling to uncover novel mechanisms driving such phenotypes. For all the validated hits, dose-responses for the phenotype of pTau inhibition will be obtained using the 3D culture model; while the dose-responses for individual genes and pathways will be modeled through public and in-house generated transcriptomic profiles. We will use Partial Least Square Regression models to identify gene modules with matching dose-response curves as the phenotypes, thus allowing us to go beyond the confinement of canonical pathway maps and identify novel functional modules specifically related to phenotypes of interest (Aim 2). Selected compounds derived from the previous two aims will be evaluated in human neurons directly derived from AD patients and in animal models (Aim 3). Success of this work will lead to new AD therapeutic compounds ready for translation into clinical trials, as well as a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the SMART framework for drug repositioning will be generalizable to other big data and disease platforms. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) currently afflicts 5.3 million people in the United States alone. Beyond symptomatic treatments, no clear therapeutic options are available. The proposed study provides a systematic drug repositioning strategy that uses a novel 3D human neural culture model (Alzheimer's-in-a-dish) integrated with a computational platform that leverages publicly available toxicology and pharmokinetic big data. Success of the study will greatly reduce the cost of AD drug development, identify potential new disease mechanism, and facilitate quicker translation from bench to bedside. .",Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics,9949589,R01AG057635,"['3-Dimensional', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Methodist Church', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Institute', 'Running', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Width', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'comorbidity', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'exhaustion', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'individual response', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symptom treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tau-1', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,713868,0.13085335160728429
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9995038,UH3NS100599,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Microscopic', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sclerosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'White Matter Disease', 'age related', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo evaluation', 'in vivo imaging', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'pathology imaging', 'protective factors', 'religious order study', 'tissue injury', 'treatment response', 'vascular risk factor']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH3,2020,1159758,0.09357514952780385
"Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease Abstract The exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes derived from brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by powerful computational tools has the potential of developing new knowledge, including the identification of pathways and targets that may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of the disease. The challenge is to find drugs that impact those pathways, and then validate the importance of those pathways – distinguishing primary disease drivers from secondary events. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to probe potential pathways in proof of concept, and ultimately therapeutic, clinical trials. Here, we propose to discover and validate hypotheses for drug repurposing in AD through three integrated, complementary informatics approaches. Specifically, we will apply classical and network aware (prior-loaded) machine learning approaches to identify pathways and targets altered in AD brains at different stages of disease progression using data from Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD available through Synapse (Aim 1); we will use systems pharmacology approaches to discover the target selectivity of lead compounds in human neuronal and glial cell types using unbiased RNA-seq, proteomic and imaging studies followed by pathway analysis (Aim 2). Each of these two Aims has two approaches: data-driven, hypothesis-generating analyses to discern disease-relevant drug signals; and hypothesis-testing in which positive findings from one approach are evaluated using the other approaches to assess rigor and reproducibility. Moreover, RNA-seq and proteomic data collected in cultured human CNS cell types following exposure to potential disease drivers and/or FDA-approved drugs in Aim 2 will be fed back into Aim 1 as CNS-cell type-derived priors to refine the predictive models. In Aim 3, we will develop new informatics strategies to conduct in-silico drug trials in EHR data with “prospective” outcomes to validate hypotheses based on the omics data sets and extant literature, using two big data sets: the UK 20 year CPRD longitudinal records of 20M National Health Service patients, and the RPDR Database (based at Partners Healthcare) with 6 M individuals followed for over 20 years. This integrated informatics program compensates for the limitations of each individual informatics approach to promote discovery and critical evaluation of “lead compounds” for known and novel AD pathways. To execute this strategy, we have assembled a multi-site, multi-disciplinary team with expertise ranging from clinical care to computer science and systems pharmacology. Some of the team members are AD experts and others bring an outsider's perspective. Finally, as a deliverable, we will create open-source data packages to release all the supporting evidence, software, and data with provenance in accordance with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) standards through Synapse and the AlzDataLens platform developed at MGH (Aim 4). These data packages will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies including collaborations with industry or members of the community at large involved in new clinical trials. Project Narrative Repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to accelerating proof-of-concept and ultimately therapeutic clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose a bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, using available expression data from AD brains in the public domain as our “laboratory” and electronic heath records(EHR) as our “clinical trial infrastructure”. Resulting data packages from these analyses will be shared on Open Science platforms and will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies, ultimately leading to new clinical trials.",Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease,9974450,R01AG058063,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lewy Bodies', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular Target', 'National Health Services', 'Network-based', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cell type', 'cheminformatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'disease registry', 'drug candidate', 'drug testing', 'gene discovery', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'large datasets', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'open data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'protein expression', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tau phosphorylation', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational study']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,759291,0.13941332041490703
"Development of a Caregiver Application and AI-Enabled Intelligent Assistant to Support Families and Formal Care Providers in Caring for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT Family caregivers face daunting challenges in caring for persons with Alzheimer’s disease. Currently, there is no widely available mechanism to provide real-time, context sensitive support to informal AD caregivers that can address the specific care needs of each AD patient. To address this critical gap, we developed CareVirtue, an innovative web/mobile application for family caregivers that also assists formal care providers helping these families. During this Phase I project we will validate the CareVirtue web/mobile application as a method for caregivers to document daily care interactions with AD patients, and establish the utility of the generated data to develop predictive models for an intelligent caregiver assistant application. Looking ahead, our long term goal is to commercialize an AI-enabled intelligent caregiver assistant application that provides on demand, highly-relevant information about AD patients to care teams, which will ameliorate caregiver stress & burden, reduce health care expenditures, and improve quality of care for both AD patients and their caregivers.

"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,10018621,R44AG060857,"['Affect', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Clocks', 'Building Codes', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Feeds', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Phototherapy', 'Planet Earth', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Wakefulness', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'active control', 'alertness', 'appropriate dose', 'awake', 'base', 'biological systems', 'circadian', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'design', 'dosage', 'effectiveness testing', 'experience', 'falls', 'field study', 'health data', 'improved', 'interest', 'meter', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prototype', 'residence', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIA,"ERIK PAGE AND ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2020,1232387,0.1732898796559532
"Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Over the last decade, scientists have accelerated their efforts to understand Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This has led to unprecedented knowledge of the genetic and biological bases of AD risk, and vast stores of valuable data for further mining. Understanding the genetic and biological risk states for AD is, in itself, extraordinarily valuable for guiding mechanistic studies, developing better diagnostics, and formulating therapeutics. But an understanding of risk states also has the benefit of allowing research on resilience to AD. Research on the genetic and biological bases of resilience necessarily lags behind the discovery of risk factors. Now, as the risk architecture of AD is coming into view, it is feasible to study resilience to AD in individuals who are cognitively normal despite being at elevated risk for the disease. The approach we have devised for identifying resilience factors is straightforward yet, to our knowledge, unprecedented. We identify unaffected individuals at the highest levels of multivariate risk, match them to affected individuals at equivalent levels of risk, and contrast these two subgroups to find residual variation associated with the absence of disease. In this project, we will capitalize on the wealth of existing high-throughput AD risk-factor results and data, and our involvement in many of the world’s largest AD consortia, to efficiently map resilience to AD at three levels (genetics, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging), and to integrate across these levels. In Aim 1, we will identify genetic variation associated with resilience to AD in the presence of elevated genetic risk conferred by APOE ε4 alleles, an elevated AD polygenic risk score, or an elevated AD polygenic hazard score. In Aim 2, we will mega-analyze all available transcriptomic data from studies of postmortem hippocampal tissue and of peripheral blood in AD to identify transcriptomic risk scores and machine-learning algorithms that maximally distinguish AD from cognitively normal control subjects, and scores and algorithms that then identify residual transcriptomic variation that offsets the transcriptomic risk in resilient controls. In Aim 3, we will identify an MRI-based structural brain signature that is associated with resilience to AD in the presence of an AD- associated cortical risk signature. Lastly, in our exploratory Aim 4, we will integrate genetic, transcriptomic, brain structural, and clinical data to identify biological relationships across Aims, and novel phenotypes of resilience. Collectively, these Aims will identify multivariate, genetic, transcriptomic, and brain-structural profiles of resilience to AD, as well as molecular, neurobiological, and clinical phenotypes stemming from AD- resilience genotypes. Project Narrative Not all people at high risk for Alzheimer's disease develop the disorder. This project aims to identify genes, molecules, and brain structures that protect some people from their otherwise-elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Finding the biological basis for resilience to Alzheimer's disease may shed light on better options for diagnosing, treating, and even preventing the illness, in ways that can't be found by only studying people who already have the disease.","Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease",10017121,R01AG064955,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'phenome', 'polygenic risk score', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'structured data', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,760528,0.26724490604967216
"Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting 1 in 8 individuals over 65 years old in the US. Within AD, approximately 40-60% individuals are affected by psychotic symptoms (AD+P), which are associated with more rapid cognitive decline, greater disability, mortality and caregiver burden, resulting in a disproportionately large disease burden. Recent studies indicate a genetic basis for AD+P risk, but the molecular basis of AD+P remains largely uncharacterized, hindering the search for appropriate treatments and novel therapeutics. In this proposal, we seek to systematically dissect the mechanistic basis of AD+P by systematic generation, integration, and experimental dissection of transcriptional and epigenomic phenotypes across two brain regions and four cell types. (1) We profile single-cell RNA-seq and cell-type specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq across 192 post-mortem brain samples, each in two regions across AD patients with psychosis, AD patients with no psychosis, schizophrenia patients with no AD, and control individuals. (2) We integrate the resulting datasets with genetic information and GWAS data to predict driver genes, regions, variants, and pathways underlying AD+P using state-of-the-art machine learning methods for causality, mediation analysis, and genetic Bayesian fine- mapping. (3) We use our computational predictions to guide a systematic dissection of the molecular underpinnings of AD+P using a modular and programmable CRISPR-Cas9 methodology in iPSC lines to modulate regulatory elements, genes and alleles, and measure the resulting molecular and cellular phenotypes in cell-autonomous and non-autonomous phenotypes. If successful, this ambitious proposal has the potential to provide the first mechanistic insights on the development of psychotic symptoms in AD+P and/or P-AD, reveal functional risk variants and target genes for therapeutic intervention that will likely influence clinical management in order to alleviate the personal and societal burden associated with these disorders.

"Complexity of FMRI in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Considerable efforts have been spent in the past two decades to search for biomarkers for pre-symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For neuroimaging, amyloid-PET imaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is considered an early marker for the preclinical stage of AD, while tau-PET imaging correlates more closely with neuronal injury and cognitive decline. However, PET scans are expensive and involve radioactive tracers. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies in AD have shown that the functional connectivity (FC) of resting brain networks is progressively diminished in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. However, FC analysis of rs-fMRI has limited capability to characterize the dynamic fluctuations of rs-fMRI signals that possess clinically meaningful information. Our group and others have recently explored the use of entropy measures as indices of the complexity and regularity of rs-fMRI time-series. Accumulating data showed decreasing entropy values associated with aging, APOE ɛ4 genotype, cognitive decline in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD). Our group began developing the Complexity Toolbox in 2013 as the first systematic and comprehensive software package dedicated to complexity analysis of neuroimaging (fMRI) data. In particular, a recent independent study using our toolbox to analyze the rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study reported progressive reductions of entropy from healthy controls, early MRI, to late MCI and AD groups, with significant associations between complexity measures of rs-fMRI and cognitive decline in MCI/AD subjects. Our preliminary data in ADAD and LOAD subjects further showed consistent negative correlations between rs-fMRI entropy and tau-PET signal. The goal of this project is to further develop our Complexity Toolbox and a cloud-based pipeline for comprehensive complexity analysis of (large scale) fMRI data. We will systematically evaluate the complexity of fMRI as a novel imaging marker of AD in both ADAD and LOAD populations, using 3 public databases of rs- fMRI and PET including Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), Connectome of ADAD, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3) with a total sample size >900. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning techniques to evaluate complexity of rs-fMRI as a predictor for transversion from healthy to MCI and to AD. We will generate a disease staging model based on multimodal AD biomarkers including PET, CSF and rs-fMRI measures. We hypothesize that the complexity of BOLD signals provides an index of the information processing capacity of regional neuron populations, and is therefore sensitive to tau- related neuronal injury and cognitive decline in the AD processes. The successful completion of this project will lead to a noninvasive, economical and alternative imaging biomarker of neuronal injury in MCI and AD with relevant tools ready to be deployed in clinical research and care of AD. Relevance to Public Health Biomarkers for pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become increasingly important for the development of preventative interventions. For neuroimaging, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein provide early imaging markers of AD and can track disease progression but are expensive and require the use of radioactive tracers. This project aims to develop and evaluate a noninvasive, quantitative and economical imaging marker of AD based on the complexity or regularity of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).",Complexity of FMRI in Alzheimer's Disease,9944256,R01AG066711,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Entropy', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inherited', 'Ions', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'abeta accumulation', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'functional MRI scan', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'mutation carrier', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'tau Proteins', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,653961,0.14363434288418228
"Identification and Characterization of Common Pathways across Alzheimer Disease Genotypes using a Multiomic Approach Alzheimer disease (AD) is a multigenic and multifactorial condition with a common pathological hallmark, deposition of Aβ and tau proteins aggregates in the brain. A few genes have been directly involved in the protein deposition metabolism. Another 24 loci have been identified as risk factors for AD which have shed light into other impaired mechanisms. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how all these pathways are interrelated towards a same ending phenotype. Omic technologies have been instrumental in complementing our understanding of the pathways involved between disruption of particular loci and final pathology. However, each one of these studies only explains a modest portion of the pathology of AD, whilst complex diseases involve a highly dynamic and interactive system of molecular layers. The central hypothesis is that different molecular layers are interconnected in AD so that the dysregulation of any of these causes the ultimate AD phenotype (Aβ and tau proteins aggregates). Multi-omic analysis can provide an insight into how different molecular dimensions interact with each other, an insight that single omic data cannot provide. Also, there is limited availability of multi-omic data collected on the same group of individuals and tissue. The objective of this project is to identify dysregulated pathways consistent across molecilar layers. In the K99 phase of the award, I plan to generate single-omic profiles (transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) from brain tissue from highly characterized individuals. I will also leverage existing GWAs data for these individuals to conduct pair-wise integrative analysis to identify common variants that act as genetic regulators (QTL) for the identified dysregulated molecular markers. To conduct these analyses, I will gain training in network and pathway analysis, but also in big data and machine learning methods. During this period, I will also receive training in handling of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) and in functional analysis. Preliminary analysis using transcriptomic data have identified AGFG2 gene to be overexpressed across AD etiologies compared to controls. AGFG2 is an astrocyte expressed gene that seems to be involved in Aβ metabolism. During the K99 phase I will examine the role of AGFG2 in iPSC-derived astrocytes from AD patients' carriers of known pathogenic mutations (ADAD). Having acquired this knowledge, during the R00 phase I will explore whether dysregulation of AGFG2 has the same effect in ADAD as in iPSC-derived astrocytes from early onset and late onset AD patients. Finally, I will elevate the pair-wise integration of omic data to a meta-dimensional level. This will allow me to identify molecular signals (transcripts, proteins, metabolites) that are consistent across molecular layers. If successful, this project has the potential to reveal novel insights of AD biology, which will be of interest to the scientific community. In addition, with this award I will develop a translational profile which will be invaluable for establishing me as an independent investigator in the growing field of systems biology. Project Narrative This study will use multi-omic data from brain tissue from Alzheimer disease (AD) cases and healthy individuals to identify biological abnormalities that are consistent across molecular layers which will be validated on iPSc.

"Dementia and Heart Failure in the Community In response to PA-17-089, we propose exploratory analyses with an existing epidemiologic heart failure (HF) cohort linked to electronic health record (EHR) data to address the combined burden of coexisting Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and HF. We will capitalize on the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) and apply novel data science methods to existing community datasets. Recent adverse trends in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality are due to a major increase in HF deaths, and the uncontrolled epidemic of HF compromises progress against CVD. Addressing the epidemic of HF, a disease of aging populations, requires understanding how coexisting conditions interact with HF to impact outcomes and health care utilization. AD/ADRD occupies a distinct position within coexisting conditions as HF increases the risk of AD/ADRD, in part, via shared pathways. However, this association and, in particular, which phenotype of the heterogeneous HF syndrome is associated with AD/ADRD is not well known. AD/ADRD can adversely impact the outcomes of HF, a serious chronic disease that requires effective self-management and cognitive skills.  Yet, how AD/ADRD impacts health care utilization and outcomes in HF is not well understood. These knowledge gaps can be addressed by secondary analyses of existing data. Our objectives are to study, in an epidemiological cohort, the characteristics of HF that impart a higher risk of AD/ADRD, and the impact of AD/ADRD on outcomes (death, cardiovascular events, hospitalizations and admission to skilled nursing facility). Our proposal directly addresses key points of the PA, such as “Effects of specific combinations of two or more comorbid conditions on risks for specific adverse health outcomes, impact of specific combinations of two or more chronic conditions, …interactions among disease processes, and health outcomes in complex older patients with multiple chronic conditions.” This work will capitalize on a large epidemiological HF cohort linked to comprehensive EHR data within the rich environment of the REP, optimally suited to our proposed secondary analyses. This proposal leverages the experience of our team with the epidemiology of HF and with novel data science methods readily applicable to secondary analyses of existing EHR data sets. Aim 1 will apply machine learning to discover HF phenotypes associated with AD/ADRD while considering cardiac function, occurrence of atrial fibrillation and other coexisting conditions. Aim 2 will evaluate the impact of AD/ADRD on outcomes of HF. Conducting this work in a cohort within a geographically defined population and extensive longitudinal follow up will ensure that our results reflect the experience of community patients with HF. An improved understanding of the coexistence of AD/ADRD and HF will establish the prevalence of this association in the community and characterize the type of HF associated with AD/ADRD, which may allow earlier diagnosis, thereby enabling interventions to prevent or forestall early disease. Finally, improving our knowledge of how AD/ADRD affects outcomes will foster more precise management.

"Naturalistic Event Representation as a Novel Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease By 2060, the number of Americans 65 and older is projected to more than double from 46 million to 98 million, 24% of the total population. With this comes an increased prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which will create significant burden on our society and government. At present, screening tools capable of differentiating healthy aging from AD are most effective a decade or more after the preclinical stage, when potential treatments would be most effective. Thus, discovery of novel and specific tools for assessing the aging brain are of utmost importance. Typical studies of cognitive ability involve recognition of learned objects or simple word associations. However, in real-world situations, the content of an event is segmented from a flow of multimodal information. Segmentation and representation of events is supported by a posterior-medial network (PMN) of brain areas. Critically, this very same brain network features the first regions affected by pathological accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ), a key characteristic of AD. A recent report from an NIA working group defined asymptomatic Aβ accumulation as the earliest indicator of preclinical AD. Given the functional role of the PMN, we propose that this stage of disease may not be truly asymptomatic: subtle functional deficits may be evident if properly probed. To address this, we have developed a naturalistic paradigm to characterize event representation in the brain and subsequent memory. We aim to test the novel hypotheses that the brain’s ability to segment and represent complex events is compromised in preclinical AD, and that the extent of this disruption is predictive of deficient memory for the experienced events. We will acquire functional MRI (fMRI) scans while participants view a video narrative depicting naturalistic scenarios. We will additionally test memory performance related to details of the events depicted in the video both in and out of the scanner. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and machine learning analyses of functional MRI (fMRI) data, we will examine differences in the way the brain represents events into advanced aging in participants with and without ‘asymptomatic’ amyloid deposition (status obtained via existing PET scan data). This combination of approaches is highly innovative because current translational measures do not assess memory for rich, dynamic events that make up the majority of real-world experience. This project is expected to significantly improve our understanding of neural and cognitive disruptions that differentiate healthy aging from preclinical AD. By studying how the brain chunks and represents events, and how this relates to memory for those events, we can reveal significant insights into the way AD-related pathology affects day-to-day living. This can provide a mechanistic framework for understanding subtle, subjective memory complaints. The results of this work are anticipated to significantly advance our understanding of memory decline in the earliest possible stages of AD, providing a mechanistic basis for subtle issues that have to date been difficult to assess in the clinic. The ability to parse and represent complex events is a cornerstone of cognition and memory, and is dramatically affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The goal of this project is to use brain imaging and behavioral tests to understand how neural event representations are impacted by preclinical AD compared to healthy aging. The results will help us to understand early differences between healthy aging and AD, and it will help clinicians to develop novel screening tools.",Naturalistic Event Representation as a Novel Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease,9912695,R03AG063224,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Related Memory Disorders', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'abeta accumulation', 'abeta deposition', 'aging brain', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'movie', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2020,157000,0.14586451666286632
"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET- positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points – baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD all measures; controls – clinical and cognitive measures only) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow more than 400 people with EOAD in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS),9949580,U01AG057195,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Language', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Presenile Alzheimer Dementia', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Procedures', 'Psychometrics', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'age related', 'biomarker development', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disorder control', 'genetic risk factor', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'presenilin-1', 'recruit', 'risk variant', 'serial imaging', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment trial']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2020,15954813,0.20113652045061486
"MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a leading cause of disability and death in the US and major global public health problem due to rise in aging population resulting in untold suffering, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies is certain. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Our application is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing to leverage an innovative molecular imaging platform invented at Stanford, multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI). We will determine the high dimensional cellular and subcellular protein-level expression, interaction, and localization for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomic and proteomic studies in resilience and pathologic states using human brain sections from an ongoing proteomic investigation of AD. We hypothesize that in-depth, stage-specific phenotypic signatures extracted from these unique groups will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. We will test our hypothesis through three Specific Aims: (1) Establish a subcellular, phenotypic framework of vulnerable and resistant brain areas. Next-generation MIBI equipment will be used to rigorously image 30+ proteins simultaneously; targets marking subtypes of neurons, synapses, non-neuronal cells, neuro-inflammatory, and vascular components will be concurrently measured. (2) Reveal cognitive resilience multiplexed phenotypes. Using approaches we have successfully applied in other single cell studies, we will analyze multiplexed imaging data with statistical deep learning methods already established in our lab to identify topological, cellular, and molecular phenotypic differences among resilient, co- morbid, and AD dementia. (3) Implement a shared data repository. The power of multiplexed imaging in biology is its ability to reveal co-localization or mutual exclusivity to infer regulatory roles and gain mechanistic insight. To disseminate hundreds of these images from our proposed highly multiplexed study, we will create a web-based portal, using already established infrastructure, where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi-color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features will be shared freely. PROJECT NARRATIVE AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the aging American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. Such signatures will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. Such insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets, as well as create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD.",MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease,9974453,R01AG057915,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Electrons', 'Equipment', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lobule', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'abeta accumulation', 'aging population', 'collaborative approach', 'comorbidity', 'computational pipelines', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'disease-causing mutation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nanometer resolution', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'presenilin', 'presenilin-1', 'presenilin-2', 'resilience', 'response to injury', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tissue resource', 'vascular factor', 'web portal']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,879166,0.18604110527696535
"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias that are associated with major adverse effects on daily function and quality of life, and accelerate time to institutionalization. Of all the NPS, depression is the most frequently observed symptom in people with mild cognitive impairment and early AD. As the disease progresses, agitation, delusions and hallucinations become more common, whereas apathy is the most persistent and frequent NPS throughout all the stages of AD. AD- NPS share some clinical features with serious mental illnesses (SMIs), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but whether these conditions share similar aethiopathies is unclear. Given that reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias do not exist, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses is a critical next step to identify reliable biomarkers that could lead to novel therapeutics.  There are two overarching goals of this proposal. First, we will identify the molecular mechanisms and neuropathological changes that are associated with the presence of NPS in patients with AD. Second, we will examine if the mechanisms of pathology associated with NPS are shared or distinct among AD and SMIs. More specifically, we propose to build multi-scale integrative models using phenomics and genomics data from 1,264 autopsy cases derived from a single brain bank. The bank includes detailed phenomics data such as well characterized NPS, clinical diagnosis (AD and other neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric traits), severity of cognitive decline and neuropathology for each patient sample. From each case, we will apply innovative approaches that reduce the cost and technical biases associated with conventional methods, and capture gene expression signatures and epigenetic regulatory elements at the single-cell level. Novel deep-learning methods will be applied for the multi-scale integration of neuropathologic changes with genetic markers and functional genomic changes (such as changes in gene expression and enhancer sequences) within specific cell types, to predict various NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric traits; we refer to these integrative models as genotype- marker-phenotype models. We expect that these models will enable us to assign genotypes and molecular markers to specific NPS within AD and other neuropsychiatric traits at the single-cell level, an unprecedented level of resolution. In addition, we will test the translational potential of the genotype-marker-phenotype models to predict AD-NPS using independent large-scale biobank datasets, in which genotypes and electronic health records are available. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have immediate utility by generating potential biomarkers for NPS diagnosis and prognosis and by providing predictive models for patient stratification in clinical trials. In the longer term, our models will help us create a blueprint for therapeutic strategies and interventions to treat NPS in AD. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, that contributes to early institutionalization and causes substantial caregiving and caregiver burden. Despite decades of research, reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias have not been found.

We expect that these models will enable us to assign genotypes and molecular markers to specific NPS within AD and other neuropsychiatric traits at the single-cell level, an unprecedented level of resolution. In addition, we will test the translational potential of the genotype-marker-phenotype models to predict AD-NPS using independent large-scale biobank datasets, in which genotypes and electronic health records are available. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have immediate utility by generating potential biomarkers for NPS diagnosis and prognosis and by providing predictive models for patient stratification in clinical trials. In the longer term, our models will help us create a blueprint for therapeutic strategies and interventions to treat NPS in AD. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, that contributes to early institutionalization and causes substantial caregiving and caregiver burden. Despite decades of research, reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias have not been found.

"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs ABSTRACT. This Supplement extends Aims 1 and 2 of the parent grant on Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) by developing: prospective benchmarks for algorithms that predict biomarkers of disease risk (Aim 1) and new algorithms to support drug repositioning (Aim 2). Both extensions strengthen Aims 1 and 2 for AD but also have immediate applications for research on COVID-19 disease in keeping with NOT-AG-20-022. AIM 1 of the parent grant develops EA-ML, a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline to compare coding mutations in individuals with and without AD. The output is a list of genes with which to predict AD risk from their mutations. While the parent grant has multiple criteria for success, none are prospective given the vast lead-time between AD onset and symptoms. Supplemental Aim 1 adds prospective testing, using COVID-19. This is possible because the UK Biobank has begun to annotate its 50,000 public exomes with the COVID-19 status of individuals, including who had severe morbidity or mild symptoms at worst. The biobank will also add 150,000 more exomes by end 2020. Accordingly, we will apply EA-ML to the current UK biobank data to identify human genetic biomarkers that distinguish severe from mild cases and then test EA-ML predictions of COVID-19 virulence prospectively, on the exomes that are newly added to the biobank. As a further new benchmark, we will also compare EA-ML to a novel “EA-Wavelet” algorithm, also tested prospectively on COVID-19. EA- Wavelet sorts cases from controls by factoring EA over the entire network of human protein-protein interactions. The results will tell us which of EA-ML, EA-Wavelet, or combination thereof is the best at identifying critical biomarkers and clinical risk of AD, while also doing the same for COVID-19. Aim 2 of the parent grant develops drug repositioning for AD by linking target genes and drugs via knowledge maps of functional interactions. Here, we propose a complementary approach that connect genes to drugs via structural maps of binding epitopes. For this we will comprehensively map evolutionarily important sites in the structural proteome of genes that are associated with AD. The approach exploits EA theory to measure past and present evolutionary forces in fitness landscapes, and it takes into account current sequence variations to guard against any possible mutational escape from drugs that target these epitopes. The output will be surface accessible regions of proteins that can then be used for (i) computational docking of small molecules towards drug repurposing, combination therapy, and lead discovery for drug design3-5; (ii) engineering mimetic peptides or other molecules that can inhibit normal interactions6; and (iii) CRISPR engineering or peptide synthesis that create antigens for more effective vaccines7, 8. These automated mapping tools are general, and besides in SARS-CoV-2, will identify an entire new structural library of functional sites to target for AD therapy with repurposed drugs. This Supplement will extend the computational Aims 1 and 2 of the parent grant on Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Supplemental Aim 1 will provide, by way of COVID-19, the first ever rigorous tests that benchmark our new algorithms prospectively, so that we can use them in AD to identify predictive biomarkers and clinical risk of developing disease with a better understanding of their strengths and limitations, and Supplemental Aim 2 will develop a new approach to link disease driver genes to drugs based on the identification of structural epitopes that can then serve as binding targets for drug repositioning or vaccine development. Both supplemental aims make use of COVID-19 data to develop and test these capabilities which will then be put to immediate use in AD, serving the dual mission of improving disease surveillance and therapy in both COVID-19 and AD.",A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs,10198233,R01AG061105,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Antigens', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Calculi', 'Catalysis', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Emergency Situation', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Markers', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Patient risk', 'Peptide Synthesis', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Site', 'Solvents', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Viral Genes', 'Virulence', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'knowledge graph', 'mimetics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parent grant', 'peptidomimetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'small molecule', 'success', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'web site']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,386555,0.20456029207118911
"TMS in preclinical and prodromal AD: Modulation of brain networks and memory Project Summary  In the prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), beta-amyloid (AB) and tau preferentially spread throughout the default mode network (DMN) leading to neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction. Episodic memory impairments in AD are thought to arise from the loss of structural and functional connectivity between nodes of the DMN. Emerging evidence from studies with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in young adults demonstrate that the DMN can be modulated in a manner that promotes lasting episodic memory improvement. However, several fundamental questions remain regarding the factors that govern whether rTMS is effective in patients with Alzheimer's pathology and neurodegeneration.  The primary goal of this proposal is to refine our understanding of the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of rTMS for enhancing DMN integrity and episodic memory in individuals with Alzheimer's pathology. 30 patients with prodromal AD, 30 AB+ cognitively normal older adults, and 30 AB- cognitively normal older adults will each undergo 5 days of sham-controlled rTMS preceded and followed by multimodal MRI sessions and cognitive testing. rTMS targets will be established using baseline functional connectivity derived from resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) to determine the region in lateral parietal cortex with maximal functional connectivity to the hippocampus. rsfMRI outcome measures will include functional connectivity between the stimulation site and hippocampus, and intrinsic activity within the stimulation site and hippocampus. AB, tau, and FDG positron emission tomography (PET) scans and structural MRI will be used to quantify the impact of Alzheimer's pathology, hypometabolism, and atrophy on the efficacy of rTMS treatments in each group. All outcome measures will be related to behavioral measures of episodic memory immediately and 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Aim 1 of the proposed project will establish the effects of rTMS on episodic memory in each group. Aim 2 will establish functional network effects of rTMS in each group. Aim 3 will use multivariate regression and machine learning algorithms to identify the biological features that are most useful in predicting whether an individual will benefit from rTMS.  All data collection and analyses will take place at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. During the completion of the project the candidate will receive training in the theory and application of TMS to modulate network function, the use of PET imaging to measure pathology in AD, clinical trial design, and the use of advanced biostatistics for biomarker development and treatment response prediction. The outcome of this research will provide insight into the individuals that are most likely to benefit from rTMS, and will inform future studies seeking to optimize rTMS treatments to improve cognition in dementia. Furthermore, the completion of this project will lay the foundation for the candidate's long-term goal of translating basic neuroimaging findings from healthy aging to direct benefits for patients with Alzheimer's disease. The proposed research examines the potential benefits of non-invasive repetitive transcranial brain stimulation (rTMS) to behavior and memory neurocircuitry in older adults and patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. The outcome of this research will provide critical insight into the individuals that are most likely to benefit from rTMS, and to inform future studies seeking to optimize rTMS treatments to improve cognition in dementia.

"Circadian Organization and Disorder in Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT With an aging population, the impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on public health continues to explode. Altered daily rhythms in physiology and behavior are prominent features of AD. These altered activity rhythms are difficult to treat, disrupting the lives of both patients and caregivers. Mounting evidence suggests that these changes are more than just symptoms. Altered rhythms may contribute to AD progression and development. Many important transcripts, proteins, and metabolites oscillate with a daily cycle. Understanding these rhythms, and their influence on AD, offers the potential to identify new therapies. The translation of circadian biology to Alzheimer's care is limited. Which molecules and pathways show daily rhythms in our human brains? How do those rhythms change with AD? Do changes in molecular rhythms explain changing behavioral patterns? Can these rhythms be exploited for therapeutic benefit? To answer clinical questions, we need human data. AD brain banks provide an invaluable resource. But brain banks almost never provide the time of day when patients died, making it difficult to use these data for rhythms research. We developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure), a machine-learning tool to uncover molecular rhythms using unordered biopsy samples. Evaluating brain expression data, we showed that CYCLOPS could correctly reconstruct rhythms in brain samples and correctly predict the time of death. Here we will order cortical brain samples from control subjects and patients with AD. We will reconstruct the molecular rhythms in these human brains, identifying differences in AD patients and rhythms in known drug targets and AD disease pathways. We will analyze a subset of samples where time of death is known, comparing each subject's “internal molecular time” with the “time on the clock.” We will test the hypothesis that patients with poorly aligned molecular rhythms are more likely to have circadian behavioral disturbance. We will evaluate a measure of transcriptional rhythm strength, testing if “weaker” rhythms predict behavioral or molecular misalignment. Does AD alter rhythm generation? Does it desynchronize still rhythmic cells and brain regions? Using data from multiple brain regions sampled from the same subjects, we will evaluate intracortical circadian synchrony and compare AD patients with controls. Using single-nucleus sequencing data, we will explore the effect of AD on cell type specific rhythms and their synchrony. Finally, we will test the direct influence of important AD causing mutations on molecular clock function, measuring rhythms in isolated cells. This work will advance our understanding of circadian rhythms in AD pathology, clarify the relationship between behavioral and molecular circadian disruption, and catalyze opportunities for AD chronotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep and circadian disruption are prominent features of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. This work will help researchers understand how molecular rhythms in the brain may influence the progression of AD, contribute to the sleep disruption experienced by AD patients, and influence the time at which AD targeted medications will be most effective.",Circadian Organization and Disorder in Alzheimer's Disease,10046080,R01AG068577,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biology', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronotherapy', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Nuclear', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Update', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cell type', 'circadian', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'metabolome', 'mind control', 'molecular clock', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein metabolite', 'relating to nervous system', 'risk variant', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,388090,0.26947816235755445
"A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life ABSTRACT  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a group of progressive, terminal illnesses that will affect an estimated 14-million people in the United States by the year 2050. Caregivers experience chronic stress and they report feeling burdened and unprepared for making difficult end-of-life (EOL) care decisions, which may lead to unnecessary hospitalizations or avoidable transitions in care that affect end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL). Advance care planning (ACP), which improves EOL-QOL, is the gold-standard approach for improving concordance between preferences and actual care received at EOL. However, despite decades of research aimed at raising their rates, only 50% of those with AD/ADRD have a written ACP. Furthermore, there is a lack of current research evidence investigating the factors associated with transitions in care and EOL-QOL for persons with AD/ADRD, which could help guide EOL decision-making. To date, the state of the science is primarily cross-sectional in nature, and does not account for the influence of trajectories of decline, the effect these changes have on caregivers, nor how longitudinal changes in caregiving ultimately affect EOL care outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need to discover new approaches for preparing persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making informed, in-the-moment decisions, to ensure high EOL-QOL care and to support appropriate transitions in care as circumstances change over time. Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and National Study on Caregiving (NSOC), we plan to use a machine learning based framework to identify the key determinants for predicting the risk for EOL care transitions and the traits of EOL-QOL among older adults residing in the community. This study has two specific aims: 1) Develop predictive model of factors related to end-of-life care transitions (e.g. inpatient death versus hospice) in persons with AD/ADRD longitudinally; and 2) Develop a predictive model of factors related to end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) in persons with AD/ADRD. Discovering knowledge in a large population- level dataset is foundational for the future development of a generalizable/scalable model for guiding persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers as they navigate a fragmented healthcare system while making difficult decisions for their loved ones. Our approach fills a critical gap between the current approaches for improving EOL-QOL and EOL transitions in care that focus on ACP as a singular outcome, by addressing the comprehensive needs of individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers that change over time. Our study will provide a predictive model for EOL-QOL and EOL care transitions. This is a critical first step for the future development of an approach for personalizing care to guide persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making EOL care decisions. These results will have an important positive impact on EOL care, which aligns with the strategic goals of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) and Nursing Research (NINR) to address clinical and translational gaps in the study of EOL care needs of people with AD/ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are at high risk for experiencing burdensome care transitions, avoidable hospitalizations, and poor end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) due to the increasing prevalence of multiple chronic illness and escalating demands placed on caregivers, resulting in significant personal and public socioeconomic burdens. Decades of research has focused on improving the rates of advance care plans above 50% among persons with AD/ADRD, however, others may benefit more from personalized guidance to help navigate the trajectory of decline that supports timely, “in the moment” medical decision making. This study addresses Goals 2 and 3 of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease to enhance care quality and efficiency and expand support for persons with AD/ADRD by identifying factors related to poor EOL-QOL and care transitions in the context of caregiving for the future development of a personalized approach to support in the moment healthcare decision-making.",A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life,9958923,R03AG067159,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospice Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Terminal Disease', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States', 'Update', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'inpatient service', 'loved ones', 'novel strategies', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'secondary analysis', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend']",NIA,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R03,2020,79750,0.096582934072419
"Identification and Characterization of Common Pathways across Alzheimer Disease Genotypes using a Multiomic Approach Alzheimer disease (AD) is a multigenic and multifactorial condition with a common pathological hallmark, deposition of Aβ and tau proteins aggregates in the brain. A few genes have been directly involved in the protein deposition metabolism. Another 24 loci have been identified as risk factors for AD which have shed light into other impaired mechanisms. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how all these pathways are interrelated towards a same ending phenotype. Omic technologies have been instrumental in complementing our understanding of the pathways involved between disruption of particular loci and final pathology. However, each one of these studies only explains a modest portion of the pathology of AD, whilst complex diseases involve a highly dynamic and interactive system of molecular layers. The central hypothesis is that different molecular layers are interconnected in AD so that the dysregulation of any of these causes the ultimate AD phenotype (Aβ and tau proteins aggregates). Multi-omic analysis can provide an insight into how different molecular dimensions interact with each other, an insight that single omic data cannot provide. Also, there is limited availability of multi-omic data collected on the same group of individuals and tissue. The objective of this project is to identify dysregulated pathways consistent across molecilar layers. In the K99 phase of the award, I plan to generate single-omic profiles (transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) from brain tissue from highly characterized individuals. I will also leverage existing GWAs data for these individuals to conduct pair-wise integrative analysis to identify common variants that act as genetic regulators (QTL) for the identified dysregulated molecular markers. To conduct these analyses, I will gain training in network and pathway analysis, but also in big data and machine learning methods. During this period, I will also receive training in handling of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) and in functional analysis. Preliminary analysis using transcriptomic data have identified AGFG2 gene to be overexpressed across AD etiologies compared to controls. AGFG2 is an astrocyte expressed gene that seems to be involved in Aβ metabolism. During the K99 phase I will examine the role of AGFG2 in iPSC-derived astrocytes from AD patients' carriers of known pathogenic mutations (ADAD). Having acquired this knowledge, during the R00 phase I will explore whether dysregulation of AGFG2 has the same effect in ADAD as in iPSC-derived astrocytes from early onset and late onset AD patients. Finally, I will elevate the pair-wise integration of omic data to a meta-dimensional level. This will allow me to identify molecular signals (transcripts, proteins, metabolites) that are consistent across molecular layers. If successful, this project has the potential to reveal novel insights of AD biology, which will be of interest to the scientific community. In addition, with this award I will develop a translational profile which will be invaluable for establishing me as an independent investigator in the growing field of systems biology. Project Narrative This study will use multi-omic data from brain tissue from Alzheimer disease (AD) cases and healthy individuals to identify biological abnormalities that are consistent across molecular layers which will be validated on iPSc.

"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias that are associated with major adverse effects on daily function and quality of life, and accelerate time to institutionalization. Of all the NPS, depression is the most frequently observed symptom in people with mild cognitive impairment and early AD. As the disease progresses, agitation, delusions and hallucinations become more common, whereas apathy is the most persistent and frequent NPS throughout all the stages of AD. AD- NPS share some clinical features with serious mental illnesses (SMIs), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but whether these conditions share similar aethiopathies is unclear. Given that reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias do not exist, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses is a critical next step to identify reliable biomarkers that could lead to novel therapeutics.  There are two overarching goals of this proposal. First, we will identify the molecular mechanisms and neuropathological changes that are associated with the presence of NPS in patients with AD. Second, we will examine if the mechanisms of pathology associated with NPS are shared or distinct among AD and SMIs. More specifically, we propose to build multi-scale integrative models using phenomics and genomics data from 1,264 autopsy cases derived from a single brain bank. The bank includes detailed phenomics data such as well characterized NPS, clinical diagnosis (AD and other neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric traits), severity of cognitive decline and neuropathology for each patient sample. From each case, we will apply innovative approaches that reduce the cost and technical biases associated with conventional methods, and capture gene expression signatures and epigenetic regulatory elements at the single-cell level. Novel deep-learning methods will be applied for the multi-scale integration of neuropathologic changes with genetic markers and functional genomic changes (such as changes in gene expression and enhancer sequences) within specific cell types, to predict various NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric traits; we refer to these integrative models as genotype- marker-phenotype models. We expect that these models will enable us to assign genotypes and molecular markers to specific NPS within AD and other neuropsychiatric traits at the single-cell level, an unprecedented level of resolution. In addition, we will test the translational potential of the genotype-marker-phenotype models to predict AD-NPS using independent large-scale biobank datasets, in which genotypes and electronic health records are available. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have immediate utility by generating potential biomarkers for NPS diagnosis and prognosis and by providing predictive models for patient stratification in clinical trials. In the longer term, our models will help us create a blueprint for therapeutic strategies and interventions to treat NPS in AD.

The proposed studies will generate and integrate high- dimensional phenomics and genomics data in human brain tissue, that will inform us about the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in the context of AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses.",Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease,10150353,R01AG067025,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Adverse effects', 'Aerosols', 'Agitation', 'Air', 'Air Pressure', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Autopsy', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutionalization', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mycoplasma', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biobank', 'brain tissue', 'care giving burden', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular marker', 'neuropathology', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'severe mental illness', 'shear stress', 'trait']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,250000,0.27016030401158225
"The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD Project Summary Improving vascular health for delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is identified as a critical goal by the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Conference, the 2015 NIA AD Summit and PAR-15-356 (to which this application is responding). Yet, critical barriers exist to implementing vascular prevention strategies for AD, and elucidating the role of midlife metabolic, macro- and micro- vascular factors in AD is essential to addressing these barriers. Each type of factor may manifest different pathologies in the brain that contribute to dementia sub-types, making a new and sufficiently comprehensive clinical trial a costly and time-consuming undertaking. To address this essential gap, we propose to leverage the rich longitudinal cohort data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study with the addition of detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain neuroimaging – the MESA VASCAD study. MESA participants at the Wake Forest site (46% African-American, 54% non-Hispanic Caucasian) have already undergone extensive metabolic and vascular phenotyping, repeated retinal imaging and a brief cognitive assessment in 2010-2012. The MESA VASCAD study will add clinical and cognitive assessments (Uniform Data Set and supplemental cognitive tests); neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid PET); and reanalysis of retinal images. We propose to enroll 540 MESA participants in 2 years and repeat assessments 3 years later to more fully characterize targeted, modifiable vascular risk factors for AD. Through our Specific Aims, we will (1) test the hypothesis that baseline macrovascular and microvascular biomarkers in middle-age predict both standard AD neuroimaging outcomes (e.g. hippocampal volume and amyloid deposition assessed with PET) and more novel cerebrovascular biomarkers (e.g. microinfarcts, lacunar infarcts, neurite density and cerebral microbleeds); (2) determine if changes in metabolic and vascular biomarkers over 15 years predict cognitive and AD biomarker trajectory; and (3) using high-dimensional machine learning approaches, determine common, differential and interactive metabolic and vascular risk factor profiles among racial and APOE genotype groups. This proposed ancillary study, approved by the MESA Steering Committee, is led by a New Investigator with an experienced, multi- disciplinary team of collaborators. The MESA study is an ideal cohort for interrogating the questions in this proposal: it has highly detailed longitudinal risk factor data collected over 15+ years in a diverse cohort, which we can leverage and augment with cerebrovascular biomarkers, AD biomarkers, and cognitive reassessments - thereby creating a comprehensive brain phenotype dataset for vascular and AD risk factors. These new data will enable us to examine the timing and impact of vascular biomarkers on dementia biomarkers and cognitive trajectories before a diagnosis of pre-clinical and clinical AD-related disorders, meeting a critical gap in information that will help guide the development of novel therapeutic or prevention strategies for various forms of AD-related dementias. Project Narrative Vascular and metabolic disorders are proposed as potent modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and may provide key routes for therapeutic and preventive interventions. We propose to leverage the vast resources of the NIH-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study to examine the potential contributions of macrovascular and microvascular subclinical disease to AD-related pathology. At the Wake Forest MESA site, we will add neuroimaging, repeated cognitive testing, and reprocessing of existing digital retinal scans with novel measures of retinal microvascular architecture.",The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD,9928377,R01AG054069,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Age-Years', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Ancillary Study', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurites', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Route', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vascular Diseases', 'adjudicate', 'age related', 'arterial stiffness', 'brain health', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcium', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'digital', 'epigenetic marker', 'experience', 'falls', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'macrovascular disease', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pre-clinical', 'resilience', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'symposium', 'vascular contributions', 'vascular factor', 'vascular risk factor']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,773098,0.22363353595597946
"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology. The completion of our study aims will advance the development of an affordable screening tool that can be utilized in a clinical/community setting to identify individuals who are candidates for comprehensive diagnostic testing.",Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology,9988993,R01AG054523,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrum', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cost Measures', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical center', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'community clinic', 'community setting', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'glucose metabolism', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'ketogenic diet', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'minimally invasive', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'stem', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,752198,0.2503592496478446
"Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome Project ABSTRACT – Overall Behavioral, emotional and cognitive disorders have been historically studied as diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). However, emerging data suggests a gut-brain connection in a variety of diseases that affect the brain. Our own data and others’ suggests a gut-brain connection in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the leading cause of dementia. There are currently no therapies to prevent or slow AD progression, causing a huge socioeconomic burden and highlighting our incomplete knowledge. Given an emerging role for gut microbiome and hypotheses implicating viral and bacterial contributions to AD pathogenesis, defining the bidirectional biochemical communication between the brain and the gut will improve understanding of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Indeed, it is crucial to study the brain not in isolation, but in the context of peripheral influences including diet, lifestyle, and microbiome. In this proposal we build on large initiatives and infrastructures co-established by our multi-disciplinary team including: The American Gut Project, The AD Metabolomics Consortium, Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD), The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) and centers of excellence in informatics and systems biology. We aim to define the role of gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis and biochemical axis of communication between gut and brain. Aim 1: Examine the association between the gut microbiome and AD phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the biochemical axis of communication between the gut microbiome and the brain and identify metabolites that contribute to AD endophenotypes. Aim 3: Examine mechanistic links between the activity of the gut microbiome and AD pathogenesis, and identify new approaches for AD prevention that target the gut-brain axis. These aims will be enabled three projects supported by an Omics and Technology Core, a Computational and Systems Biology Core, and an Administrative Core that provides data and biorepository infrastructure. Project 1 will define changes in gut microbiome and metabolome across the AD trajectory; Project 2 leverages three existing clinical trials of controlled diets to examine dietary effects on gut microbiome, metabolome, cognition and brain imaging; Project 3 examines mechanism by defining gut- brain communication and microbiome-based interventions in animal models of AD. In this U19 we will create an unprecedented, high-quality dataset and resources specifically for the AD research community, and make these available under open science, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data principles. With our cross-disciplinary team of experts in clinical AD, gut microbiome research, imaging, metabolomics, informatics, deep learning and systems biology, this effort will yield novel biomarkers for AD progression and prognosis, and insight into mechanisms opening the door to development of transformative options for AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE – Overall Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurological disease in the US and evidence suggests that genetics, gut bacteria, diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposures contribute to human metabolism and its dysregulation in diseases including AD. Gut-brain biochemical axis are being identified and seem implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders like AD. Understanding how different diets can prevent or reverse AD, and targets that could be delivered microbioiologically or pharmacologically to persons who cannot or will not change their diet, is an important long-term goal in AD research, especially given the emerging understanding that responses to diet are highly individualized and dependent on the microbiome. The goal of the current project is to define the gut-brain-chemical axis of communication of the role of the gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis.",Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome Project,10017837,U19AG063744,"['3xTg-AD mouse', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amines', 'Animal Model', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Emotional disorder', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'FAIR principles', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Manipulative Therapies', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Microbe', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Translations', 'Viral', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Work', 'Xenobiotics', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cytotoxic', 'deep learning', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'fecal metabolome', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'outcome forecast', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'symposium']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,U19,2020,5424083,0.22550145719955328
"Investigating a molecular basis for Alzheimer's disease subtypes using multiomic data integration and machine-learning No abstract available Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease is a complex multifactorial disease affecting nearly 40 million individuals worldwide, and yet there are no approved therapies given our limited understanding of underlying genetic risk factors. Tremendous genetic heterogeneity in AD has made it challenging to use genetic data alone to determine prognostic genes that could be predictive of disease in the patient population. This proposal determines AD subtypes, or distinct molecular profiles of patients that are similar, based on integrated multiomic, imaging, and endophenotype data, as well as identifies potential therapeutic gene targets for each different subtype.",Investigating a molecular basis for Alzheimer's disease subtypes using multiomic data integration and machine-learning,10067860,F31AG069441,[' '],NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,0.111665712546348
"Fast multiparametric MR imaging as early biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Without a cure or prevention, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) rapidly will become an overwhelming economic and social burden. With the failure of multiple clinical trials targeting reduction of beta-amyloid (Aβ) burden and in general the stagnation of the development of effective treatment for AD, AD community believes that underlying causes of AD must be attacked before emergence of the cognitive phenotype. In this context, the development of predictive biomarkers and models is critical for identifying patients with high risk of rapid progression along the AD continuum, i.e. transitioning from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to dementia. Previous AD research has primarily been utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing morphological changes. Our preliminary results and other studies have shown that quantitative MR parameters such T1, T2, the magnetic susceptibility values are sensitive to normal ageing process and AD. However, their wide spread in AD research protocols has been limited due to scan time constraints. The overarching goal of the proposal is to establish a fast MR technique that does not increase overall scan time of a conventional MR protocol; and in addition to providing all the information the conventional protocol provides, it will also provide multiple quantitative parametric measurements specifically targeted to the needs of AD diagnosis and prognosis. We will 1) develop a fast and motion-insensitive MR technique (M3FAST-ECHO) that can generate multiple quantitative parameters within 10 minutes; 2) validate the volumetric measurement and microhemorrhage assessment from the synthetic 3D T1-weighted and the susceptibility weighted imaging from M3FAST-ECHO against standard ADNI protocol in 30 patients with mild cognitive impairment and 30 aged matched cognitively normal subjects; 3) compare quantitative T1, T2* and quantitative susceptibility values in 30 MCI patients and 30 aged matched cognitively normal subjects, and to correlate these metrics with neuropsychological measurements in the participants. The successful completion of the aims will result in a fast MR technique that provides multiple parametric MR maps without increasing overall scan time, and provide preliminary results for establishing values of quantitative MR parametric maps as sensitive biomarkers of AD. This will greatly enhance our ability to evaluate and screen for early predictive biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease. The inter-disciplinary team and infrastructure for AD research at Emory will ensure successful execution of the study and dissemination of the developed techniques to the entire AD research community.

"A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials PROJECT SUMMARY It is our hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous conditions and, therefore, a paradigm shift is required to identify specific subpopulations for targeted interventions. This approach has generated significant success in other complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. A key opportunity in this context is the identification of those most likely to benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs and other anti-inflammatory compounds. The relation between inflammation and the development of AD, MCI, and cognitive decline has received a great deal of attention with basic science and observational human studies demonstrating a protective effect against cognitive loss. Likewise, in our work, inflammation has been a key mechanism in the biological profile that is indicative of disease presence. Based on a wealth of literature (epidemiological, cross-sectional, pathobiological and animal model), multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the utility of NSAID compounds in treating or preventing AD (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study [ADCS] AD and MCI anti-inflammatory trials; Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial [ADAPT]); however, each of these studies failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit, in fact some patients may have exhibited worsening cognitive performance with treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that particular subsets of patients in these trials did benefit from treatment and that our blood-based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify both positive and adverse responders within these trials. Here we propose to leverage three previously conducted clinical trials to test our hypothesis that our blood- based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify the subsets of patients who benefited from these previously conducted clinical trials. By conducting proteomic assays from existing biorepositories from the ADCS and ADAPT, we will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate the utility of the proinflammatory endophenotype as a means for patient selection into NSAID therapy for treating and preventing AD; Specific Aim 2. To determine if change in proinflammatory endophenotype scores over time is a biomarker of therapeutic response. By leveraging a highly innovative method and substantial existing resources, the current project addresses a significant need in the search for novel approaches AD therapeutics. The significance of the current project is the identification of a specific subset of patients who will experience clinically significant cognitive benefit from administration of NSAID medication. If successful, the current project will set the stage for a novel clinical trial that enrolls patients specifically based on baseline proinflammatory endophenotype scores for administration of NSAID therapy. In the long-term, this line of research is designed to build a person-centered (i.e. personalized) approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's diseases are a growing public health crisis impacting millions of elders world-wide with a health care cost greater than cancer and equivalent to cardiovascular disease. Current treatments only slow progression of the disease and new strategies are urgently needed. The relevance of the current project is the validation of a person-centered approach to treating Alzheimer's disease by identifying specific subgroups that are most likely to respond to targeted therapies. The outcomes of this project will fundamentally change the approach to the search for novel therapies for AD from the “one-size-fits-all” approach to the search for specific subgroups that can be treated with targeted medications.",A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials,9888293,R01AG051848,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'IL18 gene', 'IL5 gene', 'IL6 gene', 'IL7 gene', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-10', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Naproxen', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Prevention trial', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'arm', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive benefits', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'response', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R01,2020,681564,0.1681821278576562
"Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer's (SARA) Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this Phase I Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) effort is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a socially integrative and supportive robot system to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). One in 10 people 65 and older has AD, with estimates of up to as many as 5.5 million Americans currently living with AD. Because of the loss of cognitive function and subsequent changes in employment and reduced engagement with social groups and hobbies, AD/ADRD patients often experience loneliness and social isolation, and the considerable challenge of caring for these individuals often causes similar effects in caregivers. If successful, SARA will have significant impact on AD/ADRD patient care and quality of life, reducing loneliness and social isolation.  The specific aims of this two-year pilot study are to: (1) adapt commercial robot and peripheral hardware to create accessible interactions for AD/ADRD patients; (2) design and develop the robot interaction software to provide rich, supportive interaction; and (3) assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of SARA with AD/ADRD older adults and their caregivers. SARA employs user-community-driven design processes and evaluations to address key challenges surrounding how to best apply commercial robots and engaging interaction methodologies to improve AD/ADRD patient care. We will develop SARA through an iterative development process that produces and evaluates three versions of the system during the Phase I effort.  SARA is significant in three ways. SARA reduces loneliness by providing robotic social interactions. SARA reduces social isolation by connecting the patient more closely with family, friends, and caregivers, both directly and through social media. SARA provides social assistance in three ways: (1) through automated reminders and question answering for everyday information that is easily and often forgotten by patients; (2) conveyance of health regimens (e.g., What can I have for lunch? Should I still exercise today?); and (3) monitoring for caregivers.  SARA contains three central innovations. First, to create a user experience that is well tuned to the needs of patients and caregivers, SARA is created with significant feedback from AD/ADRD patients and caregivers. Second, to enable us to build on multiple robotic platforms that can meet this user experience, and to provide future extensibility, SARA features a platform-agnostic software and hardware framework that can integrate with a wide range of consumer social robots. Third, to create engaging, believable, and effective interactions with AD/ADRD patients, SARA uses and extends an AI-based architecture, Hap, which is specifically designed to create socially engaging interactive characters and robots that provide enjoyable and stimulating interactions.

"UniProt - Enhancing functional genomics data access for the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and dementia-related protein research communities PROJECT SUMMARY UNIPROT - ENHANCING FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS DATA ACCESS FOR THE ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE (AD) AND DEMENTIA-RELATED PROTEIN RESEARCH COMMUNITIES - SUPPLEMENT REQUEST 2020 The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence KnowledgeBase (UniProtKB). Currently, 5.7 million US citizens are living with the effects of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), which is estimated to rise to 14 million by 2025. A National Plan has been implemented by the US aimed at preventing and effectively treating AD and related dementias by 2025. To support precision medicine based on genomic data, UniProt is tasked with providing a centralized resource that both links the genome to the functional proteins it encodes. It also efficiently identifies, captures and disseminates published information on protein function, facilitating computational analysis. The goal of this supplement is to further enhance the usability and content of the AD pages in the prototypic Disease Portal, in response to feedback obtained at a series of NIA-funded AD workshops. We will enable users access to protein pages for genes associated with the disease that have been identified by several groups active in the field, and make these easily discoverable by use of additional disease ontologies. We will provide graphical views of protein expression data and links to data on orthologous genes/proteins in model organism species. We will use text mining to supplement the results of expert literature curation and determine ways in which the research community can directly contribute to UniProt records.

"Reconstructing the temporal landscape of gene regulation in aging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The circadian rhythm orchestrates a vast repertoire of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes with a 24-hour period. A clock circuit, driven by the oscillatory activation and repression of a set of core clock genes, is present in every cell and regulates the expression of nearly half the genome across all tissues. Abundant epi- demiological evidence links circadian regulation to human health. In particular, sleep and circadian disruption is associated with neurodegeneration, where it is thought to be both a consequence and a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the most common form of dementia in the elderly, AD is rapidly becoming a public health cri- sis, affecting an estimated 5.5M people in the United States (24M world-wide) and is expected to double over the next 20 years. Addressing this crisis requires a deep understanding of disease mechanisms and the identiﬁcation of diagnostic/therapeutic targets. A wealth of existing transcriptomic data, coupled with the development of sophisticated computational tools for temporal reconstruction and analysis, provide an exciting opportunity to identify dysregulation in oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and AD.  We propose to develop novel computational strategies to decipher the oscillatory patterns of gene expression using existing untimed transcriptomic datasets; and to apply them to existing data from studies of AD to identify dysregulation in the oscillatory patterns associated with AD. Our methods address a number of analytical chal- lenges, including the need to reconstruct temporal information from untimed samples; ensuring generalizability and accuracy across different transcriptomic proﬁling technologies; addressing the fact that untimed samples may not span the full day; and identifying changes in complex, non-sinusoidal rhythms. Together, these studies will reveal oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and Alzheimers disease, and will provide innovative new methods for the circadian analysis of untimed data that can be applied to other phenotypes. NARRATIVE The circadian rhythm orchestrates critical physiological functions at the molecular, cell, and organismal levels. While degradation of the circadian rhythm is known to be associated with aging and believed to contribute to Alzheimer's and other age-related diseases, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly characterized. This project aims to develop and apply powerful computational tools to investigate circadian patterns of gene activity in older adults, with the goal of enabling personalized circadian medicine for an aging population.",Reconstructing the temporal landscape of gene regulation in aging,10046159,R01AG068579,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Older Population', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Repression', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Systems Theory', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'new technology', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,378976,0.07599084073214651
"Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade Abstract Enormous effort has been made to uncover the series of changes in biomarkers along Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiological pathway and its later clinical manifestations. The most influential hypothetical model proposed by Jack and colleagues has greatly shaped AD research in the past decade, whereas it remains a hypothesis to be validated. The key challenge in the validation is the fact that AD pathophysiological process is not directly observable. The temporal biomarker profile is therefore usually examined against discrete clinical diagnoses, estimated years from clinical symptom onset or test score of cognitive impairment – neither is a good measure of the AD pathogenic process, but merely clinical consequences that have been shown to vary greatly among individuals and also to be affected by other diseases. In this proposal, we will tackle this topic in the following aspects. (1) We will develop appropriate statistical models that directly address the unobservable nature of the AD pathophysiological process and therefore provide the foundation to operationalize and validate hypothetical AD biomarker models. (2) We will utilize data across multiple AD database to provide data-based evidence on the AD biomarker cascade and its clinical manifestations, as well as inform the link between the newly proposed biological AD definition in the 2018 NIA-AA research guideline and the current syndromic AD definition. (3) We will develop a statistical framework for dynamic prediction of AD pathophysiological progression trajectory and its clinical manifestations based on the history of a patient’s biomarker profiles. (4) We will develop a web-based application that allows for expedited delivery of statistical learning into practice. Although the scientific questions are focused, the proposed statistical model is applicable to many observational studies with longitudinal, multivariate biomarker measures to capture an unobservable structure, such as in aging or mental health studies. Narrative The project develops appropriate statistical methodologies to evaluate temporal biomarker changes along a pathophysiological process that cannot be directly observed, bridge the gap between a rigorous evaluation and the practical constraints using existing data sources, and attempt to provide individualized prediction of a patient’s future progression trajectory and associated clinical manifestations based on the biomarker history of this patient. Methods are motivated by the need to understand the series of changes in biomarkers along the Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiological pathway during the asymptotic stage and its later clinical manifestations, but can be applied to many biomarker studies where the outcome is not directly observable, such as in aging or mental health studies.",Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade,10026353,R01AG068002,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention Trial', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sigmoid colon', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'multiple data sources', 'neuroimaging', 'patient biomarkers', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'semiparametric', 'software development', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'therapeutic development', 'user-friendly']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,409375,0.21716031180321874
"Combine Genomics and Symptoms Data Driven Models to Discover Synergistic Combinatory Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary In 2018, an estimated 5.7 million people have Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or a related dementia in the U.S., with related healthcare costs of ~$277 billion1. However, there is no cure yet for AD. One major challenge is that the complicated pathogenesis of AD remains unclear, though >42 genes/loci have been associated with AD2,3. These genes are not actionable or druggable yet for AD management2. Over 240 drugs were tested in clinical trials but no new drugs have been approved for AD since 20031,4. The failure of these drugs is likely, in part, due to the limited efficacy of single agents to treat AD that is a genetically complex, multifactorial disease2, i.e., robust molecular signaling crosstalks among multi-pathways2,5,6,7,8,9, as well as complicated niche factors, e.g., oxidative stress10,11,12,13, and inflammation14,15,16, leading to neuron de-generation. Therefore, combination therapies eliminating these niche factors, and disrupting the dysfunctional signaling pathways and cross-talks, can be more effective than single agents for in AD patients. The goal of this study is to fill the gap of accelerating repositioning of combination therapies for AD using following novel genomics and symptoms data-driven models seamlessly integrating well designed iPSC Aβ AD models. The Washington University Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Knight-ADRC), has generated comprehensive omics data for a large group of AD samples. We propose to (in Aim 1) uncover core signaling pathways and crosstalks of ApoE4 genotype-specific AD subtypes via a novel signaling convergence network model, and consequently to discover synergistic Signaling Network Disruption drug combinations (SNDdc) via novel drug prediction models integrating heterogenous pharmacogenomics datasets. On the other hand, we propose to (in Aim 2) discover potential Neuron Protective drug combinations (NPdc) using electronic health records (EHR), available in BJC HealthCare system (includes 14 academic and community hospitals in Missouri and Illinois), of patients with brain injury diseases, especially Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), via a novel high-order poly-pharmacy efficacy and safety model. We hypothesize that acute brain damage in TBI will share the aforementioned key AD-related niche factors. Also because TBI patients often require multiple drugs daily (high-order poly-pharmacy use), we propose that TBI provides an appropriate model to study synergy and interactions of combination therapies that can ameliorate acute brain injury, and thus suggest potentially neuron protective combinations. Combinations in SNDdc and NPdc provide candidates for novel and effective AD treatment. To filter the false positives, we will (in Aim 3) utilize pooled CRISPR functional genomics and iPSC neurodegeneration model to identify key signaling genes, and validate combination therapies with ApoE4 genotype-specific iPSC Aβ models. Our new models represent a potential breakthrough in AD combination therapies discovery.

"CRCNS: Investigating Brain Dynamics through the Lens of Statistical Mechanics Synaptic dysfunction has been hypothesized to be one of the earliest brain changes in Alzheimer’s  disease (AD), leading to hyper-excitation in neuronal circuits. However, network changes related to age  and sex tend to overlap with disease neuropathology, increasing the difficulty of separating  disease-specific alterations from those related to normal aging trajectories in males and females. Indeed,  AD disproportionately affects women, who comprise two thirds of all persons diagnosed with AD dementia.  Leveraging resting state fMRI connectome and diffusion MRI-derived structural connectome, we will use a  novel hybrid resting-state structural connectome (rs-SC) to study excitation-inhibition balance. Recently,  using a group of cognitively normal APOE-ε4 carriers and age/gender matched non-carriers we  demonstrated a sex-by-age-by-phenotype interaction, with significant hyperexcitation with increasing age  only observable in women, but not in men. Further, hyperexcitation in female carriers began to exhibit at  age 50 in the anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal lobe regions, and the degree of  hyperexcitation is linked to compensatory recruitment of neuronal resources during a spatial learning  memory task.  In this proposal, we will characterize 1) sex-specific normative trajectories of excitation-inhibition balance  using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data, and 2) altered excitation-inhibition balance in  abnormal aging using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, as well as 3) further  test and validate our hyperexcitation framework in longitudinal mouse models of AD. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  In this proposal, we will develop novel computational tools to characterize hyper-excitation patterns in  aging and Alzheimer's Disease and validate our hyperexcitation framework on human data (ADNI and  HCP) as well as longitudinal mouse models of AD. This will significantly improve our understanding of AD  and potentially accelerate the discovery of more robust non-invasive imaging biomarkers of AD. n/a",CRCNS: Investigating Brain Dynamics through the Lens of Statistical Mechanics,10155730,R01AG071243,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anterior', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Instruction', 'Knock-in', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase Transition', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Property', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Woman', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease classification', 'ferrite', 'genetic risk factor', 'human data', 'improved', 'lens', 'male', 'men', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropathology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'recruit', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,302871,0.19230646119488456
"CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder. Inflammatory changes in the brain are thought to represent key processes in the onset and progression of AD, but it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation confers neuroprotection, accelerated degeneration, or possibly both. Such an understanding in living humans is critical if we are to begin clinical trials using the array of FDA-approved immunomodulatory drugs in the future. We propose that complement- mediated neuroinflammation is protective in the early AD stages, while suppression of complement activities is accompanied by the development of greater cognitive deficits and faster cognitive decline. Our preliminary data from multiple cohorts support this hypothesis by showing 1) reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement-related markers occur in the dementia stage but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD; 2) reduced CSF complement-related markers and elevated CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with faster decline in AD; and 3) CSF inflammatory protein alterations reveal networks of cellular and protein regulations. In the In the current application, we will build on the association between complement related proteins and rates of cognitive decline in AD to identify associated changes in soluble CSF cytokines and chemokines, differential inflammatory cell type regulation, and imaging correlates of neuroinflammation. This application takes advantage of our group’s strengths in performing CSF cytokine measurements, CSF immunophenotyping, molecular imaging of neuroinflammation through positron emission tomography (PET) and iron-enhanced MRI, and network analysis through a novel biochemical-bioinformatics pipeline. We will directly identify individual and networks of soluble CSF cytokines that accompany the transition from the MCI to the dementia stage of AD, correlate the complement and other altered pathways with microglial activation through two modern PET tracers (11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA), and measure changes in individual T helper cell (type 1, 2, 17) and non-T cell populations. This application represents the first attempt to correlate, at the individual level and at the group level, CSF and imaging measures of neuroinflammation. If successful, this application will advance the understanding of neuroinflammation in AD through parallel approaches, form the basis of a new biomarker panel (and algorithm) to diagnose AD through a combination of degenerative and inflammatory markers, and accelerate the target identification of future therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system in AD. Brain inflammation is a key event in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but it is not clear whether it is harmful, protective, or both. The current proposal aims to confirm our finding that a switch from the protective to harmful type of inflammation predicts more severe symptoms and faster progression in Alzheimer’s disease, and we can identify people with the protective and harmful inflammation by studying the cerebrospinal fluid (circulating proteins and cells) and brain imaging (PET and MRI scans).","CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease",9941020,R01AG054046,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement Suppression', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Encephalitis', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fractalkine', 'Future', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging ligands', 'Immune system', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-7', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Phagocytes', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker panel', 'brain dysfunction', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'demographics', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'iron oxide', 'macrophage', 'migration', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'neuroprotection', 'novel']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,801363,0.20402257234873727

"Leveraging Existing Data and Analytic Methods for Health Disparities Research Related to Aging and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) Abstract Two of a series of in-person workshops in 2020-2022 will be hosted at Duke to provide new knowledge on how existing and recently developed analytic methods can be used for detailed population and clinical data analysis in order to make progress in understanding the causes and mechanisms of health-related disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), related dementias (ADRD), and other prominent age-related diseases. The long- term goal of the series is to provide a resource focused on diffusing methodological know-how in terms of demonstrating the capabilities of newly developed methodologies, expanding on the rigor and range of application of well-established and familiar methods, promoting correct use of big health data both from a methodological and ethical prospective as well as providing a forum for experts and newcomers interested in health disparities and age-related diseases to discuss their ideas and promote their research. The pilot Duke- NIA workshop of the series held in February 2019 at Duke University was successful in drawing broad scientific interest to the topic and generated the background for the current proposal. The focus of the first workshop (planned in Winter 2020/2021) will be on demonstrating how studies using established administrative health data resources such as the Medicare claims database combined with innovative analytic approaches such as partitioning analyses, time-series based methods of projection/forecasting, and stochastic process models can be used to uncover previously overlooked and/or understudied aspects in this area of research. Specific topics to be discussed will include: i) disparities in risks and survival of AD/ADRD and other age- related diseases; ii) forecasting approaches for prevalence and mortality of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; iii) analysis of Medicare and other administrative claim-based data. The focus of the second workshop (planned in Winter 2021/2022) will extend this to include the health records data routinely collected in hospitals or University medical centers (e.g., the Duke Clinical Data Warehouse) and demonstrate how well- established and new analytic methods can be rigorously applied to such data to contribute to identifying the causes of persistent health disparities between specific groups of the U.S. population and narrowly defined patient strata. Specific topics will be expanded to include: i) analytic approaches to identify and quantify the contribution of treatment-related and medical care access-related factors to disparities in outcomes of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; ii) comorbidity, multimorbidity, treatment-related, social and genetic factors as sources of disparities in health outcomes of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; iii) forecasting of health outcomes and approaches for analyses of potential health interventions. The proceedings will be streamed live on the workshop website and presentations will be freely available in text and video form after the fact. Narrative Our objective is to host two in-person workshops in 2020-2021, in which research findings and evidence-based information and analytic tools for analyses of health-related disparities in Alzheimer’s disease, related dementias and other prominent age-related diseases are discussed. Specific Aims to be addressed in this project will be focused on increased collaboration and partnership in an interdisciplinary research community focused on analytic methods for large-scale population and clinic-related data, constructing a bridge between independent research subgroups, and the identification of ways to achieve synergistic effects in multidisciplinary research by combining innovative approaches developed across different research groups. Ultimately, our long-term goal is to diffuse the active use of advanced analytic methods for analyses of existing big health population datasets in health disparity research.",Leveraging Existing Data and Analytic Methods for Health Disparities Research Related to Aging and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD),10070960,R13AG069381,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Universities', 'advanced analytics', 'age related', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical data warehouse', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'dementia risk', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health record', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'news', 'population health', 'prospective', 'social', 'web site']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R13,2020,50000,0.08471011261784307
"3D Reconstruction and Analysis of Alzheimer's Patient Biopsy Samples to Map and Quantify Hallmarks of Pathogenesis and Vulnerability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This project will expand the acquisition, reconstruction, analysis, and dissemination of 3D electron microscopic (3D EM) reference data, disclosing key ultrastructural details preserved within a remarkable collection of legacy biopsy brain samples from patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). These samples were originally collected, characterized and archived by neuropathologists R.D. Terry and N. Gonatas (at A. Einstein in the 1960’s), with later samples taken as part of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug infusion study involving S. Mirra (at Emory in the 1980’s). They were re-examined by Ellisman, Masliah, Terry, and Mirra in the 1980s, using early 3D EM methods, and were found to manifest excellent preservation of ultrastructure, showing paired helical filaments (PHF) and amyloid accumulations as well as modifications to subcellular organelles and cytoskeletons of the cell bodies, axonal and dendritic processes. Here, we will exploit recent advances in high throughput, automated 3D EM to massively scale the examination of these precious samples, reconstructing 100s of brain cells with and without PHF, tracking axons (and mapping glia and synapses) through much greater brain volumes than was feasible previously. Our goal is to target areas associated with both plaques and tangles, attending to locations where existing findings suggest cell and network vulnerability and contain molecular interactions suspected by some to underlie the initiation and progression of AD. Supporting investigations into the progression of soma/dendritic degeneration, we will target cells operationally defined to represent a progression of neuronal decline as seen in AD; determining the volume fraction of PHF in the cytoplasm as a practical staging measure and linking this to the characterization of quantitative changes in the microstructure of major subcellular constituents. Likewise, we will analyze the progression of axonal degeneration in and near plaques as data obtained suggests that axons may become dystrophic before their parent cell bodies and their dendrites degenerate. NARRATIVE This project will expand the acquisition, reconstruction, analysis, and immediate dissemination of 3D electron microscopic (3D EM) reference data, disclosing key ultrastructural details preserved within a remarkable collection of legacy biopsy brain samples from patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Our focus is to examine regions of acute interest, based on our own observations and insight offered from current AD literature, at a resolution sufficient to quantitatively assess suggested markers of AD-associated pathogenesis, link to biochemical data on molecular structures from studies on humans and mouse models of AD, and motivate future hypothesis driven research.",3D Reconstruction and Analysis of Alzheimer's Patient Biopsy Samples to Map and Quantify Hallmarks of Pathogenesis and Vulnerability,9867232,R01AG065549,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Cytoplasm', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Electrons', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Human', 'Infusion procedures', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microtubules', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurites', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Synapses', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axonal degeneration', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cellular imaging', 'cellular targeting', 'convolutional neural network', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'electron tomography', 'human model', 'image archival system', 'imaging Segmentation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'open source', 'paired helical filament', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'web portal']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,746606,0.15525713036669633
"UK-ADRC neuroimaging supplement: LATE and PART PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – OVERALL (Adapted from Abstract of parent grant, UK-ADC) This is a proposal for a University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (UK-ADRC) neuroimaging supplement. This purpose of the supplement is to provide neuroimaging data on the UK-ADRC’s deeply phenotyped clinical cohort to the NIH’s recently funded initiative, Standardized Centralized Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Neuroimaging (SCAN). In addition, a secondary purpose of this supplement is to identify neuroimaging correlates of two AD-mimics: limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and primary age-related tauopathy (PART). The UK-ADRC is an experienced and collaborative ADRC originally funded in 1985. Our principal mission is to serve as the focal point for all AD-related activities at UK and this region of the United States, by providing an environment and core resources that catalyze innovative research, outreach, education, and clinical programs. Our signature resources include: 1) a cognitively normal group of ~500 subjects followed longitudinally, with all committed to brain autopsy upon death; 2) a strong program in clinical-neuropathological correlations and short postmortem interval autopsies; 3) an established program studying preclinical biomarkers of AD using neuroimaging and biofluids; 4) an integrated centralized database and innovative biostatistical expertise to characterize clinical and biological transitions; and 5) a successful and close partnership with the African-American community and increased participation of underrepresented individuals in our longitudinal cohort and ADRC-affiliated research studies and clinical trials. The overall scientific emphasis of the UK-ADRC continues to be on our interrelated themes: Transitions & Translation. Our well-characterized, longitudinal cohort and historically strong neuropathology program focused on normal aging, preclinical disease states and early cognitive transitions have been central to our success in defining early pathogenic mechanisms underlying the transitions from normal cognitive aging to impairment. The depth of expertise and collaborative nature of our investigators have also resulted in substantial progress on translation of that knowledge into new targets and novel therapeutic strategies. The UK-ADRC provides an infrastructure and environment that focuses on these integrated themes and advances AD research, education, outreach, and clinical programs through highly interactive and effective components: Administrative Core, Clinical Core, Data Management and Statistics Core, Neuropathology Core, Outreach and Recruitment Core, Biomarker Core, and Research Education Component. The UK-ADRC will make resources from these Cores available to support the success of this ADRC neuroimaging supplement. NARRATIVE This supplement will fill a critical gap in the field by focusing on the development of neuroimaging biomarkers of two common AD mimics: LATE and PART. By imaging subjects who are A negative and without significant cerebrovascular disease, we will identify MRI patterns characteristic of these AD mimics. We will share the UK SCAN neuroimaging data, combined with our deep clinical, biofluid, and genetic phenotyping of these longitudinally followed subjects, to stimulate additional research on AD mimics across the ADRC network.",UK-ADRC neuroimaging supplement: LATE and PART,10170755,P30AG028383,"['Address', 'African American', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Amyloid', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Kentucky', 'Letters', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mission', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Tauopathies', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'central database', 'clinical development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data management', 'education research', 'experience', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human old age (65+)', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'normal aging', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'parent grant', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'recruit', 'research study', 'statistics', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'vascular cognitive impairment and dementia', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,P30,2020,367200,0.12324744755006493
"MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but has no effective prevention or treatment. The brain proteome, ascertained in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have proven to be a rich source of information, reflecting Aβ plaques deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal injury and inflammation, and have helped the enrollment of participants in clinical trials. Still, additional non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers are critical for the early detection, disease intervention and monitoring. Novel biomarkers may also help identify and characterize the additional aspects of AD, such as rate of progression and age at onset. Although genetic studies have focused on the identification of variants associated with risk through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome and exome sequencing projects, the genetic factors modulating these additional aspects of AD are less investigated. The current proposal focuses on these understudied aspects of disease etiology, namely the role of common and rare genetic variation on quantitative diagnostic and prognostic endophenotypes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will develop a unique resource – the proteome ascertained in a plasma, CSF and brain for a large number of samples – that will allow us to leverage unbiased approaches to reveal novel biomarkers and endophenotypes associated with AD and complex traits. We will utilize Mendelian Randomization to identify causal proteins involved in AD and extend our studies to other complex traits. We will use GWAS, exome-chip, whole-exome and whole-genome sequences to identify single variants, genes and pathways associated with plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain protein levels of AD biomarkers. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with devastating personal, familial, societal and economical burdens, and there is currently no effective means of prevention or treatment. If successful, our research will reveal novel intermediate traits and genetic variants involved in AD and other complex traits, potentially leading to prospective therapeutic targets, and will also provide guidelines for accurate and practical assessments of AD status, which will be invaluable for evaluations of effectiveness of experimental treatments in clinical trials.",MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS,9967958,R01AG057777,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'TREM2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical risk', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'protein profiling', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,767958,0.2385986579292694
"Forecasting response to pharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's and related dementias based on medical record and brain MRI characteristics: A precision medicine approach Summary: Toward our long-term goal of developing a methodological framework for predicting response to pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias in clinical settings, we propose a proof of concept study to investigate clinical and neuroanatomical features related to response to treatment with two classes of medications that are currently in wide use: cholinesterase inhibitors (CEI) and serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). These treatments are focused on alleviating symptoms and extending patient autonomy. CEIs have shown efficacy in improving activities of daily living and are more cost- effective than supportive care. SSRIs are a first choice for the pharmacological treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) that affect ~97% of AD patients. However, response to CEI/SSRI varies between patients, with only half responding to these drugs. Moreover, one-third of patients discontinue therapy because of adverse effects. Given the AD pandemic, with 16M patients expected in the US by 2050, the targeted use of CEI/SSRI to patients who will benefit from treatment is a public health priority. Although predictive markers to identify those who will respond to CEI/SSRI have been highly anticipated, there, as yet, no established such markers. Several clinical or genetic markers have been proposed as response predictors, but none have been validated. Studying neuroanatomical features of the brain, which can be detected through MRI (= brain phenotype), has succeeded in the identification of subgroups of AD related to clinical, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric characteristics. However, little is known about whether brain phenotyping predicts response to pharmacological interventions. Available results from pilot studies with small and highly selected samples point to the necessity of studying larger, more inclusive cohorts. Since individualized prediction cannot be made from a single feature, as each feature weakly correlates with outcomes, we hypothesize that patient stratification that combines brain phenotype and clinical characteristics, will be highly accurate at individualized prediction. In this study, we will utilize pre-existing resources to identify brain phenotypes and clinical features that might predict response to CEI/SSRI treatment. First, data extracted from a large pool of electronic medical records acquired through clinical practice will be used to identify brain phenotypes and clinical features related to a response to CEI/SSRI. Second, our automated brain features extraction pipeline, which is robust to the great heterogeneity in diseased brains will be used to quantify brain phenotypes. We propose Aim 1 to assess the feasibility of brain phenotyping and Aim 2 to assess the feasibility of a supervised clustering approach based on brain phenotype and clinical features, in predicting a response to CEI/SSRI. The proposed feasibility testing based on analysis of data from a real world clinical care patient cohort will lay the foundation for future studies and provides a framework to identify subgroups of AD who will benefit from specific medications, including those that become available in the future, for safe and effective treatment. Narrative Toward our long-term goal of developing a methodological framework for predicting response to pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias in clinical settings, we propose a proof of concept study to investigate clinical and neuroanatomical features related to response to treatment with two classes of medications that are currently in wide use: cholinesterase inhibitors (CEI) and serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). We will combine a large number of medical records acquired through clinical practice with our cutting-edge high-throughput brain imaging analysis methods to identify subgroups of AD with similar brain and clinical phenotypes who will have better responses to CEI or SSRI treatment. The proposed feasibility testing based on retrospective data analysis provides a framework to identify subgroups of AD patients who may benefit from medications, including those that may become available in the future.",Forecasting response to pharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's and related dementias based on medical record and brain MRI characteristics: A precision medicine approach,10109413,R21AG070404,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Bradycardia', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Cognitive', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Convulsions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Rhabdomyolysis', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'basal forebrain', 'base', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'effective therapy', 'feature extraction', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large datasets', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'pandemic disease', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'public health priorities', 'reduce symptoms', 'response', 'reuptake', 'side effect', 'supervised learning', 'treatment response']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,450313,0.09610857290501201
"AMYLOIDOGENIC INDUCTION OF CELLULAR SENESCENCE IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular senescence, one of the major hallmarks of aging, describes the sudden inability for cells to divide. Senescent cells often accumulate with age, in response to physical and chemical stressors (genomic instability, telomere attrition, irradiation, etc.), though the overlap between these stressors and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is currently unknown. In-vitro experiments of senescence often utilize contrived stressors such as hydrogen peroxide or radiation, that may not be physiologically relevant for age-related diseases such as AD. Furthermore, the senescence phenotypes observed in vitro are likely not complete models for what is occurring in dynamic biological systems.  Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Abo), an important hallmark in AD, have been shown to potently induce senescence in a variety of brain cell types and environments, in contrast to fibrillar Ab. Abo is thought to bind membrane proteins and subsequently signal downstream aggregation of related amyloids such as tau. In fact, the presence of endogenous Abo is one of the strongest indicators of disease severity in AD models and organisms, suggesting a link between AD and cellular senescence that is only beginning to be explored.  In order to study this association, we propose to combine gold-standard techniques and single-cell omics data in order to define heterogenous genetic and epigenetic signatures of senescence that are distinctly a function of their induction type. Doing so will also produce robust signatures and biomarkers of senescence in brain cells that can be utilized for the pathological phenotyping of human tissues. These measures will also allow for the comparison of disparate senescent behaviors to help identify lab-derived amyloids that best resemble patient-derived constructs. We will evaluate multiple lab-derived Abo constructs, including those stabilized from lipids located in predominantly diseased regions of the brain. Observations would be synergistically coupled with solution biophysics experiments and molecular modeling, providing analogous structural data for each inducer type. Taken together, these measurements will uniquely profile senescence in brain cells, define the degree of overlap between endogenous senescence inducers and those reconstituted in the lab, and highlighting how AD risk is modulated by cellular senescence. PROJECT NARRATIVE One of the most well-known hallmarks of human aging is cellular senescence; however the relationship between senescence and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is poorly understood. We hypothesize that soluble amyloids, but not fibrils or plaques, link the induction of cellular senescence in brain cells to neurodegeneration, yet it remains unclear which soluble amyloids modulate these behaviors. In order to test this hypothesis, we will utilize a combination of genetic and epigenetic measurements to compare the ability of synthetic and patient-derived amyloids to induce senescence in brain cells, thereby deducing the molecular and epigenetic overlap between senescence and AD.",AMYLOIDOGENIC INDUCTION OF CELLULAR SENESCENCE IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE,10044065,R01AG068285,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Aging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Coupled', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fibroblasts', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Instability', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Radiation', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Solubility', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'abeta oligomer', 'age related', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker development', 'biophysical techniques', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'disorder control', 'experimental study', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'irradiation', 'molecular modeling', 'molecular phenotype', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'oligodendrocyte progenitor', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'senescence', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cells', 'stressor', 'structured data', 'tau Proteins', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,412000,0.14819047407287614
"Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias ABSTRACT Our healthcare system faces larger numbers of individuals with early to late Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders requiring anesthesia associated procedures for serious health related conditions (e.g., cardiac), screening (e.g., colonoscopy), or quality of life improvement (e.g., joint replacement). Despite evidence that preoperative cognitive status is a risk factor for negative post-operative outcomes, there is a scarcity of research addressing perioperative cognitive-biomarker-anesthesia interactions, and evidence based anesthesia-surgical practices for patients with prodromal or diagnosed dementias. The K07 applicant- an NIH funded independent investigator and board certified neuropsychologist with expertise in the cognitive sequelae and associated neuroimaging markers of AD, vascular dementia, and other neurodegenerative disorders, and cognitive and neuroimaging predictors of perioperative cognitive complications and delirium. The applicant (with support of the institution) is proposing a Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for AD and related dementia. The purpose– to promote institutional and community awareness of cognition and memory in older adults electing surgical procedures with anesthesia, intensify collaborations on AD biomarkers- anesthesia interactions, and promote translation of research findings to clinical care. The applicant will complete advanced leadership training and three programmatic aims. Aim 1- convene a multidisciplinary advisory team to establish four integrated PeCAN research cores targeting AD and related dementia perioperative research. Cores include a Cognitive-Clinical Core, a Neuroimaging Core, a Biomarker Core, and a Data Science Core. Aim 2- enhance defined and supportive pathways to the PeCAN cores so that early stage investigators can efficiently initiate and complete perioperative-neurodegenerative research. The applicant will integrate pathways between multiple institutional resources including NIH funded 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute, the University of Florida (UF) Institute on Aging Pepper Center, and the UF Fixel Center for Neurological Diseases. Aim 3- promote the emergence of highly trained scientists and educators for innovative team science addressing perioperative neuronal risk and mechanisms for protection. Methods will involve implementation of a certificate program, interdisciplinary team-science research opportunities, and pilot funding supported through this grant and institutional matching funds. Trainees will initially include appropriate predoctoral T32 trainees, neuropsychology fellows, and anesthesiology fellows. Milestones- annual analyses of programmatic strengths/weaknesses, multidisciplinary proposal submissions, and evidence of trainee success with perioperative research for AD and related dementias.  Narrative Despite expected exponential increases in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and an overabundance of research indicating that preoperative cognitive impairment is a major risk factor for negative post-operative outcome, we know very little of AD cognitive, biomarker, and anesthesia/surgical interactions and have little to no evidence-based perioperative medical care strategies for AD patients. Via the K07 mechanism and institutional support, the applicant will leverage novel perioperative clinical and state-of-the-art institutional facilities to develop an institutional wide research and training program addressing these problems. The proposed program will result in improved awareness of cognition and memory status in older adults prior to surgical procedures with anesthesia, intensify collaborative research addressing brain-behavior-anesthesia interactions through both animal and human research approaches, and promote translation of research findings to clinical care.",Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias,9950445,K07AG066813,"['Academic/Teacher Award', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animals', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Capsicum', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Delirium', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Face', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pecans', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Ventricular', 'White Matter Disease', 'brain behavior', 'brain health', 'certificate program', 'clinical care', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'curriculum development', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal human study', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'older patient', 'postoperative delirium', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'symposium', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K07,2020,162000,0.12770809891146193
"Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a prospective, community-based 3-generational study that enrolled participants between ages 20-50 and has examined them every 2-4 years to collect extensive lifestyle, vascular, biomarker data; 9300 have GWAS. Embedded in this cohort are 1036 multigenerational families. Surveillance for AD dementia (and MCI) has been ongoing for over 4 decades. We have identified 1421 incident AD, 1767 MCI, enrolled 800+ in a brain donation program, obtained 7000+ 1.5T brain MRI, and repeated, detailed neuropsychological assessments. We have recently obtained extensive omics in ~6000 (gene expression, methylation, miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics) and genomics (50X whole genome sequences [WGS] in 4197 with pedigree-based imputation to 6554) through the NHLBI funded SABRe CVD (omics) and TOPMed (WGS) programs. We seek to leverage these rich resources (>$25 million). We propose these specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain temporal trends in clinical AD dementia in the FHS cohorts. The age-specific incidence of dementia has declined over the past 4 decades among FHS participants (in press). However, the reasons for this decline remain unclear. We thus propose to continue tracking temporal trends in AD dementia and MCI through intensive surveillance, and verifying diagnoses at autopsy. We hypothesize that better education, treatment of some vascular factors and protective lifestyle changes (diet, activity, social engagement) may partially explain these trends. AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention. Whereas the total number of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages, we have 4 decades of Framingham data suggesting that the risk at any given age is declining. We plan to study the reasons for this hopeful trend in detail through continuing our surveillance for dementia and cognitive impairment, collecting cutting edge brain imaging (amyloid and tau-PET, volumes, connectivity and perfusion on MRI) in the dementia-free (preclinical AD), and using sophisticated analysis of very extensive genetic and omic data already collected on Framingham subjects. This could help us better understand AD trends and biology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.   ","Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts",9988992,R01AG054076,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug Targeting', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Social Network', 'Spin Labels', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time trend', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'base', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'family burden', 'genetic pedigree', 'genome wide association study', 'good diet', 'grandparent', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'personalized risk prediction', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'social engagement', 'tau Proteins', 'tractography', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend', 'vascular factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2020,1992571,0.26700957105653655
"Cutaneous Pathogen-Specific Tissue Resident Memory T Cells in Human Aging Project Summary Several lines of evidence link infections to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This one-year Supplement application focuses on the potential role of HSV-1 infection. About 70% of older adults are HSV-1 infected. The parent R01 concerns the viral pathogen VZV, shingles, and aging, and is eligible for the Supplement as does not concern Alzheimer’s Disease. The Supplement is related to the parent R01 because HSV-1 has a similar pathogenesis, sequence, and antigenic structure to VZV, and also because aging is a risk factor for both shingles and Alzheimer’s Disease. The Supplement Premise is that the fine specificity of T cells recovered from anatomically and clinically relevant specimens from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease subjects can be used as a biomarker probe possible microbial driver of these disorders. Linkages between HSV-1 and AD include epidemiologic association of AD with HSV-1 seropositivity in APOE4(+) persons, detection of HSV-1 from AD tissues, the ability of HSV-1 to trigger amyloidogenesis in vitro, and interactions between HSV-1 cerebral infection, human APOE genotype, and dementia-like phenotypes in murine models. The Investigative team includes experts in HSV-1 T cell biology, single cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCRseq) and TCR bioinformatic analysis, advanced histologic of human nervous system tissue, and the clinical study of Mild Cognitive Impairment subjects. The study is home- based at the University of Washington (UW) including the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), with one domestic and one international collaborative site. Importantly, ongoing NIH grant/subcontract relationships exist between UW and each site and the PI has published multiple recent papers with the Co-Investigators at each site. Aim 1 recovers CSF and matched blood from HSV-1-seropositive persons with MCI and uses wet-lab and TCRseq dry/wet methods to determine if HSV-1-specific T cells are enriched in CSF compared to blood. Aim 2 recovers single T cells from curated AD autopsy tissues from the Netherlands Brain Bank and similarly measures HSV-1 specificity. Together, the Aims leverage the extreme sensitivity and memory characteristics of T cell immunity to examine the hypothesis that HSV-1 is involved in Alzheimer’s Disease Project Narrative Because several lines of evidence indicate that HSV-1 infection may be a cofactor for the development of these disorders, the investigative team proposes use of sensitive detection methods to determine if anatomically relevant specimens such as spinal fluid and brain tissue show evidence of immune responses to HSV-1. The Relevance is that antiviral medications and vaccines may be rational for prevention or even therapy if we can strongly link HSV-1 with the pathogenesis of these disabling conditions",Cutaneous Pathogen-Specific Tissue Resident Memory T Cells in Human Aging,10118463,R01AG064800,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amino Acids', 'Anatomy', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Bar Codes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Herpes Labialis', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Herpesviridae', 'Herpesviridae Infections', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 2', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Human Herpesvirus 6', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunooncology', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'International', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Netherlands', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peptide Receptor', 'Peptides', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Simplexvirus', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Structure of trigeminal ganglion', 'T memory cell', 'T-Cell Immunologic Specificity', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus Latency', 'Washington', 'amyloidogenesis', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'chronic infection', 'clinically relevant', 'cofactor', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'human pathogen', 'in silico', 'microbial', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mouse model', 'neurotropic', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'reactivation from latency', 'receptor expression', 'relating to nervous system', 'seropositive', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,396241,0.1245252622857408
"Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been identified as one of the strongest genetic determinants of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In general, the e4 allele is associated with reductions in neural protection and repair, increasing a carrier’s vulnerability to damage accumulated over his/her lifetime. Nevertheless, while the penetrance of ApoE e4 is relatively high, a significant proportion of e4 carriers will never develop AD. The overall goal of this project is to model interactions across multiple omics networks to identify the biological pathways involved in sporadic AD susceptibility versus resilience among high-risk individuals. The multifactorial nature of AD suggests that it may manifest as a result of complex interactions across the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Identifying the central networks involved in AD pathogenesis will require integrative Systems Biology approaches. The proposed research offers a new and innovative way to integrate networks—a dominant feature in biology—across multiple tissues and omics platforms, in order to identify innate and dynamic precursors of resilience to AD, among a high-risk population (e4+). Towards this goal, we will: (1) employ newly developed GWAS-based network analysis, to identify SNP networks that alter the association between ApoE e4 and cognitive decline/dementia; (2) generate DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from brain samples that we will analyze using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (3) generate proteomic data from brain and CSF samples that we will analyze using WGCNA to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (4) use advanced integromic network analysis to identify multi-omics and multi-tissue pathways and biological systems involved in AD resilience. The integration of multiple 'omics' data using systems biology will be crucial for unraveling the connections and interactions between various functional levels involved in complex diseases, such as AD. Overall, our proposed research will improve understanding of the complex biology underlying AD susceptibility. These studies have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets that could inform the development of future pharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing or slowing AD pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with the ApoE e4 genotype have a substantially increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this project is identify underlying biological interactions and networks that explain why some e4 carriers do not develop Alzheimer's disease, despite being high-risk. This research has the potential to uncover novel targets that can lead to the development of effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers,9949599,R01AG057912,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'religious order study', 'repaired', 'resilience', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,761295,0.238501232457794
"Center for Identification and Study of Individuals with Atypical Diabetes Mellitus (U54) Diabetes is traditionally classified in two broad categories: autoimmune Type 1 and obesity-related Type 2. Numerous phenotypically and etiologically distinct forms exist and are emerging, collectively termed “atypical diabetes” (AD), that do not fit into either category. We hypothesize that AD comprises a spectrum that includes numerous forms, both known (e.g, MODY/monogenic, Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults, Ketosis-Prone Diabetes) and unknown. We propose to establish the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE). The goals of CADRE are to (1) identify and define comprehensively the forms of AD; and (2) establish an extensive database and repository of biosamples from AD patients. Defining the forms of AD is challenging because the etiology of AD can range from a single gene variant to a highly complex mixture of genetics, epigenetics and environmental factors. To identify patients with AD, and then to define the forms, we will use a two-pronged approach. Approach (a) will use clustering analysis of genotypic and phenotypic data from diverse groups of patients with diabetes. We have recruited 15 domestic and international population cohorts with data on more than 33,000 patients with diabetes. Further, we have recruited six diabetes study clinics (Baylor College of Medicine [BCM], University of Washington [UW], Indiana University [IU], Emory University, University of Colorado, and SUNY Downstate) who will prospectively recruit patients. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation will facilitate recruitment from patient groups. The Administrative Core at BCM will work with cohorts and clinics to obtain data. The University of South Florida (USF) will filter data for AD and separate patients into phenotypically homogenous clusters that can be diagnosed based on genetic and clinical features unique to the cluster. Approach (b) will identify monogenic, oligogenic and mitochondrial forms of AD from patients enrolled in genetics registries (BCM) and a family study with genetic data (Botnia). The BCM registries include patients referred to the Undiagnosed Disease Network. All patients will undergo whole-exome and mitochondrial genome sequencing (Cores at BCM), single-nucleotide polymorphism variant analysis (Oxford), metabolomic analysis (Duke) and phenotypic analysis of C-peptide, adiponectin, proinsulin, islet autoantibodies, and serum insulin DNA levels (Cores at UW and IU). To establish the database and biorepository, we will invite patients with AD to participate in sample donation and longitudinal follow-up via the cohorts and clinics. Data and samples will be transferred to the Database and Biorepository Core at USF, with input and tracking implemented using the successful framework developed by USF for large multicenter trials. Data will be made available through the NIDDK and a CADRE website and samples will be made available through ancillary study application. Ongoing patient recruitment to expand the database and biorepository will occur through the study clinics and clinician referral through the CADRE website. Overall, CADRE will be built on a foundation of existing, successful core facilities and computational systems to create a lasting resource that will substantially advance AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE For many people with diabetes, their symptoms do not match those usually associated with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We will use medical and genetic information from a large number of patients with diabetes to find all the forms of “atypical diabetes,” so doctors can better diagnose and treat these patients. We will also make the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE) to keep data and samples from patients with atypical diabetes, so scientists can study these forms of diabetes.",Center for Identification and Study of Individuals with Atypical Diabetes Mellitus (U54),9988405,U54DK118638,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Ancillary Study', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diabetes', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'C-Peptide', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorado', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Complication', 'Core Facility', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunology', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Proinsulin', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'college', 'data sharing', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'diabetes mellitus genetics', 'diabetes pathogenesis', 'diverse data', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic registry', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'insight', 'islet', 'learning strategy', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'patient registry', 'phenotypic data', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'web site']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U54,2020,2500000,0.11885513467974429
