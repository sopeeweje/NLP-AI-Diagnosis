"CRCNS: Avian Model for Neural Activity Driven Speech Prostheses  Understanding the physical, computational, and theoretical bases of human vocal communication, speech, is crucial to improved comprehension of voice, speech and language diseases and disorders, and improving their diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Meeting this challenge requires knowledge of the neural and sensorimotor mechanisms of vocal motor control. Our project will directly investigate the neural and sensorimotor mechanisms involved in the production of complex, natural, vocal communication signals. Our results will directly enhance brain-computer interface technology for communication and will accelerate the development of prostheses and other assistive technologies for individuals with communications deficits due to injury or disease. We will develop a vocal prosthetic that directly translates neural signals in cortical sensorimotor and vocal-motor control regions into vocal communication signals output in real-time. Building on success using non-human primates for brain computer interfaces for general motor control, the prosthetic will be developed in songbirds, whose acoustically rich, learned vocalizations share many features with human speech. Because the songbird vocal apparatus is functipnally and anatomically similar to the human larynx, and the cortical regions that control it are closely analogous to speech motor-control areas of the human brain, songbirds offer an ideal model for the proposed studies. Beyond the application of our work to human voice and speech, development of the vocal prosthetic will enable novel speech-relevant studies in the songbird model that can reveal fundamental mechanisms of vocal learning and production. In the first stage of the project, we collect a large data set of simultaneously recorded neural activity and vocalizations. In stage two, we will apply machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to develop algorithms that map neural recordings to vocal output and enable us to estimate intended vocalizations directly from neural data. In stage three, we will develop computing infrastructure to run these algorithms in real-time, predicting intended vocalizations from neural activity as the animal is actively producing these vocalizations. In stage four, we will test the effectiveness of the prosthetic by substituting the bird's own vocalization with the output from our prosthetic system. Success will set the stage for testing of these technologies in humans and translation to multiple assistive devices. In addition to our research goals, the project will engage graduate, undergraduate, and high school students through the development of novel educational modules that introduce students to brain machine interface and multidisciplinary studies that span engineering and the basic sciences. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Developing a vocal prosthesis will directly enhance brain-computer interface technology for communication and accelerate the realization of prostheses and other assistive technologies for individuals with communications deficits due to injury or disease. The basic knowledge of the neural and sensorimotor mechanisms of vocal motor control acquired will impact understanding of multiple voice, speech, and language diseases and disorders. The techniques developed will enabling novel future studies of vocal production and development. n/a",CRCNS: Avian Model for Neural Activity Driven Speech Prostheses ,9916239,R01DC018446,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Interface', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Course Content', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Finches', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High School Outreach', 'High School Student', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Larynx', 'Learning Module', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Space Models', 'Speech', 'Speech Development', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Upper Extremity', 'Voice', 'Work', 'auditory feedback', 'base', 'bird song', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'data sharing', 'design', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional restoration', 'graduate student', 'hackathon', 'high school', 'human subject', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mind control', 'model development', 'motor control', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural model', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'signal processing', 'success', 'undergraduate student', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'web site']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,354676,0.12455385050818826
"Using Machine Learning to Mitigate Reverberation Effects in Cochlear Implants ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cochlear implants (CIs) provide hearing for over 200,000 recipients worldwide {NIDCD, 2011 #637}. These devices successfully provide high levels of speech understanding in quiet listening conditions; however, more challenging conditions degrade speech comprehension for CI recipients to a much greater degree than for normal hearing listeners {Kokkinakis, 2011 #673;Nelson, 2003 #302}. CI listeners are especially affected by reverberant conditions with even a small level of reverberation degrading comprehension to a greater degree than a large amount of steady-state noise {Hazrati, 2012 #674}. Thus, a method that mitigates the effects of reverberation has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for CI users. Previous attempts to solve the problem of speech in reverberation for cochlear implants have not been able to be implemented in real time. Our preliminary results suggest that successful mitigation of overlap masking can result in a substantial improvement in speech recognition even if self-masking is not mitigated and we have devised an approach that can be implemented in real time. In the proposed effort, we will first improve the classifier to detect reverberation based on our successful preliminary efforts. Next we will assess the mitigation algorithm, first in normal hearing listeners and then in listeners with cochlear implants. Finally, we will implement the algorithm in real time and again test it. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While cochlear implants (CIs) provide high levels of speech comprehension in quiet for over 200,000 profoundly deaf individuals worldwide, speech in quiet scenarios are rarely encountered outside of the home. The presence of noise or reverberation in the listening environment decreases speech comprehension for CI users much more rapidly than for normal-hearing listeners, and of these two conditions, reverberation has a greater negative impact. The proposed research aims to provide a robust reverberation mitigation algorithm for CI speech processors thereby improving the ability of CI users to interact in real-world listening environments.",Using Machine Learning to Mitigate Reverberation Effects in Cochlear Implants,9722203,R01DC014290,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Categories', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Comprehension', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Frequencies', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'deaf', 'improved', 'microphone', 'normal hearing', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'success']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,326399,0.2612885595838641
"Speech segregation to improve intelligility of reverberant-noisy speech Project Summary Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions, affecting 37.5 million Americans. Although signal amplification in modern hearing aids makes sound more audible to hearing impaired listeners, speech understanding in background interference remains the biggest challenge by hearing aid wearers. The proposed research seeks a monaural (one-microphone) solution to this challenge by developing supervised speech segregation based on deep learning. Unlike traditional speech enhancement, deep learning based speech segregation is driven by training data, and three components of a deep neural network (DNN) model are features, training targets, and network architectures. Recently, deep learning has achieved tremendous successes in a variety of real world applications. Our approach builds on the progress made in the PI's previous R01 project which demonstrated, for the first time, substantial speech intelligibility improvements for hearing-impaired listeners in noise. A main focus of the proposed work in this cycle is to combat room reverberation in addition to background interference. The proposed work is designed to achieve three specific aims. The first aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant-noisy speech for hearing- impaired listeners. To achieve this aim, we will train DNNs to perform time-frequency masking. The second aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant speech in the presence of competing speech. To achieve this aim, we will perform DNN training to estimate two ideal masks, one for the target talker and the other for the interfering talker. The third aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant speech in combined speech and nonspeech interference. To achieve this aim, we will develop a two-stage DNN model where the first stage will be trained to remove nonspeech interference and the second stage to remove interfering speech. Eight speech intelligibility experiments involving both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners will be conducted to systematically evaluate the developed system. The proposed project is expected to substantially close the speech intelligibility gap between hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners in daily conditions, with the ultimate goal of removing the gap altogether. Relevance A widely acknowledged deficit of hearing loss is reduced intelligibility of reverberant-noisy speech. How to improve speech intelligibility of hearing impaired listeners in everyday environments is a major technical challenge. This project directly addresses this challenge and the results from the project are expected to yield technical methods that can be translated to hearing prosthesis, potentially benefiting millions of individuals with hearing loss.",Speech segregation to improve intelligility of reverberant-noisy speech,9623341,R01DC012048,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microphone', 'network architecture', 'normal hearing', 'real world application', 'segregation', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech in noise', 'success', 'supervised learning']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,304865,0.301781823836354
"Using the RDoC Approach to Understand Thought Disorder: A Linguistic Corpus-Based Approach Thought disorder in psychotic disorders and their risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. We propose instead to use a novel automated linguistic corpus-based approach to language analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language, and leads to measures of semantic coherence from one phrase to the next. It also evaluates syntactic complexity through âpart-of-speechâ tagging and analysis of speech graphs. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture thought disorder.  Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we identified a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort, which included decreased semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, and decreased syntactic complexity, including shortened phrase length and decreased use of determiner pronouns (âwhichâ, âwhatâ, âthatâ). These features correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. We further cross-validated this automated approach in a second small CHR cohort, identifying a semantics/syntax classifier that classified psychosis outcome in both cohorts, and discriminated speech in recent-onset psychosis patients from normal speech.  These automated linguistic analytic methods hold great promise, but their use thus far has been circumscribed to only a few small studies that aim to discriminate schizophrenia from the norm, and in our own work, predict psychosis. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the linguistic mechanisms that underlie thought disorder. To address this gap, in response to PAR-16-136, we propose to use the RDoC construct of language production, and its linguistic corpus-based analytic paradigm, to study thought disorder dimensionally and transdiagnostically, in a large cohort of 150 putatively healthy volunteers, 150 CHR patients, and 150 recent-onset psychosis patients. We expect that latent semantic analysis will yield measures of semantic coherence that index positive thought disorder (tangentiality, derailment), whereas part-of-speech (POS) tagging/speech graphs will yields measures of syntactic complexity that index negative thought disorder (concreteness, poverty of content).  This large language dataset will be obtained from two PSYSCAN/HARMONY sites, such that these language data will be available for secondary analyses with PSYSCAN/HARMONY imaging and EEG data to study language production at the circuit and physiological levels. This large language and clinical dataset will also be archived at NIH for further linguistic analyses by other investigators. Language offers a privileged view into the mind: it is the basis by which we infer others' thoughts. In collaboration with computer scientists at IBM, we will use advanced computational speech analytic approaches to identify the linguistic basis â semantics and syntax â that underlie language production along a spectrum from normal to gradations of thought disorder. Our large international language dataset on 450 individuals will be archived at NIH as a resource for further linguistic analyses.",Using the RDoC Approach to Understand Thought Disorder: A Linguistic Corpus-Based Approach,9669113,R01MH115332,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Canis familiaris', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Felis catus', 'Genetic', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Length', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Poverty', 'Production', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Yogurt', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'functional disability', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'natural language', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'syntax', 'vector']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,468909,0.15230284060761007
"The role of amplitude modulation in perceiving speech and music Project Summary/Abstract  My career goal is to become a leading researcher on cognitive neuroscience, with a special focus on the neural mechanisms underlying auditory perception, including how humans track and perceive the fleeting audi- tory information in speech and music. In this proposal, I outline a research program to investigate the acoustic and neural distinctions between speech and music, two specialized forms of auditory signals that are closely tied to the human mind. Despite our increasingly rich understanding of the perceptual and neural mechanisms for processing speech or music, surprisingly little is known about why and how they are treated as different au- ditory signals by the human mind and brain in the first place. Investigating these distinctions is foundational for a thorough understanding of how acoustic waveforms are transformed into meaningful information. The work will provide a more solid basis for understanding cognition and communication as well as treating people with communicative deficits, such as people with autism, Alzheimer's disease, and aphasia.  I hypothesize that the temporal structure reflected in the amplitude modulation (AM) of speech and music signals is a critical distinctive feature for the brain and engages to different processing pathways, as speech and music are known to have distinct AM rates. A series of studies, combining psychophysics, MEG (magne- toencephalography), fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), and machine learning approaches, will use stimuli with AM rates across the modulation frequency ranges of speech and music to address this topic at the computational (the goals), algorithmic (the representations and operations), and implementational (neural mechanism) levels. (1) Does the AM rate of a sound affect whether it will be perceived as speech or music? (2) Does the AM rate of a stimulus optimize speech and music perceptual performance at different frequencies? (3) What are the underlying neural mechanisms and the associated brain regions implementing the differentiation of speech and music? Aim 1 investigates whether the AM rate of a sound conditions it to be processed as speech or music. By manipulating the AM rate of noise-vocoded speech and music recordings, I hypothesize that the sounds with slower or faster AM rates will likely to be perceived as music or speech, respectively, the perceptual judgment will be biased by the higher or lower spectral energy of neural oscillatory activity (meas- ured by MEG) while listening to the sounds, respectively, and the associated brain regions will be revealed by fMRI with machine learning decoding approaches. Aim 2 investigates whether the AM rate of stimuli optimizes speech and music perceptual performances at different rates. I hypothesize that the music perceptual perfor- mance is optimal at slower AM rates while the speech perceptual performance is optimal at faster AM rates, and the neural oscillatory entrainment at lower or higher frequency band has domain-specific function facilitat- ing speech or music perceptual performance. Project Narrative Speech and music are two specialized forms of auditory signal that are closely tied to human mind; however, despite our increasingly rich understanding of the perceptual and neural mechanisms of human processing of speech or music, surprisingly little is known how they are treated as different auditory signals by the human mind and brain at the first place. The current proposal aims to investigate the fundamental differences between speech and music at the acoustic, perceptual, and neural levels, by combining psychophysics, neuroimaging, and machine learning approaches. Investigating their distinctions is crucial for understanding how acoustic waveforms are transformed into meaningful information, and it will provide the basis for understanding and treating people with communicative deficits, such as people with autism, Alzheimer's disease, and aphasia.",The role of amplitude modulation in perceiving speech and music,9835650,F32DC018205,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Judgment', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mind', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'career', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'non-invasive imaging', 'operation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sound', 'spectral energy', 'speech processing']",NIDCD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,60854,0.27243138475988044
"Prolonging Functional Speech in Persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Real-Time Virtual Vocal Tract People with ALS eventually and inevitably experience serious speech impairment due to progressive deterioration of brain cells that control movements of the tongue, lips and jaw. Despite the devastating consequences of this speech impairment on quality of life and survival, few options are available to assist impaired oral communication, and many existing speech-generating technologies are slow to operate and cost prohibitive. This project seeks to improve quality of life for persons with impaired speech due to ALS by testing the effectiveness of a low-cost, speech-generating device (a virtual vocal tract) that could significantly prolong the ability of these patients to communicate orally. If successful, these techniques could be extended for use by patients' with a broad range of speech motor impairments. The virtual vocal track uses machine learning algorithms to predict what a person is attempting to say, in real-time, based solely on lip movements. Users of the device are able to trigger the playback of a number of predetermined phrases by simply attempting to articulate what they want to say. Our previous work has shown the feasibility of this approach using cost-prohibitive laboratory systems such as electromagnetic articulography. Recent advances in 3D depth mapping camera technology allow these techniques to be tested for the first time using technologies, which are low-cost, portable and already being integrated into consumer devices such as laptops and cellphones. To this end, the system under development will be tested in 60 patients with ALS, representing a range of speech impairment from normal to severe speech intelligibility (15 normal, 15 mild, 15 moderate, 15 severe). During testing, participants will be cued to articulate the phrases in a random order as fast as is comfortable for them. The entire session will be recorded and the following variables will be measured offline: recognition accuracy, recognition latency, task time, % completion, and communication rate (words per minute). Users will rate the usability and acceptability of the virtual vocal tract immediately following device testing, using the System Usability Scale. Results of this testing will be used to address the following specific aims: (1) Determine the accuracy and latency of real-time phrase synthesis based on dysarthric speech using the virtual vocal tract, (2) Determine the usability and acceptability of real-time phrases produced using the virtual vocal tract, and (3) Identify the articulatory and speech factors that degrade recognition accuracy. People with ALS eventually and inevitably experience serious speech impairment due to progressive bulbar motor deterioration. Despite the devastating consequences of this impairment to quality of life, few options are available to assist or prolong impaired oral communication. The goal of the proposed work is to lay the groundwork for development of a low-cost speech-generating deviceâa virtual vocal tractâthat can prolong functional oral communication for people with bulbar motor deterioration. This project seeks to testing the efficacy of a low-cost, speech-generating device (a virtual vocal tract) that records lip movements in real-time and triggers the playback of prerecorded phrases as users articulate what they want to say. If successful, the virtual device could provide an alternative means of oral communication for the large number of persons with unintelligible speech but still able to move their oral structures.",Prolonging Functional Speech in Persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Real-Time Virtual Vocal Tract,9719822,K24DC016312,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Articulation', 'Articulators', 'Bypass', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dysarthria', 'Effectiveness', 'Electromagnetics', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Oral', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Sound', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'clear speech', 'cost', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'jaw movement', 'laptop', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'orofacial', 'phrases', 'portability', 'spatiotemporal', 'time use', 'usability', 'virtual', 'virtual vocal tract']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,K24,2019,189841,0.2799142069615122
"Studying the Laryngeal Mechanisms Underlying Dysphonia in Connected Speech Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal aims to employ the recent advancement of coupling fiberoptic endoscopes with high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) systems to obtain HSV recordings during connected speech. The goal is to study vocal mechanisms underlying dysphonia in patients with neurogenic voice disorders. The long-term goal of this line of research is to create clinically applicable quantitative methods for functional measurement of vocal fold vibration in connected speech using innovative laryngeal imaging, an approach that could advance clinical voice assessment and treatment practice. In Aim 1, HSV-based measures of vocal fold kinematics will be developed and the influence of these measures on voice audio-perceptual qualities in the patients will be determined. Image processing techniques will be developed to extract such measures from the HSV data in connected speech. The extracted measures will be given as inputs to the statistical models to determine the source of the differences between the normal controls and the patients for different speech phonetic contexts and words. This aim provides an unbiased HSV-based method to predict voice quality. Developing such HSV-based methodology for functional laryngeal examination in connected speech can enhance clinical voice assessment. In addition, better understanding the influence of phonetic context would lead to optimizing the protocols for functional voice assessment through laryngeal imaging in connected speech. In Aim 2, machine learning approaches will be employed to discover hidden physics and unknown laryngeal mechanisms of voice production in the dysphonic patients. The findings of this project will help make necessary adjustments in biomechanical or physiological characteristics of vocal folds to enhance voice quality in patients with neurogenic voice disorders. Therefore, the outcome of this research will aid clinicians in properly selecting, and developing new treatment strategies (therapeutic, medicinal, or surgical), which are based on the gained knowledge of laryngeal mechanisms of dysphonia. The proposed research is in harmony with multiple priority areas of the NIDCD, described in the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan. Both aims support Priority 3 (improve methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention) through developing objective HSV-based measures and predicting the voice quality. Comparing laryngeal mechanisms in normal and disordered voices addresses Priority 1 (deepen our understanding of the normal function of the systems of human communication). Both aims propose to study laryngeal mechanisms in patients with neurogenic and functional voice disorders, which addresses Priority 2 (increase our knowledge about conditions that alter or diminish communication and health). Project Narrative  The goal of this proposal is to determine laryngeal mechanisms underlying dysphonia in connected speech, which will lead to development of clinically applicable quantitative methods for functional laryngeal examination in connected speech using laryngeal imaging. This can potentially result in enhancement of clinical voice assessment and development of new clinical voice management strategies to better help people with voice disorders.",Studying the Laryngeal Mechanisms Underlying Dysphonia in Connected Speech,9720522,K01DC017751,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysphonia', 'Endoscopes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Larynx', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Voice Disturbances', 'Voice Quality', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'sex', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'vibration', 'vocal cord', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,137795,0.21712639017022606
"Acoustic speech analysis of patients with decompensated heart failure Abstract Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause of hospitalization among Americans over 65 years of age. A major goal of HF management is to maintain stability by predicting and preventing episodes of acute decompensated HF (ADHF). Body weight is currently used for non-invasive, at-home monitoring of volume status, and as an early warning for decompensation, by patients with HF. However, HF-related weight changes occur relatively close to the onset of symptoms and may not be detected in time to prevent an episode of decompensation. In contrast, the vocal folds consist of thin tissue layers that are impacted by body hydration levels and may therefore be especially sensitive to HF-related fluid retention. The amount of laryngeal edema required to change voice acoustics is expected to be small relative to the large amount of systemic edema needed to significantly increase body weight. Therefore, we hypothesize that clinicians will be able to detect and track HF-related volume overload more closely by monitoring voice metrics in addition to weight. The goal of this project is to investigate the potential of voice and speech characteristics as correlates of clinical improvement during treatment for ADHF. In a pilot study, acoustic voice and speech measures from ten HF patients undergoing diuresis for HF were analyzed. Several promising voice measures were identified for additional investigation, including measures reflecting higher pitch and increased vocal stability following successful ADHF treatment. In this project, the study size will be expanded to facilitate more rigorous and extensive statistical analysis techniques, including machine learning and multi-level modeling analyses. Additionally, the potential of a neck-surface vibration sensor for noise-robust, confidential monitoring of ADHF status will be evaluated. The vibration sensor has been used extensively for voice monitoring in our lab because it is minimally affected by environmental noise and does not record intelligible speech, making it ideal for recording voice while preserving patient privacy in noisy environments. The performance of microphone-based recordings in predicting patientsâ heart failure status will be compared with that of vibration-sensor-based recordings, with the hypothesis that the vibration sensor will work as well as, or better than, a conventional audio microphone. Completion of this project will result in a novel, voice-based method using wearable sensor technology to provide a monitoring system for HF patients recovering from decompensation, and will aid us in future work as we move towards developing an early warning system for patients at risk of ADHF. Project Narrative The proposed project will investigate how voice and speech production change in response to treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), which is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of fluid throughout the body. Excess fluid in the vocal folds and lungs is hypothesized to cause a number of changes in voice and speech, which can be detected with acoustic analysis of recordings from both a conventional microphone and a novel neck-skin vibration sensor.

"Using Speech Acoustics to Reveal Motor Disruptions in Psychosis Project summary The goal of this project is to investigate the feasibility of using speech acoustics as a clinical biomarker in individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for developing psychosis. There is evidence that disruptions to cortico-cerebellar circuits in individuals experiencing attenuated psychosis symptoms impact motor control of the face and limbs. This proposal would be the first study to examine whether these motor disruptions in high-risk populations also affect the complex motor control required for speech. In Aim 1 an instrumental approach will be used to investigate the acoustic correlates of psychosis risk. Specifically, speech data will be collected to investigate fine-grained acoustic properties of vowels and consonants in simple repetition tasks as well as during more naturalistic conversational speech. The speech of CHR young adults will be compared to age-matched healthy controls to discover if there are group differences in the speech acoustics that allow us to classify speech samples into healthy and clinical groups. To enable fast, reliable analysis, machine learning-based algorithms will be used to measure the acoustics speech properties of interest. In Aim 2, the speech properties measured in Aim 1 will be compared to other behavioral measures, in order to discover if they correlate with several measures of cerebellar dysfunction (posture control, procedural learning, and motor timing) that are known to occur in CHR individuals. These measures will provide convergent validity for these novel speech measures. Cognitive capabilities which are related and unrelated to speech and motor control will also be assessed, to provide specificity and divergent validity to these measures. In Aim 3, the links between speech features and changes in symptom severity will be assessed at two time points, connecting changes in speech motor control to longitudinal changes in the progression of the symptoms over 12 months. These investigations may reveal speech as a novel and easily-collected biomarker enabling early detection of psychosis risk. Project narrative The goal of this proposal is to determine whether speech patterns can signal vulnerability to psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Speech samples will be collected from high-risk and matched healthy control participants in order to: determine if there are abnormalities in the acoustics of vowels and consonants; evaluate if these properties map on to dysfunction of the cerebellum (a brain region impacted in the development of psychosis that also plays a role in speech motor control); and relate these properties to symptom severity and illness progression. This study will lay the groundwork for the use of speech as an inexpensive, non-invasive, and mechanistically-relevant metric that will ultimately support earlier identification and facilitate timely treatment.",Using Speech Acoustics to Reveal Motor Disruptions in Psychosis,9746454,R21MH119677,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Articulators', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellar Diseases', 'Cerebellum', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Control Groups', 'Cueing for speech', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Fingers', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Larynx', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Roter', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'tool', 'vocal control', 'young adult']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,239000,0.300409983810214
"Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events We experience the world as a continuous sequence of events, but we remember the events as segmented episodes (e.g., my sisterâs wedding). During encoding, we associate a sequence of relevant events and segment deviant events. At retrieval, episodic memory utilizes the encoded associations to replay the flow of events. The encoded associations lead to remembering the sequence of events that occurred within an episode better than the flow of events across segments. The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortices (PFC) are essential parts of the neural circuit for segmenting, linking, and retrieving memories of associated events. This proposal aims to identify neural dynamics in the hippocampus-PFC circuit that support encoding a naturalistic flow of events, i.e., sequences of words. We will determine these neural dynamics using intracranial encephalography (iEEG) acquired from the hippocampus and PFC of epileptic patients, who have electrodes implemented for pre-surgical seizure monitoring. I will model associations of words using Natural Language Processing algorithms, and I will combine the extracted features with advanced data analysis techniques including multivariate pattern analysis to determine neural dynamics engaged during encoding. I will use speech as a model with an identical flow of events in the speech stimuli across participants. This consistency will allow validation of effects across a group of participants. Algorithms for identifying features of speech are well developed and freely available. I will specifically use elements of speech that distinguish context, word dependencies, and reference points of pronouns for modeling concurrent changes in patterns of activity in the local field potential recorded from the hippocampus and PFC. The central hypotheses are that bidirectional communications between the hippocampus and PFC support the encoding of sequences of events and successful subsequent memory. To address a causal relationship between hippocampal function and event segmentation, I will study speech comprehension and speech memory in developmental amnesic patients who suffer from hippocampal damage and have trouble tracking reference points in a speech. To achieve the proposalâs goals, I will pursue training under the mentorship of Dr. Elizabeth Buffalo (University of Washington) that will focus on the advanced analysis of local field potentials. The advanced study of human iEEG data will include comparable electrophysiology signal analyses that have been applied to the recordings from the hippocampus of non-human primates in Buffaloâs memory lab. This skill-set along with ongoing mentoring from Dr. Robert Knight (University of California, Berkeley), who has an established laboratory for human iEEG, and my previous work on human iEEG will provide a vigorous methodological, conceptual, and analytical basis for developing an independent research program. The combination of iEEG, Natural Language Processing modeling, and patientsâ behavioral data will provide valuable insights into the neural dynamics of effective speech encoding that predicts subsequent memory, which may inform development into therapeutic interventions. The ability to segment the world into meaningful episodes engages the human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Using direct electrophysiological recording from the human brain, advanced analytical techniques, Natural Language Processing models, and the behavior of patients with hippocampal lesions, this proposal will determine the neural dynamics for efficient encoding of sequences of words that predicts successful memory formation. The findings of this proposal may help inform the development of neural prosthetics for assisting patients with memory deficits.",Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events,9753679,K99MH120048,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Buffaloes', 'California', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sister', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Work', 'deviant', 'encephalography', 'experience', 'indexing', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'nonhuman primate', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,103471,0.09329362980053299
"Using the RDoC Approach to Understand Thought Disorder: A Linguistic Corpus-Based Approach Contact PD/PI: Corcoran, Cheryl M  Thought disorder in psychotic disorders and their risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. We propose instead to use a novel automated linguistic corpus-based approach to language analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language, and leads to measures of semantic coherence from one phrase to the next. It also evaluates syntactic complexity through âpart-of-speechâ tagging and analysis of speech graphs. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture thought disorder.  Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we identified a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort, which included decreased semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, and decreased syntactic complexity, including shortened phrase length and decreased use of determiner pronouns (âwhichâ, âwhatâ, âthatâ). These features correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. We further cross-validated this automated approach in a second small CHR cohort, identifying a semantics/syntax classifier that classified psychosis outcome in both cohorts, and discriminated speech in recent-onset psychosis patients from normal speech.  These automated linguistic analytic methods hold great promise, but their use thus far has been circumscribed to only a few small studies that aim to discriminate schizophrenia from the norm, and in our own work, predict psychosis. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the linguistic mechanisms that underlie thought disorder. To address this gap, in response to PAR-16-136, we propose to use the RDoC construct of language production, and its linguistic corpus-based analytic paradigm, to study thought disorder dimensionally and transdiagnostically, in a large cohort of 150 putatively healthy volunteers, 150 CHR patients, and 150 recent-onset psychosis patients. We expect that latent semantic analysis will yield measures of semantic coherence that index positive thought disorder (tangentiality, derailment), whereas part-of-speech (POS) tagging/speech graphs will yields measures of syntactic complexity that index negative thought disorder (concreteness, poverty of content).  This large language dataset will be obtained from two PSYSCAN/HARMONY sites, such that these language data will be available for secondary analyses with PSYSCAN/HARMONY imaging and EEG data to study language production at the circuit and physiological levels. This large language and clinical dataset will also be archived at NIH for further linguistic analyses by other investigators. Project Summary/Abstract Page 7 Contact PD/PI: Corcoran, Cheryl M Language offers a privileged view into the mind: it is the basis by which we infer others' thoughts. In collaboration with computer scientists at IBM, we will use advanced computational speech analytic approaches to identify the linguistic basis â semantics and syntax â that underlie language production along a spectrum from normal to gradations of thought disorder. Our large international language dataset on 450 individuals will be archived at NIH as a resource for further linguistic analyses.

"Dynamics of Vocal Tract Shaping ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to wed state-of-the-art technology for imaging the vocal tract with a linguistically informed analysis of dynamic vocal tract constriction actions in order to understand the control and production of the compositional units of spoken language. We have pioneered the use of real time MRI for speech imaging to illuminate articulatory dynamics and to understand how these emerge lawfully from the combined effects of vocal tract constriction events distributed over space (subparts of the tract) and over time. This project has developed and refined a novel real time MRI acquisition ability, making possible current reconstruction rates of up to 96 frames per second, quadrupling current imaging speeds. Data show clear real- time movements of the lips, tongue, velum and epiglottis, providing exquisite information about the spatiotemporal properties of speech gestures in both the oral and pharyngeal portions of the vocal tract. The project has also developed novel noise-mitigated image-synchronized strategies to record speech in-situ during imaging, as well as image processing strategies for deriving linguistically meaningful measures from the data, demon- strating the utility of this approach for linguistic studies of speech communication in a variety of languages. Using our direct access to dynamic information on vocal tract shaping, we investigate vocal tract shaping in three-dimensions as the composition of spatiotemporally coordinated vocal tract action units. This project's specific aims go beyond the dynamic shaping of individual vowels and consonants-postures over time-to examine more complex structuring of articulation-namely, the local and global influences governing linguistic control, temporal coherence and multi-unit coordination. The advances in our technical approach enable a series of studies that leverage: (i) unprecedented high-speech imaging with dynamic rtMRI to consider the prosodic modulation of temporally rapid and temporally coherent speech units; (ii) innovative multi-plane 3D imaging capability to inform the computational identification of linguistic control regimes; and (iii) a large- scale rtMRI corpus ad concomitant machine learning advances to move toward a principled account of system-level co-variability in space and time, both within and among individuals. This symbiotic theory-driven and data-driven research strategy will yield significant innovations in understanding spoken communication. It is no exaggeration to say that the advent of real-time MRI for speech has initiated a dramatic scientific change in the nature of speech production research by allowing for models of production driven by rich quantitative articulatory data. The project is having broad impact through the free dissemination of the unique rtMRI data corpora, tools and models-already used worldwide for research and teaching-and societal out- reach through its website and lay media coverage. Understanding articulatory compositional structure and cross-linguistic potentialities also has critical translational significance impacting the assessment and remediation of speech disorders, as our collaborative work on glossectomy and apraxia has begun to demonstrate. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time imaging of the moving vocal tract with MRI has made direct movies of speech production possible, allowing an investigation of the articulatory composition of speech in healthy adults and illuminating the articulatory dissolution and lack of coherence often found in spoken language disorders. This technology platform, coupled with a linguistically driven theoretical framework that understands speech as composed of articulatory units, provides a scientific foothold for evidence-driven assessment and remediation of speech breakdown in clinical populations, including articulatory remediation and training and deploying assistive technologies for the impaired (automatic speech recognition, machine speech synthesis), and has potential broad impact on the clinical needs of those with swallowing disorders, sleep apnea, or facing recovery of speech function after stroke or surgery. Further, because speech presents the only example of rapid, cognitively- controlled, internal movements of the body, the unique challenges of speech production imaging offer the wider biomedical imaging community traction for advances that improve temporal and spatial image resolution-advances with potential import for cardiac and other imaging.",Dynamics of Vocal Tract Shaping,9605700,R01DC007124,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Apraxias', 'Articulation', 'Articulators', 'Beds', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Epiglottis structure', 'Event', 'German population', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Larynx', 'Lateral', 'Linguistics', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Pattern', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cohesion', 'computerized tools', 'constriction', 'dexterity', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'movie', 'novel', 'outreach', 'phonology', 'post stroke', 'program dissemination', 'public health relevance', 'real-time images', 'reconstruction', 'remediation', 'shape analysis', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech synthesis', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'tongue apex', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,467515,0.3044822393919663
"Wearable silent speech technology to enhance impaired oral communication Project Summary/Abstract The long-term objectives of this project are to obtain a deeper understanding how articulatory movement patterns are mapped to speech particularly when there is no vocal fold vibration (silent speech) and then to develop a novel, wearable assistive technology called silent speech interface (SSI) to assist the impaired oral communication for individuals in need (e.g., individuals after laryngectomy, surgical removal of larynx to treat advanced laryngeal cancer). Designed for daily use, the SSI contains a wearable magnetic device and a small camera for tongue and lip motion tracking, respectively, and an articulation-to-speech synthesizer to output natural sounding speech that preserves the speakerâs voice characteristics. Specific Aims of the proposal include to (1) determine the articulatory patterns of normal (vocalized) and silent speech, produced by both healthy talkers and people after laryngectomy, (2) develop a wearable, wireless magnetic device for real-time tongue and lip motion tracking, and (3) synthesize speech from articulation directly. There are currently limited alternative communication options for people who have undergone laryngectomy. These options include esophageal speech, tracheo-esophageal speech, and use of an artificial larynx (or electrolarynx). These solutions are either invasive or difficult to use, and all of them result in a hoarse or mechanical/robotic sounding voice, which can be difficult to understand. In contrast, the SSI in this application is non-invasive, easy-to-use, and produces natural sounding speech and may even preserve the patientâs voice identity. We have exciting preliminary results that support the feasibility of the project including that (1) we have recently developed a wireless magnetic device for tongue motion, and (2) we have demonstrated real- time articulation-to-speech synthesis with a 90% word accuracy (judged by a human listener). In this project, we will further reduce the size of the wireless device and make it wearable and conduct articulation-to-speech algorithms by studying 30 participants after laryngectomy and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. If successful, the proposed research will enhance human health by making an impact on individuals after laryngectomy and potentially to a broader range of other speech and voice disorders. In addition, the technology will have an impact to the speech science field by providing a fist-time-ever tool for potential large- scale tongue motion data collection and have a variety of broader implications including visual feedback-based secondary language training and speech therapy, which may benefit millions of people with motor speech deficits in the United States. Project Narrative Silent speech interfaces (SSI) is a novel assistive technology for enhancing the oral communication for people who are unable to produce speech sounds (e.g., individuals who undergo laryngectomy, removal of larynx to treat advanced laryngeal cancer). The proposed SSI is a wearable device for tongue motion tracking and produces synthesized, natural sounding speech that preserves the patientâs voice characteristics in real-time, which holds potential to enhance the speech health and quality of life of laryngectomees. The technology also has potential for a variety of broader applications including visual feedback-based secondary language training and speech therapy.",Wearable silent speech technology to enhance impaired oral communication,9740858,R01DC016621,"['Acoustics', 'Age', 'Alaryngeal Speech', 'Algorithms', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Articulation', 'Articulators', 'Characteristics', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electrolarynx', 'Electromagnetics', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Esophageal Speech', 'Excision', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hoarseness', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal Prosthesis', 'Laryngectomee', 'Laryngectomy', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'Speech Synthesizers', 'Speech Therapy', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Tracer', 'Tracheoesophageal Speech', 'United States', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Voice Quality', 'Wireless Technology', 'alternative communication', 'auditory feedback', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'language training', 'machine learning algorithm', 'millisecond', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'sound', 'speech synthesis', 'tool', 'vibration', 'visual feedback', 'vocal cord', 'wearable device']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2019,618564,0.3278388876084891
"Objectively Quantifying Speech Outcomes of Children with Cleft Palate Perceptual assessment of hypernasality is considered a critical component when evaluating the speech of children with cleft lip and/or palate (CLP). However, most speech-language pathologists (SLPs) do not receive formal training for perceptual evaluation of speech and, as a result, research shows that the subjective ratings are inherently biased to the perceiver and exhibit considerable variability. In this project, we aim to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that automatically evaluates speech along four dimensions deemed to be critically important by the Americleft Speech Outcomes Group (ASOG), namely speech acceptability, articulation, hypernasality, and audible nasal emissions. The AI algorithm in this project is based on an existing database of speech collected as a part of an NIH-funded project to develop reliable speech outcomes by improving the reliability of perceptual ratings by training clinicians (NIDCR DE019-01235, PI: Kathy Chapman). This database contains speech samples from 125 5-7 year olds along with multiple perceptual rating for each speech sample. The clinicians participating in this study were successfully trained using a new protocol from the Americleft Speech Outcomes Group and they exhibit excellent inter-clinician reliability.  In SA1 we will develop an AI algorithm that automatically learns the relationship between a comprehensive set of speech acoustics and the average of the ASOG-trained expert ratings for each of the four perceptual dimensions. This approach is based on technology that the PIs have successfully used to evaluate dysarthric speech. Unique to these algorithms is modeling of perceptual judgments of trained experts using tools from statistical signal processing and AI. The output of the algorithms will map to a clinically- relevant scale, rather than to norm-referenced values that may or may not be meaningful. In SA2, we will evaluate the tool on new data by collecting new speech samples using a mobile app at a partner clinic using the same protocol as in the original study. Every collected sample will be further evaluated by ASOG trained clinicians. We will use this data to evaluate the accuracy of the AI model by comparing the model's predictions with the average of ASOG-trained experts. Preliminary results show promise that the proposed approach will yield a successful tool for accurately characterizing perceptual dimensions in the speech of children with CLP. These results indicate that a number of acoustic features that have been developed previously by the PIs accurately capture differences in hypernasality and articulation between the speech of three children with CLP (with varying severity). Furthermore, we show the success of our approach on a different, but related, task: objective evaluation of dysarthric speech. We show that an algorithm that automatically rates hypernasality performs on par with the judgment of human evaluators. The results of the proposed research will form the basis for a subsequent R01 proposal for the development and evaluation of a clinical tool to objectively quantify and track speech production in children with CLP. Project Narrative Perceptual assessment of the speech of children with cleft lip and/or palate is commonly used as a key clinical indicator upon which follow-on decisions are made about intervention. However, studies show that the inter- clinician reliability can be low. As an alternative, we propose a new objective outcome tool based on signal processing and artificial intelligence that automatically assesses speech acceptability, articulation, hypernasality, and audible nasal emissions directly from speech; the output of the tool is on a scale defined by the Americleft Speech Outcomes Group and can be used by clinicians to objectively measure progress.",Objectively Quantifying Speech Outcomes of Children with Cleft Palate,9765280,R21DE026252,"['7 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Articulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Cleft Palate', 'Cleft lip with or without cleft palate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ear', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Four-dimensional', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Reference Values', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Disorders', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cleft lip and palate', 'clinically relevant', 'craniofacial', 'impression', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2019,225535,0.32591918276628695
"Neurophysiology of robust speech perception in human superior temporal gyrus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Perceiving and following an individual speaker in a crowded, noisy environment is a commonplace task for listeners with normal hearing. The underlying neurophysiology, however, is complex, and the task remains a struggle for people with peripheral and central auditory pathway disorders. The lack of a detailed neurobiological model of mechanisms and functions underlying robust speech perception has hindered our understanding of how these processes become impaired in the suffering population. In our innovative approach, we will record from high-density micro and macro electrode arrays surgically implanted on the superior temporal gyrus of epilepsy patients as part of their clinical evaluation. This method offers an exceptionally detailed perspective of cortical population activity. We will build upon two recent complementary findings where we identified a highly selective, spatially distributed neural representation of phonetic features (Mesgarani et. al. Science, 2014), which at the same time is highly dynamic and can change rapidly to reflect the perceptual bias of the listener (Mesgarani & Chang, Nature 2012). While significant, these studies revealed several gaps in our understanding of this process, which we intend to address in this proposal. Specifically, we will resolve the following unanswered questions: 1) what is the neural mechanism for joint encoding of both phonetic and speaker features? 2) How does attention modulate phonetic and speaker feature selectivity of neural responses? And 3) what computational mechanisms can account for dynamic feature selectivity of responses in STG? Answering these questions will significantly advance our understanding of a remarkable human ability, and will be of great interest to researchers from many areas including neurologists, and sensory and cognitive neuroscientists. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the mechanisms underlying speech perception in challenging environments is a crucial step in determining how these processes deteriorate in various disorders of peripheral and central auditory pathways. Our studies will result in novel neurobiological models of robust speech perception that will serve as a necessary step toward designing innovative therapeutic measures.",Neurophysiology of robust speech perception in human superior temporal gyrus,9650571,R01DC014279,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathology', 'Speech Perception', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Voice', 'Work', 'attentional modulation', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive ability', 'computer framework', 'density', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'selective attention', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,398995,0.12471153486932793
"NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF OPTIMAL MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Speech perception is one of the most important cognitive operations performed by the human brain and is fundamentally multisensory: when conversing with someone, we use both visual information from their face and auditory information from their voice. Multisensory speech perception is especially important when the auditory component of the speech is noisy, either due to a hearing disorder or normal aging. However, much less is known about the neural computations underlying visual speech perception than about those underlying auditory speech perception. To remedy this gap in existing knowledge, we will use converging evidence from two complementary measures of brain activity, BOLD fMRI and electrocorticography (ECoG). The results of these neural recording studies will be interpreted in the context of a flexible computational model based on the emerging tenet that the brain performs multisensory integration using optimal or Bayesian inference, combining the currently available sensory information with prior experience.  In the first Aim, a Bayesian model will be constructed to explain individual differences in multisensory speech perception along three axes: subjects' ability to understand noisy audiovisual speech; subjects' susceptibility to the McGurk effect, a multisensory illusion; and the time spent fixating the mouth of a talking face.  In the second Aim, we will explore the neural encoding of visual speech using voxel-wise forward encoding models of the BOLD fMRI signal. We will develop encoding models to test 7 different theories of visual speech representation from the linguistic and computer vision literature. In the third Aim, we will use ECoG to examine the neural computations for integrating visual and auditory speech, guided by the Bayesian models developed in Aim 1. First, we will study reduced neural variability for multisensory speech predicted by our model. Second, we will study the representational space of unisensory and multisensory speech. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding speech is one of the most important functions of the human brain. We use information from both the auditory modality (the voice of the person we are talking to) and the visual modality (the facial movements of the person we are talking to) to understand speech. We will use computational models, eye tracking, and brain imaging and recording techniques to study the organization and operation of the brain during audiovisual speech perception.",NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF OPTIMAL MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION,9607116,R01NS065395,"['Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oral cavity', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'audiovisual speech', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'hearing impairment', 'multisensory', 'neural model', 'normal aging', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'speech accuracy', 'theories', 'visual information', 'visual speech']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,346719,0.2855438796579336
"Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease ABSTRACT Dr. Kara Smith is a Movement Disorders neurologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) whose goal is to become an independent investigator focused on early cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD). Her long-term goal is to develop speech markers of cognitive impairment in PD. Cognitive impairment occurs in the majority of PD patients, leading to increased mortality and decreased quality of life. The current diagnostic tools are resource-intensive and have limited sensitivity. Treatments are often offered late in the course of cognitive decline and do not provide optimal benefit. Speech markers could improve detection, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in PD. Speech markers could be monitored frequently and remotely via mobile technology, capturing sensitive, quantitative data about cognitive function in the context of patientsâ daily life and in response to therapeutics. Dr. Smithâs role as a clinical movement disorders specialist ideally positions her to lead the application of advanced speech and language research to feasible, patient-oriented tools for real-life clinical practice and clinical trials. Dr. Smith has assembled an expert interdisciplinary mentorship team ideally suited for the goals of this innovative proposal. Dr. Smith and her team have previously shown that a) speech acoustic markers are associated with cognitive function in non-demented PD patients, and b) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment had linguistic deficits including pauses within utterances and grammaticality. Building on these results, Dr. Smith proposes to study speech and language more comprehensively in PD patients with and without mild cognitive impairment and controls to confirm these preliminary results and identify additional biomarkers. The aims of this study will be 1) to develop algorithms using speech acoustic markers to categorize by cognitive status, 2) to identify linguistic markers associated with mild cognitive impairment in PD, and 3) to assess on-line syntactic processing in PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The overall goal of the proposal is to identify speech and language markers of early cognitive dysfunction that can be further refined, validated and implemented using mobile technology into a larger scale, longitudinal R01 proposal. Further work will also address the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these speech markers. Dr. Smithâs rigorous training plan includes a Masterâs degree, linguistics and speech motor physiology courses, and experience in signal processing and speech acoustic analysis. Through her training goals, she will advance her knowledge and skills in patient-centered outcomes measures and instrument validation. She will gain experience in research leadership, presentation and dissemination of scientific work, and in grant writing, culminating in an R01 proposal. This K23 award will be critical for Dr. Smith to establish an independent career as a PD clinician-scientist at the unique intersection of speech and language science and cognitive impairment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Speech markers have the potential to improve diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinsonâs disease (PD). Although the majority of PD patients will develop cognitive impairment, the tools available to assess and treat this disabling complication are fraught with limitations. As a detailed and quantitative assessment tool, speech markers may increase sensitivity to early cognitive dysfunction and to changes over time compared with current measures. They may be automated and then implemented through mobile technology to increase patientsâ access to cognitive symptom monitoring outside of the clinic setting. Dr. Smithâs proposed career development plan has potential to fill a major gap in PD research by making inexpensive and easy-to-use cognitive assessment tools accessible to patients in rural and international settings, and by fueling clinical trials to discover new therapeutics capable of slowing cognitive decline in PD.",Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease,9666574,K23DC016656,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical movement disorder', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'common symptom', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'language processing', 'learning strategy', 'lexical retrieval', 'medical schools', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'motor deficit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2019,188946,0.09796580526637136
"Perception of dysarthric speech: An objective model of dysarthric speech evaluation with actionable outcomes Project Summary The trained ear of the speech-language pathologist is the gold standard assessment tool for clinical practice in motor speech disorders. However, perceptual judgments are vulnerable to bias and their relationship with estimates of listener intelligibility â the final arbiter of speech goodness â is indeterminate. Interpretable, objective, and robust outcome measures that provide targets for treatment are urgently needed in order to provide more precise care and reliably monitor patient progress. Based on theoretical models of speech perception, in our previous grants we have developed a novel set of outcome measures that provide a multidimensional intelligibility profile (MIP) by using custom speech stimuli and a new coding strategy that allows us to capture the types of errors that listeners make when listening to dysarthric speech. This has led to a more complete intelligibility profile that codifies these errors at different levels of granularity, from global to discrete. Simultaneously, we have also developed a computational model for evaluation of dysarthric speech capable of reliably estimating a limited set of intelligibility measures directly from the speech acoustics. To date, both the outcome measures and the objective model have been evaluated on cross-sectional data only. In this renewal application, our principal goal is to evaluate specific hypotheses regarding expected changes in this multidimensional intelligibility profile as a result of different intervention instruction conditions (loud, clear, slow). A secondary goal of the proposal is to further refine our objective model to predict the complete intelligibility profile and to evaluate its ability to detect intelligibility changes within individual speakers. This is critical for clinicians who currently have no objective ways to assess the value of their interventions. With the aim of improving the standard of care through technology, the long- term goal of this proposal is to develop stand-alone objective outcome measures for dysarthria that can provide clinicians with reliable treatment targets. Such applications have the potential to dramatically alter the current standard of care in speech pathology for patients with neurological disease or injury. Furthermore, these applications also have the potential to reduce health disparities by partially automating clinical intervention and providing easier access to these services to those in remote areas or in underdeveloped countries. Project Narrative There is an urgent need in the field of speech-language pathology for objective outcome measures of speech intelligibility that provide clinicians with actionable information regarding treatment targets. This proposal seeks to leverage theoretical advances in speech intelligibility to evaluate the sensitivity of a novel multidimensional intelligibility profile that quantifies the perceptual effects of speech change. Using listener transcriptions of dysarthric speech, along with a suite of automated acoustic metrics, the predictive model uses machine-learning algorithms to learn the relationship between speech acoustics and listener percepts. Ultimately, this model will allow clinicians to predict the outcomes of an intervention strategy to assess its utility for a patient.

"Optimization of Personalized Speech Synthesis Our voices are not identical, they are our identities. The human voice is a powerful signal that conveys oneâs age, gender, size, ethnicity, and personality, among other attributes. Yet, until now, users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, screen reading technologies and other text-to-speech (TTS) applications have relied on a limited set of mass-produced, generic-sounding synthetic voices. This mismatch in vocal identity impacts educational outcomes, infringes on personal safety, and hinders social integration. Conventional methods for building a synthetic voice require a voice actor to record an extensive dataset of studio-quality recordings which are used to train a computational model and generate the output voice. The process is time and labor intensive and thus inaccessible to everyday consumers let alone those with speech impairment. VocaliD Incâs award-winning technology offers an unprecedented means to build custom crafted synthetic voices that reflect the recipient by combining his/her own residual vocalizations with recordings of a matched speaker from our crowdsourced Human Voicebank. We have discovered that even a single vowel contains enough ""vocal DNA"" to seed the personalization process. VocaliDâs custom voices sound like the recipient in age, personality and vocal identity and have the clarity of everyday talkers. Having made significant progress towards improving the intelligibility and naturalness of our custom voices under Phase II, our voices are within a few percentage points of natural human speech in terms of intelligibility and rated as highly natural sounding by unfamiliar listeners. However, several persistent issues limit the commercial potential of our current methods. First, our new methods are computationally intensive and thus cannot be utilized on current assistive communication devices. Optimization of the methods to reduce latency and thereby improve usability is critical (Aim 1). Another unintended consequence of advances in clarity and naturalness of our voices is the potential for misappropriation. To counteract this, we propose developing a multi-speaker model to create unique new voices and mask the identity of a given speech donor (Aim 2). Last, although the new models are capable of more prosodic variation, current methods rely heavily on exemplars in the training data. Our customers indicate a need and desire for greater control of subtle yet meaningful differences in prosody. (Aim 3) These additional tasks will further bolster the product and likelihood of commercial success for the AAC market and beyond. VocaliDâs breakthrough technology powers the first-ever custom synthetic voices that are made using only brief samples of recipient vocalizations combined with recordings of matched speaker(s) from our crowdsourced voicebank.

"Using Machine Learning to Mitigate Reverberation Effects in Cochlear Implants ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cochlear implants (CIs) provide hearing for over 200,000 recipients worldwide {NIDCD, 2011 #637}. These devices successfully provide high levels of speech understanding in quiet listening conditions; however, more challenging conditions degrade speech comprehension for CI recipients to a much greater degree than for normal hearing listeners {Kokkinakis, 2011 #673;Nelson, 2003 #302}. CI listeners are especially affected by reverberant conditions with even a small level of reverberation degrading comprehension to a greater degree than a large amount of steady-state noise {Hazrati, 2012 #674}. Thus, a method that mitigates the effects of reverberation has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for CI users. Previous attempts to solve the problem of speech in reverberation for cochlear implants have not been able to be implemented in real time. Our preliminary results suggest that successful mitigation of overlap masking can result in a substantial improvement in speech recognition even if self-masking is not mitigated and we have devised an approach that can be implemented in real time. In the proposed effort, we will first improve the classifier to detect reverberation based on our successful preliminary efforts. Next we will assess the mitigation algorithm, first in normal hearing listeners and then in listeners with cochlear implants. Finally, we will implement the algorithm in real time and again test it. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While cochlear implants (CIs) provide high levels of speech comprehension in quiet for over 200,000 profoundly deaf individuals worldwide, speech in quiet scenarios are rarely encountered outside of the home. The presence of noise or reverberation in the listening environment decreases speech comprehension for CI users much more rapidly than for normal-hearing listeners, and of these two conditions, reverberation has a greater negative impact. The proposed research aims to provide a robust reverberation mitigation algorithm for CI speech processors thereby improving the ability of CI users to interact in real-world listening environments.",Using Machine Learning to Mitigate Reverberation Effects in Cochlear Implants,9513918,R01DC014290,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Categories', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Comprehension', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Frequencies', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'success']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,326840,0.2612885595838641
"Using the RDoC Approach to Understand Thought Disorder: A Linguistic Corpus-Based Approach Thought disorder in psychotic disorders and their risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. We propose instead to use a novel automated linguistic corpus-based approach to language analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language, and leads to measures of semantic coherence from one phrase to the next. It also evaluates syntactic complexity through âpart-of-speechâ tagging and analysis of speech graphs. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture thought disorder.  Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we identified a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort, which included decreased semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, and decreased syntactic complexity, including shortened phrase length and decreased use of determiner pronouns (âwhichâ, âwhatâ, âthatâ). These features correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. We further cross-validated this automated approach in a second small CHR cohort, identifying a semantics/syntax classifier that classified psychosis outcome in both cohorts, and discriminated speech in recent-onset psychosis patients from normal speech.  These automated linguistic analytic methods hold great promise, but their use thus far has been circumscribed to only a few small studies that aim to discriminate schizophrenia from the norm, and in our own work, predict psychosis. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the linguistic mechanisms that underlie thought disorder. To address this gap, in response to PAR-16-136, we propose to use the RDoC construct of language production, and its linguistic corpus-based analytic paradigm, to study thought disorder dimensionally and transdiagnostically, in a large cohort of 150 putatively healthy volunteers, 150 CHR patients, and 150 recent-onset psychosis patients. We expect that latent semantic analysis will yield measures of semantic coherence that index positive thought disorder (tangentiality, derailment), whereas part-of-speech (POS) tagging/speech graphs will yields measures of syntactic complexity that index negative thought disorder (concreteness, poverty of content).  This large language dataset will be obtained from two PSYSCAN/HARMONY sites, such that these language data will be available for secondary analyses with PSYSCAN/HARMONY imaging and EEG data to study language production at the circuit and physiological levels. This large language and clinical dataset will also be archived at NIH for further linguistic analyses by other investigators. Language offers a privileged view into the mind: it is the basis by which we infer others' thoughts. In collaboration with computer scientists at IBM, we will use advanced computational speech analytic approaches to identify the linguistic basis â semantics and syntax â that underlie language production along a spectrum from normal to gradations of thought disorder. Our large international language dataset on 450 individuals will be archived at NIH as a resource for further linguistic analyses.",Using the RDoC Approach to Understand Thought Disorder: A Linguistic Corpus-Based Approach,9435649,R01MH115332,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Canis familiaris', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Felis catus', 'Genetic', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Length', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Poverty', 'Production', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Yogurt', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'functional disability', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'natural language', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'syntax', 'vector']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,513989,0.15230284060761007
"Subthalamic and corticosubthalamic coding of speech production Speech production and control is disrupted in a number of neurological diseases that involve the basal ganglia. Notably, hypophonia and hypokinetic dysarthria (characterized by decreased motor gain) are prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) produces predictable improvements in other motor symptoms of PD but does not result in consistent improvement in speech and can negatively impact language function. These observations and other accumulating evidence indicate an important role for the basal ganglia in speech. However, a major impediment to developing treatments for speech deficits in movement disorders and reducing speech-related side effects of DBS is the absence of a neurophysiological model for basal ganglia participation in speech production. Testing how general tenets of basal ganglia organization and function apply to the speech motor system presents both unique challenges for clinical neuroscientists and significant opportunities to advance the cognitive neuroscience of speech production. Our overall goals are to determine how motor and linguistic speech information is encoded at multiple levels of granularity within the STN-cortical network, and to determine the relationship between neural activity within the STN-cortical network and the gain of vocal output. Despite the fact that electrophysiological data obtained during DBS surgery offers the unique opportunity to directly assess basal ganglia neuronal activity during speech, this paradigm remains remarkably unexplored. Our central hypothesis is that the STN contributes at multiple levels to the hierarchical control of speech production. Using a completely novel approach, we will rigorously test this hypothesis by simultaneously recording STN units, STN and cortical local field potentials (LFP), and spoken acoustics while PD subjects perform a speech task during DBS surgery. To test for encoding at different levels of granularity, we will explore the extent to which neuronal activity in the STN codes for articulatory and linguistic features associated with different levels of representation within the speech production system (Aim 1). To test for a role in voice modulation, we will explore the extent to which the STN codes for measures of gain, such as volume, pitch and fluency (Aim 2). Additionally, we will directly assess the causal role of STN function in speech production by delivering disruptive stimulation to the STN (Aim 3). A major strength of our project is the complimentary nature of extensive, multi-disciplinary expertise from team members at the University of Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins University and Carnegie Mellon University. This combined expertise allows us to employ a novel combination of classical analytic methods and more recent machine learning methods for supervised and exploratory analyses to document the neural dynamics of STN and cortical activity during speech production. Speech production and control is disrupted in a number of neurological diseases that involve the basal ganglia, for instance hypophonia and hypokinetic dysarthria are prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We will use a novel experimental approach and combination of analytic techniques to elucidate the contribution of neural activity in the subthalamic nucleus to the hierarchical control of speech production, in subjects with PD undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery.",Subthalamic and corticosubthalamic coding of speech production,9492650,U01NS098969,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dysarthria', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Production', 'Role', 'STN stimulation', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'gain of function', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'microstimulation', 'motor symptom', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2018,875182,0.2991315128163392
"SPEECH MOVEMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR ASSESSING AND TREATING ALS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is advance the assessment and treatment of speech motor impairments due to ALS using novel computer-based approaches. Recently developed speech movement tracking technology will be used to record movements of tongue, lips, and jaw in 50 persons with ALS and 50 healthy control participants. The speech movement data will be analyzed using custom machine learning algorithms to address three important translational needs in person with ALS: improved early detection of speech motor involvement, improved progress monitoring of speech motor decline, and improved options for maintaining oral communication. The established interdisciplinary team with expertise in data mining, speech- language pathology, clinical neurology, and spatial statistics are well positioned to conduct this research. If successful, the specific aims have the potential to transform clinical practice for speech-language pathologists, neurologists, and other related health care professionals. The propose research will enhance human health by making an impact on individuals with speech motor impairment due to ALS and potentially to a broad range of other speech motor due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, and orofacial or laryngeal cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ALS is one of the most common motor neuron diseases. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, approximately 30,000 Americans are living with ALS (NINDS, 2003). Recent evidence suggests ALS incidence is increasing in the general population (Strong & Rosenfeld, 2003), particularly among Gulf War veterans who are nearly twice as likely to develop the disease as veterans not deployed to the Gulf (Haley, 2003). This project is focused on the development and validation of novel machine-learning based tools for improving the assessment and treatment of patients with speech motor impairments due to ALS. If successful, this research may (1) improve early detection and prognostic accuracy, (2) and address the critical need for objective outcome measures for ongoing experimental drug trials, and (3) provide information to develop a novel oral communication device for persons with moderate to severe speech impairment. These developments may ameliorate the socioeconomic burden of speech motor impairments as well as the quality of life for these patients, their families, and the people they closely interact wit.",SPEECH MOVEMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR ASSESSING AND TREATING ALS,9390468,R01DC013547,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysarthria', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetics', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Language', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Oral', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Synthesizers', 'Speech-Language Pathology', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Wit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'communication device', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'innovation', 'jaw movement', 'motor impairment', 'movement analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral communication', 'orofacial', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,R01,2018,686265,0.29564149814672025
"Prolonging Functional Speech in Persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Real-Time Virtual Vocal Tract People with ALS eventually and inevitably experience serious speech impairment due to progressive deterioration of brain cells that control movements of the tongue, lips and jaw. Despite the devastating consequences of this speech impairment on quality of life and survival, few options are available to assist impaired oral communication, and many existing speech-generating technologies are slow to operate and cost prohibitive. This project seeks to improve quality of life for persons with impaired speech due to ALS by testing the effectiveness of a low-cost, speech-generating device (a virtual vocal tract) that could significantly prolong the ability of these patients to communicate orally. If successful, these techniques could be extended for use by patients' with a broad range of speech motor impairments. The virtual vocal track uses machine learning algorithms to predict what a person is attempting to say, in real-time, based solely on lip movements. Users of the device are able to trigger the playback of a number of predetermined phrases by simply attempting to articulate what they want to say. Our previous work has shown the feasibility of this approach using cost-prohibitive laboratory systems such as electromagnetic articulography. Recent advances in 3D depth mapping camera technology allow these techniques to be tested for the first time using technologies, which are low-cost, portable and already being integrated into consumer devices such as laptops and cellphones. To this end, the system under development will be tested in 60 patients with ALS, representing a range of speech impairment from normal to severe speech intelligibility (15 normal, 15 mild, 15 moderate, 15 severe). During testing, participants will be cued to articulate the phrases in a random order as fast as is comfortable for them. The entire session will be recorded and the following variables will be measured offline: recognition accuracy, recognition latency, task time, % completion, and communication rate (words per minute). Users will rate the usability and acceptability of the virtual vocal tract immediately following device testing, using the System Usability Scale. Results of this testing will be used to address the following specific aims: (1) Determine the accuracy and latency of real-time phrase synthesis based on dysarthric speech using the virtual vocal tract, (2) Determine the usability and acceptability of real-time phrases produced using the virtual vocal tract, and (3) Identify the articulatory and speech factors that degrade recognition accuracy. People with ALS eventually and inevitably experience serious speech impairment due to progressive bulbar motor deterioration. Despite the devastating consequences of this impairment to quality of life, few options are available to assist or prolong impaired oral communication. The goal of the proposed work is to lay the groundwork for development of a low-cost speech-generating deviceâa virtual vocal tractâthat can prolong functional oral communication for people with bulbar motor deterioration. This project seeks to testing the efficacy of a low-cost, speech-generating device (a virtual vocal tract) that records lip movements in real-time and triggers the playback of prerecorded phrases as users articulate what they want to say. If successful, the virtual device could provide an alternative means of oral communication for the large number of persons with unintelligible speech but still able to move their oral structures.",Prolonging Functional Speech in Persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Real-Time Virtual Vocal Tract,9525935,K24DC016312,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Articulation', 'Articulators', 'Bypass', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dysarthria', 'Effectiveness', 'Electromagnetics', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Oral', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Sound', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'clear speech', 'cost', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'jaw movement', 'laptop', 'motor impairment', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'orofacial', 'phrases', 'portability', 'spatiotemporal', 'time use', 'usability', 'virtual', 'virtual vocal tract']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,K24,2018,189841,0.2799142069615122
"Functional Architecture of Speech Motor Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Speaking is one of the most complex actions that we perform, yet nearly all of us learn do it effortlessly. The ability to communicate through speech is often described as the unique and defining trait of human behavior. Despite its importance, the basic neural mechanisms that govern our ability to speak fluently remain unresolved. This proposal addresses two fundamental questions at the crossroads of linguistics, systems neuroscience, and biomedical engineering: 1) How are the kinematic and acoustic targets of articulation represented in human speech motor cortex?, 2) What are the coordinated patterns of cortical activation that gives rise to fluent, continuous speech?, and 3) How does prefrontal cortex govern the cognitive inhibitory control of speech (e.g. stopping)? Our studies should greatly advance understanding of how the speech motor cortex encodes the precise control of articulation during speech production as well as determine whether this control system can be harnessed for novel rehabilitative strategies. Three potential areas of impact are: Neurobiology of Language, where results will shed light on neurophysiologic mechanisms of speech motor control; Human Neurophysiology, where insight gained may suggest novel methods for machine learning-based analyses of distributed population neural activity; and Translational NeuroEngineering, where utilization of novel cortical recording technologies at unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution and duration.

"Dynamics of Vocal Tract Shaping ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to wed state-of-the-art technology for imaging the vocal tract with a linguistically informed analysis of dynamic vocal tract constriction actions in order to understand the control and production of the compositional units of spoken language. We have pioneered the use of real time MRI for speech imaging to illuminate articulatory dynamics and to understand how these emerge lawfully from the combined effects of vocal tract constriction events distributed over space (subparts of the tract) and over time. This project has developed and refined a novel real time MRI acquisition ability, making possible current reconstruction rates of up to 96 frames per second, quadrupling current imaging speeds. Data show clear real- time movements of the lips, tongue, velum and epiglottis, providing exquisite information about the spatiotemporal properties of speech gestures in both the oral and pharyngeal portions of the vocal tract. The project has also developed novel noise-mitigated image-synchronized strategies to record speech in-situ during imaging, as well as image processing strategies for deriving linguistically meaningful measures from the data, demon- strating the utility of this approach for linguistic studies of speech communication in a variety of languages. Using our direct access to dynamic information on vocal tract shaping, we investigate vocal tract shaping in three-dimensions as the composition of spatiotemporally coordinated vocal tract action units. This project's specific aims go beyond the dynamic shaping of individual vowels and consonants-postures over time-to examine more complex structuring of articulation-namely, the local and global influences governing linguistic control, temporal coherence and multi-unit coordination. The advances in our technical approach enable a series of studies that leverage: (i) unprecedented high-speech imaging with dynamic rtMRI to consider the prosodic modulation of temporally rapid and temporally coherent speech units; (ii) innovative multi-plane 3D imaging capability to inform the computational identification of linguistic control regimes; and (iii) a large- scale rtMRI corpus ad concomitant machine learning advances to move toward a principled account of system-level co-variability in space and time, both within and among individuals. This symbiotic theory-driven and data-driven research strategy will yield significant innovations in understanding spoken communication. It is no exaggeration to say that the advent of real-time MRI for speech has initiated a dramatic scientific change in the nature of speech production research by allowing for models of production driven by rich quantitative articulatory data. The project is having broad impact through the free dissemination of the unique rtMRI data corpora, tools and models-already used worldwide for research and teaching-and societal out- reach through its website and lay media coverage. Understanding articulatory compositional structure and cross-linguistic potentialities also has critical translational significance impacting the assessment and remediation of speech disorders, as our collaborative work on glossectomy and apraxia has begun to demonstrate. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time imaging of the moving vocal tract with MRI has made direct movies of speech production possible, allowing an investigation of the articulatory composition of speech in healthy adults and illuminating the articulatory dissolution and lack of coherence often found in spoken language disorders. This technology platform, coupled with a linguistically driven theoretical framework that understands speech as composed of articulatory units, provides a scientific foothold for evidence-driven assessment and remediation of speech breakdown in clinical populations, including articulatory remediation and training and deploying assistive technologies for the impaired (automatic speech recognition, machine speech synthesis), and has potential broad impact on the clinical needs of those with swallowing disorders, sleep apnea, or facing recovery of speech function after stroke or surgery. Further, because speech presents the only example of rapid, cognitively- controlled, internal movements of the body, the unique challenges of speech production imaging offer the wider biomedical imaging community traction for advances that improve temporal and spatial image resolution-advances with potential import for cardiac and other imaging.",Dynamics of Vocal Tract Shaping,9390471,R01DC007124,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Apraxias', 'Articulation', 'Articulators', 'Beds', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Epiglottis structure', 'Event', 'German population', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Larynx', 'Lateral', 'Linguistics', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Pattern', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cohesion', 'computerized tools', 'constriction', 'dexterity', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'movie', 'novel', 'outreach', 'phonology', 'program dissemination', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'remediation', 'shape analysis', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech recognition', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'tongue apex', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,467515,0.3044822393919663
"Speech segregation to improve intelligility of reverberant-noisy speech Project Summary Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions, affecting 37.5 million Americans. Although signal amplification in modern hearing aids makes sound more audible to hearing impaired listeners, speech understanding in background interference remains the biggest challenge by hearing aid wearers. The proposed research seeks a monaural (one-microphone) solution to this challenge by developing supervised speech segregation based on deep learning. Unlike traditional speech enhancement, deep learning based speech segregation is driven by training data, and three components of a deep neural network (DNN) model are features, training targets, and network architectures. Recently, deep learning has achieved tremendous successes in a variety of real world applications. Our approach builds on the progress made in the PI's previous R01 project which demonstrated, for the first time, substantial speech intelligibility improvements for hearing-impaired listeners in noise. A main focus of the proposed work in this cycle is to combat room reverberation in addition to background interference. The proposed work is designed to achieve three specific aims. The first aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant-noisy speech for hearing- impaired listeners. To achieve this aim, we will train DNNs to perform time-frequency masking. The second aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant speech in the presence of competing speech. To achieve this aim, we will perform DNN training to estimate two ideal masks, one for the target talker and the other for the interfering talker. The third aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant speech in combined speech and nonspeech interference. To achieve this aim, we will develop a two-stage DNN model where the first stage will be trained to remove nonspeech interference and the second stage to remove interfering speech. Eight speech intelligibility experiments involving both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners will be conducted to systematically evaluate the developed system. The proposed project is expected to substantially close the speech intelligibility gap between hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners in daily conditions, with the ultimate goal of removing the gap altogether. Relevance A widely acknowledged deficit of hearing loss is reduced intelligibility of reverberant-noisy speech. How to improve speech intelligibility of hearing impaired listeners in everyday environments is a major technical challenge. This project directly addresses this challenge and the results from the project are expected to yield technical methods that can be translated to hearing prosthesis, potentially benefiting millions of individuals with hearing loss.",Speech segregation to improve intelligility of reverberant-noisy speech,9443223,R01DC012048,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Auditory', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network architecture', 'real world application', 'segregation', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'success']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,292174,0.301781823836354
"Objectively Quantifying Speech Outcomes of Children with Cleft Palate Perceptual assessment of hypernasality is considered a critical component when evaluating the speech of children with cleft lip and/or palate (CLP). However, most speech-language pathologists (SLPs) do not receive formal training for perceptual evaluation of speech and, as a result, research shows that the subjective ratings are inherently biased to the perceiver and exhibit considerable variability. In this project, we aim to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that automatically evaluates speech along four dimensions deemed to be critically important by the Americleft Speech Outcomes Group (ASOG), namely speech acceptability, articulation, hypernasality, and audible nasal emissions. The AI algorithm in this project is based on an existing database of speech collected as a part of an NIH-funded project to develop reliable speech outcomes by improving the reliability of perceptual ratings by training clinicians (NIDCR DE019-01235, PI: Kathy Chapman). This database contains speech samples from 125 5-7 year olds along with multiple perceptual rating for each speech sample. The clinicians participating in this study were successfully trained using a new protocol from the Americleft Speech Outcomes Group and they exhibit excellent inter-clinician reliability.  In SA1 we will develop an AI algorithm that automatically learns the relationship between a comprehensive set of speech acoustics and the average of the ASOG-trained expert ratings for each of the four perceptual dimensions. This approach is based on technology that the PIs have successfully used to evaluate dysarthric speech. Unique to these algorithms is modeling of perceptual judgments of trained experts using tools from statistical signal processing and AI. The output of the algorithms will map to a clinically- relevant scale, rather than to norm-referenced values that may or may not be meaningful. In SA2, we will evaluate the tool on new data by collecting new speech samples using a mobile app at a partner clinic using the same protocol as in the original study. Every collected sample will be further evaluated by ASOG trained clinicians. We will use this data to evaluate the accuracy of the AI model by comparing the model's predictions with the average of ASOG-trained experts. Preliminary results show promise that the proposed approach will yield a successful tool for accurately characterizing perceptual dimensions in the speech of children with CLP. These results indicate that a number of acoustic features that have been developed previously by the PIs accurately capture differences in hypernasality and articulation between the speech of three children with CLP (with varying severity). Furthermore, we show the success of our approach on a different, but related, task: objective evaluation of dysarthric speech. We show that an algorithm that automatically rates hypernasality performs on par with the judgment of human evaluators. The results of the proposed research will form the basis for a subsequent R01 proposal for the development and evaluation of a clinical tool to objectively quantify and track speech production in children with CLP. Project Narrative Perceptual assessment of the speech of children with cleft lip and/or palate is commonly used as a key clinical indicator upon which follow-on decisions are made about intervention. However, studies show that the inter- clinician reliability can be low. As an alternative, we propose a new objective outcome tool based on signal processing and artificial intelligence that automatically assesses speech acceptability, articulation, hypernasality, and audible nasal emissions directly from speech; the output of the tool is on a scale defined by the Americleft Speech Outcomes Group and can be used by clinicians to objectively measure progress.",Objectively Quantifying Speech Outcomes of Children with Cleft Palate,9601604,R21DE026252,"['7 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Articulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft Palate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ear', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Four-dimensional', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Palate', 'Pathologist', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Reference Values', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Disorders', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cleft lip and palate', 'clinically relevant', 'craniofacial', 'impression', 'improved outcome', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2018,203708,0.32591918276628695
"Neurophysiology of robust speech perception in human superior temporal gyrus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Perceiving and following an individual speaker in a crowded, noisy environment is a commonplace task for listeners with normal hearing. The underlying neurophysiology, however, is complex, and the task remains a struggle for people with peripheral and central auditory pathway disorders. The lack of a detailed neurobiological model of mechanisms and functions underlying robust speech perception has hindered our understanding of how these processes become impaired in the suffering population. In our innovative approach, we will record from high-density micro and macro electrode arrays surgically implanted on the superior temporal gyrus of epilepsy patients as part of their clinical evaluation. This method offers an exceptionally detailed perspective of cortical population activity. We will build upon two recent complementary findings where we identified a highly selective, spatially distributed neural representation of phonetic features (Mesgarani et. al. Science, 2014), which at the same time is highly dynamic and can change rapidly to reflect the perceptual bias of the listener (Mesgarani & Chang, Nature 2012). While significant, these studies revealed several gaps in our understanding of this process, which we intend to address in this proposal. Specifically, we will resolve the following unanswered questions: 1) what is the neural mechanism for joint encoding of both phonetic and speaker features? 2) How does attention modulate phonetic and speaker feature selectivity of neural responses? And 3) what computational mechanisms can account for dynamic feature selectivity of responses in STG? Answering these questions will significantly advance our understanding of a remarkable human ability, and will be of great interest to researchers from many areas including neurologists, and sensory and cognitive neuroscientists. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the mechanisms underlying speech perception in challenging environments is a crucial step in determining how these processes deteriorate in various disorders of peripheral and central auditory pathways. Our studies will result in novel neurobiological models of robust speech perception that will serve as a necessary step toward designing innovative therapeutic measures.",Neurophysiology of robust speech perception in human superior temporal gyrus,9444452,R01DC014279,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathology', 'Speech Perception', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Voice', 'Work', 'attentional modulation', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive ability', 'computer framework', 'density', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'selective attention', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2018,397659,0.12471153486932793
"Perception of dysarthric speech: An objective model of dysarthric speech evaluation with actionable outcomes The trained ear of the speech-language pathologist is the gold standard assessment tool for clinical practice in motor speech disorders. However, perceptual judgments are vulnerable to bias and their relationship with estimates of listener intelligibility â the final arbiter of speech goodness â is indeterminate. Interpretable, objective, and robust outcome measures that provide targets for treatment are urgently needed in order to provide more precise care and reliably monitor patient progress. Based on theoretical models of speech perception, in our previous grants we have developed a novel set of outcome measures that provide a multi- dimensional intelligibility profile (MIP) by using custom speech stimuli and a new coding strategy that allows us to capture the types of errors that listeners make when listening to dysarthric speech. This has led to a more complete intelligibility profile that codifies these errors at different levels of granularity, from global to discrete. Simultaneously, we have also developed a computational model for evaluation of dysarthric speech capable of reliably estimating a limited set of intelligibility measures directly from the speech acoustics. To date, both the outcome measures and the objective model have been evaluated on cross-sectional data only. In this renewal application, our principal goal is to evaluate specific hypotheses regarding expected changes in this multidimensional intelligibility profile as a result of different intervention instruction conditions (loud, clear, slow). A secondary goal of the proposal is to further refine our objective model to predict the complete intelligibility profile and to evaluate its ability to detect intelligibility changes within individual speakers. This is critical for clinicians who currently have no objective ways to assess the value of their interventions. With the aim of improving the standard of care through technology, the long-term goal of this proposal is to develop stand-alone objective outcome measures for dysarthria that can provide clinicians with reliable treatment targets. Such applications have the potential to dramatically alter the current standard of care in speech pathology for patients with neurological disease or injury. Furthermore, these applications also have the potential to reduce health disparities by partially automating clinical intervention and providing easier access to these services to those in remote areas or in underdeveloped countries. Â  There is an urgent need in the field of speech-language pathology for objective outcome measures of speech intelligibility that provide clinicians with actionable information regarding treatment targets. This proposal seeks to leverage theoretical advances in speech intelligibility to evaluate the sensitivity of a novel multidimensional intelligibility profile that quantifies the perceptual effects of speech change. Using listener transcriptions of dysarthric speech, along with a suite of automated acoustic metrics, the predictive model uses machine-learning algorithms to learn the relationship between speech acoustics and listener percepts. Ultimately, this model will allow clinicians to predict the outcomes of an intervention strategy to assess its utility for a patient. This has the potential to dramatically alter the current standard of care in speech pathology for patients with neurological disease or injury.",Perception of dysarthric speech: An objective model of dysarthric speech evaluation with actionable outcomes,9432492,R01DC006859,"['Acoustics', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysarthria', 'Ear', 'Educational Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathologist', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Pathology', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech-Language Pathology', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'lexical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'signal processing', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDCD,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2018,310124,0.3108439132585689
"NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF OPTIMAL MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Speech perception is one of the most important cognitive operations performed by the human brain and is fundamentally multisensory: when conversing with someone, we use both visual information from their face and auditory information from their voice. Multisensory speech perception is especially important when the auditory component of the speech is noisy, either due to a hearing disorder or normal aging. However, much less is known about the neural computations underlying visual speech perception than about those underlying auditory speech perception. To remedy this gap in existing knowledge, we will use converging evidence from two complementary measures of brain activity, BOLD fMRI and electrocorticography (ECoG). The results of these neural recording studies will be interpreted in the context of a flexible computational model based on the emerging tenet that the brain performs multisensory integration using optimal or Bayesian inference, combining the currently available sensory information with prior experience.  In the first Aim, a Bayesian model will be constructed to explain individual differences in multisensory speech perception along three axes: subjects' ability to understand noisy audiovisual speech; subjects' susceptibility to the McGurk effect, a multisensory illusion; and the time spent fixating the mouth of a talking face.  In the second Aim, we will explore the neural encoding of visual speech using voxel-wise forward encoding models of the BOLD fMRI signal. We will develop encoding models to test 7 different theories of visual speech representation from the linguistic and computer vision literature. In the third Aim, we will use ECoG to examine the neural computations for integrating visual and auditory speech, guided by the Bayesian models developed in Aim 1. First, we will study reduced neural variability for multisensory speech predicted by our model. Second, we will study the representational space of unisensory and multisensory speech. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding speech is one of the most important functions of the human brain. We use information from both the auditory modality (the voice of the person we are talking to) and the visual modality (the facial movements of the person we are talking to) to understand speech. We will use computational models, eye tracking, and brain imaging and recording techniques to study the organization and operation of the brain during audiovisual speech perception.",NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF OPTIMAL MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION,9416174,R01NS065395,"['Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oral cavity', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'audiovisual speech', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'hearing impairment', 'multisensory', 'neural model', 'normal aging', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'speech accuracy', 'theories', 'visual information', 'visual speech']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,346719,0.2855438796579336
"Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder. ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decades, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a range of cognitive processes in an effort to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subtle thought disorder, manifest in disturbance of language production, is a feature that predates rather than follows, psychosis onset in CHR individuals, and therefore may be an indicator of schizophrenia liability. Subtle thought disorder in schizophrenia and its risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. Here, we propose to instead use a novel automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language. It also evaluates syntax through ""part-of-speech"" tagging. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture subtle thought disorder and discriminate psychosis outcome among CHR individuals. Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we were able to identify a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort at Columbia, which included semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, shortened phrase length, and decreased use of determiner pronouns (""which"", ""what"", ""that""). These features were correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in terms of classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. While promising, these automated methods of analysis require validation in a second CHR cohort. In this proposal, in collaboration with IBM, we will validate these automated methods using a large archive of speech data from the UCLA CHR cohort. This dataset has several advantages. First, the UCLA CHR cohort has a high prevalence of psychosis transition, important as machine learning is sensitive to group size. Second, it has undergone prior manual linguistic analysis, identifying features of language production that predicted psychosis outcome; hence, automated and manual methods can be directly compared. Third, there are speech data available from healthy controls and recent-onset psychosis patients (for validation). Fourth, several participants have multiple speech assays (such that stability of the classifier can be examined). Beyond validation of methods, we will maximize group size and combine speech data from Columbia and UCLA to characterize a common classifier of psychosis outcome. Automated methods for language analysis may improve prediction of psychosis onset and inform remediation strategies for its prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Subtle thought disorder is an early core feature of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset: it has traditionally been evaluated using clinical ratings or labor-intensive manual linguistic analyses. This proposal will apply novel computer-based speech analysis methods to existing datasets to identify abnormal semantic and syntactic features of language production that can predict or classify psychosis outcome among youths at clinical high risk for psychosis. Improved characterization of thought disorder can inform targeted preventive interventions for young people at risk for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, so as to reduce the morbidity of psychosis.",Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder.,9231498,R03MH108933,"['Address', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Friends', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'disabling symptom', 'effective intervention', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'standard of care', 'syntax', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R03,2017,35453,0.17230174764759432
"Using Machine Learning to Mitigate Reverberation Effects in Cochlear Implants ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cochlear implants (CIs) provide hearing for over 200,000 recipients worldwide {NIDCD, 2011 #637}. These devices successfully provide high levels of speech understanding in quiet listening conditions; however, more challenging conditions degrade speech comprehension for CI recipients to a much greater degree than for normal hearing listeners {Kokkinakis, 2011 #673;Nelson, 2003 #302}. CI listeners are especially affected by reverberant conditions with even a small level of reverberation degrading comprehension to a greater degree than a large amount of steady-state noise {Hazrati, 2012 #674}. Thus, a method that mitigates the effects of reverberation has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for CI users. Previous attempts to solve the problem of speech in reverberation for cochlear implants have not been able to be implemented in real time. Our preliminary results suggest that successful mitigation of overlap masking can result in a substantial improvement in speech recognition even if self-masking is not mitigated and we have devised an approach that can be implemented in real time. In the proposed effort, we will first improve the classifier to detect reverberation based on our successful preliminary efforts. Next we will assess the mitigation algorithm, first in normal hearing listeners and then in listeners with cochlear implants. Finally, we will implement the algorithm in real time and again test it. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While cochlear implants (CIs) provide high levels of speech comprehension in quiet for over 200,000 profoundly deaf individuals worldwide, speech in quiet scenarios are rarely encountered outside of the home. The presence of noise or reverberation in the listening environment decreases speech comprehension for CI users much more rapidly than for normal-hearing listeners, and of these two conditions, reverberation has a greater negative impact. The proposed research aims to provide a robust reverberation mitigation algorithm for CI speech processors thereby improving the ability of CI users to interact in real-world listening environments.",Using Machine Learning to Mitigate Reverberation Effects in Cochlear Implants,9305035,R01DC014290,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Categories', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Comprehension', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Frequencies', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'success']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,293476,0.2612885595838641
"Automated Speech Analysis: A Marker of Drug Intoxication & Treatment Outcome ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major limitation of existing assessments of clinically-relevant mental states related to drug use, abuse, and treatment is that self-report measures rely on the capacity and motivation to accurately report one's internal experiences. A potential alternative is presented by emerging computer-based natural language processing methods that can extract fine-grained semantic, structural, and syntactic features from free speech1, potentially providing a unique 'window into the mind.' These methods are widely used in industry2, yet remain largely unknown in clinical research. To begin to assess the potential of these advanced analytic methods in clinical research, we recently partnered with IBM computer science researchers to test computer-based analysis of speech semantic structure. In preliminary work, we were able to demonstrate that such methods could detect acute drug intoxication3 and accurately predicted the development of psychosis in clinical risk states4. Here, we propose to build on these highly promising initial findings, conducting three secondary data analyses to rapidly and cost-effectively advance this novel direction. Projects 1 and 2 will extend our preliminary work on speech markers of mental state changes during acute drug intoxication. In Project 1, we will assess speech semantic, structural, and syntactic features as markers of mental state changes due to MDMA (0, 0.75, 1.5 mg/kg; oral). In Project 2, we will extend these findings to another drug, assessing speech markers of intoxication with LSD (0, 70 Î¼g; intravenous). These projects are possible because we have access to existing transcripts of free speech from within-subject, controlled laboratory studies of the effects of MDMA (N = 77) and LSD (N = 19). Potential future uses for these methods could include rapid characterization of the effects of emerging drugs and, potentially, detection of acute drug intoxication in the absence of biochemical confirmation. Project 3 will assess the use of speech analysis as a prognostic marker in substance abuse treatment. Specifically, we will use speech transcripts (N = 50) from a currently ongoing study to assess whether features extracted from baseline free speech can predict treatment outcome in cocaine users undergoing 12 weeks of CBT relapse prevention. Self-report5,6 and manual coding of speech7-9 suggest that motivation to change may be a predictor of treatment outcome for substance use disorders: we expect that the fine-grained computational methods we will employ will allow the development of more accurate predictive models. The capacity to use automated methods to detect mental states from free speech has wide ranging, potentially transformative implications for addiction medicine and psychiatry more broadly4,10. Results of the proposed secondary analyses projects will efficiently advance understanding of how automated speech analysis, a non-invasive and cost- effective assessment method, could be used in clinical practice and research about drug abuse. More broadly, results may contribute to the empirical basis for the development of automated, objective, speech- based diagnostic and prognostic tests in psychiatry. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Free speech, a unique `window into the mind', represents a rich source of information that can be mined for clinically-relevant information. This application proposes to apply novel computer science speech analysis methods in three secondary data analysis projects to investigate 1) speech markers of mental states during acute drug intoxication; and 2) speech as a prognostic marker in cognitive behavioral treatment for drug abuse. Results will rapidly and cost-effectively advance understanding of how automated speech analysis could be used in clinical practice and research about drug use, abuse, and treatment.",Automated Speech Analysis: A Marker of Drug Intoxication & Treatment Outcome,9232130,R03DA040855,"['Acute', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Bypass', 'Cereals', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Abuse', 'Cocaine Users', 'Code', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intoxication', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Lysergic Acid Diethylamide', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Placebos', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cocaine use', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'ecstasy', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mental state', 'natural language', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic assays', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'secondary analysis', 'substance abuse treatment', 'syntax']",NIDA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R03,2017,81000,0.23233926888549314
"Subthalamic and corticosubthalamic coding of speech production Speech production and control is disrupted in a number of neurological diseases that involve the basal ganglia. Notably, hypophonia and hypokinetic dysarthria (characterized by decreased motor gain) are prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) produces predictable improvements in other motor symptoms of PD but does not result in consistent improvement in speech and can negatively impact language function. These observations and other accumulating evidence indicate an important role for the basal ganglia in speech. However, a major impediment to developing treatments for speech deficits in movement disorders and reducing speech-related side effects of DBS is the absence of a neurophysiological model for basal ganglia participation in speech production. Testing how general tenets of basal ganglia organization and function apply to the speech motor system presents both unique challenges for clinical neuroscientists and significant opportunities to advance the cognitive neuroscience of speech production. Our overall goals are to determine how motor and linguistic speech information is encoded at multiple levels of granularity within the STN-cortical network, and to determine the relationship between neural activity within the STN-cortical network and the gain of vocal output. Despite the fact that electrophysiological data obtained during DBS surgery offers the unique opportunity to directly assess basal ganglia neuronal activity during speech, this paradigm remains remarkably unexplored. Our central hypothesis is that the STN contributes at multiple levels to the hierarchical control of speech production. Using a completely novel approach, we will rigorously test this hypothesis by simultaneously recording STN units, STN and cortical local field potentials (LFP), and spoken acoustics while PD subjects perform a speech task during DBS surgery. To test for encoding at different levels of granularity, we will explore the extent to which neuronal activity in the STN codes for articulatory and linguistic features associated with different levels of representation within the speech production system (Aim 1). To test for a role in voice modulation, we will explore the extent to which the STN codes for measures of gain, such as volume, pitch and fluency (Aim 2). Additionally, we will directly assess the causal role of STN function in speech production by delivering disruptive stimulation to the STN (Aim 3). A major strength of our project is the complimentary nature of extensive, multi-disciplinary expertise from team members at the University of Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins University and Carnegie Mellon University. This combined expertise allows us to employ a novel combination of classical analytic methods and more recent machine learning methods for supervised and exploratory analyses to document the neural dynamics of STN and cortical activity during speech production. Speech production and control is disrupted in a number of neurological diseases that involve the basal ganglia, for instance hypophonia and hypokinetic dysarthria are prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We will use a novel experimental approach and combination of analytic techniques to elucidate the contribution of neural activity in the subthalamic nucleus to the hierarchical control of speech production, in subjects with PD undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery.",Subthalamic and corticosubthalamic coding of speech production,9355730,U01NS098969,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dysarthria', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Production', 'Role', 'STN stimulation', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'gain of function', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'microstimulation', 'motor symptom', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'response']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2017,900000,0.2991315128163392
"Speech Movement Classification for Assessing and Treating ALS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is advance the assessment and treatment of speech motor impairments due to ALS using novel computer-based approaches. Recently developed speech movement tracking technology will be used to record movements of tongue, lips, and jaw in 50 persons with ALS and 50 healthy control participants. The speech movement data will be analyzed using custom machine learning algorithms to address three important translational needs in person with ALS: improved early detection of speech motor involvement, improved progress monitoring of speech motor decline, and improved options for maintaining oral communication. The established interdisciplinary team with expertise in data mining, speech- language pathology, clinical neurology, and spatial statistics are well positioned to conduct this research. If successful, the specific aims have the potential to transform clinical practice for speech-language pathologists, neurologists, and other related health care professionals. The propose research will enhance human health by making an impact on individuals with speech motor impairment due to ALS and potentially to a broad range of other speech motor due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, and orofacial or laryngeal cancer.

"Prolonging Functional Speech in Persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Real-Time Virtual Vocal Tract People with ALS eventually and inevitably experience serious speech impairment due to progressive deterioration of brain cells that control movements of the tongue, lips and jaw. Despite the devastating consequences of this speech impairment on quality of life and survival, few options are available to assist impaired oral communication, and many existing speech-generating technologies are slow to operate and cost prohibitive. This project seeks to improve quality of life for persons with impaired speech due to ALS by testing the effectiveness of a low-cost, speech-generating device (a virtual vocal tract) that could significantly prolong the ability of these patients to communicate orally. If successful, these techniques could be extended for use by patients' with a broad range of speech motor impairments. The virtual vocal track uses machine learning algorithms to predict what a person is attempting to say, in real-time, based solely on lip movements. Users of the device are able to trigger the playback of a number of predetermined phrases by simply attempting to articulate what they want to say. Our previous work has shown the feasibility of this approach using cost-prohibitive laboratory systems such as electromagnetic articulography. Recent advances in 3D depth mapping camera technology allow these techniques to be tested for the first time using technologies, which are low-cost, portable and already being integrated into consumer devices such as laptops and cellphones. To this end, the system under development will be tested in 60 patients with ALS, representing a range of speech impairment from normal to severe speech intelligibility (15 normal, 15 mild, 15 moderate, 15 severe). During testing, participants will be cued to articulate the phrases in a random order as fast as is comfortable for them. The entire session will be recorded and the following variables will be measured offline: recognition accuracy, recognition latency, task time, % completion, and communication rate (words per minute). Users will rate the usability and acceptability of the virtual vocal tract immediately following device testing, using the System Usability Scale. Results of this testing will be used to address the following specific aims: (1) Determine the accuracy and latency of real-time phrase synthesis based on dysarthric speech using the virtual vocal tract, (2) Determine the usability and acceptability of real-time phrases produced using the virtual vocal tract, and (3) Identify the articulatory and speech factors that degrade recognition accuracy. People with ALS eventually and inevitably experience serious speech impairment due to progressive bulbar motor deterioration. Despite the devastating consequences of this impairment to quality of life, few options are available to assist or prolong impaired oral communication. The goal of the proposed work is to lay the groundwork for development of a low-cost speech-generating deviceâa virtual vocal tractâthat can prolong functional oral communication for people with bulbar motor deterioration. This project seeks to testing the efficacy of a low-cost, speech-generating device (a virtual vocal tract) that records lip movements in real-time and triggers the playback of prerecorded phrases as users articulate what they want to say. If successful, the virtual device could provide an alternative means of oral communication for the large number of persons with unintelligible speech but still able to move their oral structures.",Prolonging Functional Speech in Persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Real-Time Virtual Vocal Tract,9370414,K24DC016312,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Articulation', 'Articulators', 'Bypass', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dysarthria', 'Effectiveness', 'Electromagnetics', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Oral', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Sound', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'clear speech', 'cost', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'jaw movement', 'laptop', 'motor impairment', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'orofacial', 'phrases', 'portability', 'spatiotemporal', 'time use', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,K24,2017,189841,0.2799142069615122
"Functional Architecture of Speech Motor Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Speaking is one of the most complex actions that we perform, yet nearly all of us learn do it effortlessly. The ability to communicate through speech is often described as the unique and defining trait of human behavior. Despite its importance, the basic neural mechanisms that govern our ability to speak fluently remain unresolved. This proposal addresses two fundamental questions at the crossroads of linguistics, systems neuroscience, and biomedical engineering: 1) How are the kinematic and acoustic targets of articulation represented in human speech motor cortex?, 2) What are the coordinated patterns of cortical activation that gives rise to fluent, continuous speech?, and 3) How does prefrontal cortex govern the cognitive inhibitory control of speech (e.g. stopping)? Our studies should greatly advance understanding of how the speech motor cortex encodes the precise control of articulation during speech production as well as determine whether this control system can be harnessed for novel rehabilitative strategies. Three potential areas of impact are: Neurobiology of Language, where results will shed light on neurophysiologic mechanisms of speech motor control; Human Neurophysiology, where insight gained may suggest novel methods for machine learning-based analyses of distributed population neural activity; and Translational NeuroEngineering, where utilization of novel cortical recording technologies at unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution and duration. We propose to investigate the functional organization of the speech motor cortex during controlled vowel and syllable productions, but also from natural, continuous speech. Our methods utilizing safe, high-density, large-scale intracranial electrode recordings in humans represent a significant advancement over current noninvasive neuroimaging approaches. To accomplish this, we must innovate new, integrative approaches to speech motor control research. We have assembled a team with significant multi- disciplinary strengths in neurosurgery, neurology, ethics, computational modeling, machine learning, neuroscience, engineering, and linguistics. The most debilitating aspect of profound paralysis due to trauma, stroke, or disease is loss of the ability to speak, which leads to profound social isolation. Our research leverages foundational knowledge gained during research piloted under a NIH New Innovator (DP2) award. We wish to broaden the impact of our research in the neurobiology of speech motor control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Discovering the neural mechanisms of speech production has major implications for understanding a large number of communication disorders including mutism, stuttering, apraxia of speech, and aphasia.

"Dynamics of Vocal Tract Shaping ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to wed state-of-the-art technology for imaging the vocal tract with a linguistically informed analysis of dynamic vocal tract constriction actions in order to understand the control and production of the compositional units of spoken language. We have pioneered the use of real time MRI for speech imaging to illuminate articulatory dynamics and to understand how these emerge lawfully from the combined effects of vocal tract constriction events distributed over space (subparts of the tract) and over time. This project has developed and refined a novel real time MRI acquisition ability, making possible current reconstruction rates of up to 96 frames per second, quadrupling current imaging speeds. Data show clear real- time movements of the lips, tongue, velum and epiglottis, providing exquisite information about the spatiotemporal properties of speech gestures in both the oral and pharyngeal portions of the vocal tract. The project has also developed novel noise-mitigated image-synchronized strategies to record speech in-situ during imaging, as well as image processing strategies for deriving linguistically meaningful measures from the data, demon- strating the utility of this approach for linguistic studies of speech communication in a variety of languages. Using our direct access to dynamic information on vocal tract shaping, we investigate vocal tract shaping in three-dimensions as the composition of spatiotemporally coordinated vocal tract action units. This project's specific aims go beyond the dynamic shaping of individual vowels and consonants-postures over time-to examine more complex structuring of articulation-namely, the local and global influences governing linguistic control, temporal coherence and multi-unit coordination. The advances in our technical approach enable a series of studies that leverage: (i) unprecedented high-speech imaging with dynamic rtMRI to consider the prosodic modulation of temporally rapid and temporally coherent speech units; (ii) innovative multi-plane 3D imaging capability to inform the computational identification of linguistic control regimes; and (iii) a large- scale rtMRI corpus ad concomitant machine learning advances to move toward a principled account of system-level co-variability in space and time, both within and among individuals. This symbiotic theory-driven and data-driven research strategy will yield significant innovations in understanding spoken communication. It is no exaggeration to say that the advent of real-time MRI for speech has initiated a dramatic scientific change in the nature of speech production research by allowing for models of production driven by rich quantitative articulatory data. The project is having broad impact through the free dissemination of the unique rtMRI data corpora, tools and models-already used worldwide for research and teaching-and societal out- reach through its website and lay media coverage. Understanding articulatory compositional structure and cross-linguistic potentialities also has critical translational significance impacting the assessment and remediation of speech disorders, as our collaborative work on glossectomy and apraxia has begun to demonstrate. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time imaging of the moving vocal tract with MRI has made direct movies of speech production possible, allowing an investigation of the articulatory composition of speech in healthy adults and illuminating the articulatory dissolution and lack of coherence often found in spoken language disorders. This technology platform, coupled with a linguistically driven theoretical framework that understands speech as composed of articulatory units, provides a scientific foothold for evidence-driven assessment and remediation of speech breakdown in clinical populations, including articulatory remediation and training and deploying assistive technologies for the impaired (automatic speech recognition, machine speech synthesis), and has potential broad impact on the clinical needs of those with swallowing disorders, sleep apnea, or facing recovery of speech function after stroke or surgery. Further, because speech presents the only example of rapid, cognitively- controlled, internal movements of the body, the unique challenges of speech production imaging offer the wider biomedical imaging community traction for advances that improve temporal and spatial image resolution-advances with potential import for cardiac and other imaging.",Dynamics of Vocal Tract Shaping,9177754,R01DC007124,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Apraxias', 'Articulation', 'Articulators', 'Beds', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Epiglottis structure', 'Event', 'German population', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Larynx', 'Lateral', 'Linguistics', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Pattern', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cognitive control', 'cohesion', 'computerized tools', 'constriction', 'dexterity', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'movie', 'novel', 'outreach', 'phonology', 'program dissemination', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'remediation', 'shape analysis', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech recognition', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'tongue apex', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,433810,0.3044822393919663
"Real-Time Articulation-to-Speech Mapping for Enhancing Impaired Oral Communication ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of a silent speech interface (SSI) as an alternative mode of oral communication for persons who are unable to use their voice (e.g., after laryngectomy, surgical removal of larynx due to the treatment of cancer). We have recently developed a real-time, interactive SSI based on a commercial electromagnetic articulograph. The SSI converts tongue and lip movement to text, and then plays back corresponding synthesized speech sounds with natural sounding voice in real-time. The SSI has potential to restore the patient's voice by identifying the patient's voice characteristics before laryngectomy. Preliminary tests on healthy participants demonstrated the feasibility of the SSI. In this project, we further evaluate the system by studying 15 participants after laryngectomy and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. If successful, the SSI has the potential to transform clinical practice for speech-language pathologists other related health care professionals. The proposed research will enhance human health by making an impact on individuals after laryngectomy and potentially to a broad range of other speech and voice disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Silent speech interfaces (SSIs) are a novel alternative mode of oral communication for persons who are unable to produce speech sounds (e.g., individuals who undergo a laryngectomy, removal of larynx due to the treatment of laryngeal cancer). SSIs recognize speech sounds from articulatory data and then drive text-to-speech synthesis, which produces speech with natural sounding voice, which is one of the advantages over the current treatment options for these individuals. SSIs hold potential to even restore the patient's own voice by identifying the patient's voice characteristics before laryngectomy. Although participants after laryngectomy will be the test case in this project, the clinical implications of SSIs extend to a larger population of persons with other speech and voice disorders.",Real-Time Articulation-to-Speech Mapping for Enhancing Impaired Oral Communication,9319226,R03DC013990,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Articulation', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetics', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Laryngeal Prosthesis', 'Laryngectomy', 'Larynx', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Research', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Tracheoesophageal Speech', 'United States', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'kinematics', 'movement analysis', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'public health relevance', 'sound']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R03,2017,153000,0.30320896376225925
"Multi-Measure Speech Perception in Noise (MMSPIN) Chart: More Scores, Fewer Tests Project summary. This Phase I will establish the feasibility of increasing audiological diagnostic information by carrying out word- and phoneme-level analyses of open set responses during speech audiometry and by obtaining subjective hearing measures. Speech audiometry is used in characterizing functional hearing in settings of hearing screening, diagnosis, hearing aid fitting, counseling, aural rehabilitation/training, occupational fitness, and research. A typical procedure used with word and sentence tests in background noise is to ask the client/patient to repeat back what was just said (i.e., give an open set response). Responses are then scored in terms of words or keywords correct/incorrect. This method discards potentially diagnostic information in response errors, because noise can reveal systematic phonetic feature or phoneme confusions, and with background babble, intrusions from the babble. Other response patterns attributable to cognitive or memory declines may manifest in the paucity or verbosity of response words. Specific types of phoneme perception errors are thought to be associated with extent and configuration of hearing loss; and different types of noise maskers (i.e., energetic and informational maskers) present different types of perceptual problems that vary in severity across individuals. In order to utilize response errors, computational methods are needed to establish their relationships to the stimulus. This is because response errors may incorporate incorrect stimulus-to-response phoneme substitutions, as well as insertions or deletions of phonemes or words relative to the stimulus. We have developed sequence alignment methods to mine errors during speech audiometry, which we propose to evaluate using our system (Multi-Measure SPIN Chart: MMSPIN Chart). MMSPIN chart will be further developed and installed in the George Washington University Speech & Hearing Center (Aim 1). Audiologists will use the system during QuickSin sentence and NU-6 word testing with 200 clients (18-85 years of age) who give permission to access their entire clinic records (Aim 2). Their conventional speech audiometry will be augmented by obtaining subjective hearing accuracy judgments and hearing self-efficacy measures. These subjective judgments are designed to expose discrepancies with objective performance and to reveal individual differences in social cognition associated with hearing loss, both of which may account for the large individual differences in performance and intervention outcomes not accounted for by the audiogram. Evaluation of results in Aim 3 will include developing group and individual profile models comprising objective and subjective clinical data. With our clinician partners, we will develop formats for communicating MMSPIN Chart results to clients. In Aim 4, we will present results in a public lecture for audiologists and solicit opinions about how our new results may best impact clinical practice. Our approach can deliver more informative and efficient speech audiometry using existing test materials and can pave the way to more sensitive speech audiometry, including tests that are adaptive to specific levels of speech processing difficulty. Narrative. The typical approach to speech audiometry is to elicit open set responses that are scored in terms of words/keywords correct, discarding information in response errors. This Phase I will establish the feasibility of increasing diagnostic information provided to audiologists by carrying out word- and phoneme-level analyses of open set responses and obtaining subjective hearing measures in conjunction with speech audiometry. The goal is to improve clinical efficiency and effectiveness and to improve patient outcomes.","Multi-Measure Speech Perception in Noise (MMSPIN) Chart: More Scores, Fewer Tests",9408539,R43DC015749,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Attitude to Health', 'Audiometry', 'Authorization documentation', 'Back', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Factor Analysis', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Pure-Tone Audiometry', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Audiometry', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Voice', 'Washington', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'comparison group', 'data modeling', 'design', 'fitness', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing screening', 'improved', 'lectures', 'permissiveness', 'phonology', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'social cognition', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'touchscreen']",NIDCD,"SEEHEAR, LLC",R43,2017,147919,0.2278884456895544
"Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research Abstract: Researchers rely upon the lesion method to evaluate the speech-language status of stroke survivors and draw inferences about underlying brain function. This use of neuropsychology is highly valued in basic speech- language research because it can support causal inferences about brain structure/function relationships. Crucially, advances in analytic techniques and brain image computing are creating a new landscape for neuropsychological research. In this new landscape, the lesion method represents a form of big-data science that requires large sample sizes and complex image computing to implement lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) across the entire brain, without prior regions of interest. Expertise in these new techniques is becoming critical for high impact speech-language research. The career enhancement plan will provide the candidate with training in cutting-edge LSM. The candidate is an established speech-language investigator with a basic program of multidisciplinary research that includes populations with communication disorders due to stroke. The career enhancement will come at an ideal point, because it will build on the candidate's success in establishing an open-access research registry of stroke survivors (the Western Pennsylvania Patient Registry, WPPR), and current work to develop and validate collaborative videoconferencing for remote neuropsychological assessment. These efforts have created the recruitment pool and datasets that are needed for LSM. The career enhancement will provide the training needed to leverage these resources, thereby augmenting the candidate's program of research and career trajectory. The overarching objectives are to: (1) retool the skills of the candidate to infuse LSM into her program of speech-language research, (2) seed data sharing and data science partnerships to boost the candidate's leadership of WPPR as a national resource, and (3) advance understanding of LSM methods and the neural substrates for speech and language to improve the knowledge base of the candidate and other investigators. The candidate proposes a synergistic set of activities. Didactic activities will give training in machie learning and brain image computing, scholarly travel experiences will afford opportunities to network with speech-language researchers and data scientists whose work is relevant for LSM, and two research studies will provide a hands-on opportunity for the candidate to acquire, apply, and extend LSM methods under the guidance of a superb mentoring team. Study 1 will use univariate and multivariate LSM analysis to investigate the neural substrates of chronic Broca's aphasia and the factors that influence the reproducibility of LSM results. Study 2 will develop and evaluate a workflow for automated lesion segmentation, using a software platform (3D Slicer) that involves two NIH-supported data science centers. Overall, the career enhancement will retool the skills, research network, and knowledge base of an established investigator, allowing the candidate to significantly augment her program of speech-language research and advance the utility of WPPR as a national resource for speech-language research.

"Neurophysiology of robust speech perception in human superior temporal gyrus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Perceiving and following an individual speaker in a crowded, noisy environment is a commonplace task for listeners with normal hearing. The underlying neurophysiology, however, is complex, and the task remains a struggle for people with peripheral and central auditory pathway disorders. The lack of a detailed neurobiological model of mechanisms and functions underlying robust speech perception has hindered our understanding of how these processes become impaired in the suffering population. In our innovative approach, we will record from high-density micro and macro electrode arrays surgically implanted on the superior temporal gyrus of epilepsy patients as part of their clinical evaluation. This method offers an exceptionally detailed perspective of cortical population activity. We will build upon two recent complementary findings where we identified a highly selective, spatially distributed neural representation of phonetic features (Mesgarani et. al. Science, 2014), which at the same time is highly dynamic and can change rapidly to reflect the perceptual bias of the listener (Mesgarani & Chang, Nature 2012). While significant, these studies revealed several gaps in our understanding of this process, which we intend to address in this proposal. Specifically, we will resolve the following unanswered questions: 1) what is the neural mechanism for joint encoding of both phonetic and speaker features? 2) How does attention modulate phonetic and speaker feature selectivity of neural responses? And 3) what computational mechanisms can account for dynamic feature selectivity of responses in STG? Answering these questions will significantly advance our understanding of a remarkable human ability, and will be of great interest to researchers from many areas including neurologists, and sensory and cognitive neuroscientists. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the mechanisms underlying speech perception in challenging environments is a crucial step in determining how these processes deteriorate in various disorders of peripheral and central auditory pathways. Our studies will result in novel neurobiological models of robust speech perception that will serve as a necessary step toward designing innovative therapeutic measures.",Neurophysiology of robust speech perception in human superior temporal gyrus,9231432,R01DC014279,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathology', 'Speech Perception', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Voice', 'Work', 'attentional modulation', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive ability', 'computer framework', 'density', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'selective attention', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2017,396360,0.12471153486932793
"Perception of dysarthric speech: An objective model of dysarthric speech evaluation with actionable outcomes The trained ear of the speech-language pathologist is the gold standard assessment tool for clinical practice in motor speech disorders. However, perceptual judgments are vulnerable to bias and their relationship with estimates of listener intelligibility â the final arbiter of speech goodness â is indeterminate. Interpretable, objective, and robust outcome measures that provide targets for treatment are urgently needed in order to provide more precise care and reliably monitor patient progress. Based on theoretical models of speech perception, in our previous grants we have developed a novel set of outcome measures that provide a multi- dimensional intelligibility profile (MIP) by using custom speech stimuli and a new coding strategy that allows us to capture the types of errors that listeners make when listening to dysarthric speech. This has led to a more complete intelligibility profile that codifies these errors at different levels of granularity, from global to discrete. Simultaneously, we have also developed a computational model for evaluation of dysarthric speech capable of reliably estimating a limited set of intelligibility measures directly from the speech acoustics. To date, both the outcome measures and the objective model have been evaluated on cross-sectional data only. In this renewal application, our principal goal is to evaluate specific hypotheses regarding expected changes in this multidimensional intelligibility profile as a result of different intervention instruction conditions (loud, clear, slow). A secondary goal of the proposal is to further refine our objective model to predict the complete intelligibility profile and to evaluate its ability to detect intelligibility changes within individual speakers. This is critical for clinicians who currently have no objective ways to assess the value of their interventions. With the aim of improving the standard of care through technology, the long-term goal of this proposal is to develop stand-alone objective outcome measures for dysarthria that can provide clinicians with reliable treatment targets. Such applications have the potential to dramatically alter the current standard of care in speech pathology for patients with neurological disease or injury. Furthermore, these applications also have the potential to reduce health disparities by partially automating clinical intervention and providing easier access to these services to those in remote areas or in underdeveloped countries. Â  There is an urgent need in the field of speech-language pathology for objective outcome measures of speech intelligibility that provide clinicians with actionable information regarding treatment targets. This proposal seeks to leverage theoretical advances in speech intelligibility to evaluate the sensitivity of a novel multidimensional intelligibility profile that quantifies the perceptual effects of speech change. Using listener transcriptions of dysarthric speech, along with a suite of automated acoustic metrics, the predictive model uses machine-learning algorithms to learn the relationship between speech acoustics and listener percepts. Ultimately, this model will allow clinicians to predict the outcomes of an intervention strategy to assess its utility for a patient.

"NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF OPTIMAL MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Speech perception is one of the most important cognitive operations performed by the human brain and is fundamentally multisensory: when conversing with someone, we use both visual information from their face and auditory information from their voice. Multisensory speech perception is especially important when the auditory component of the speech is noisy, either due to a hearing disorder or normal aging. However, much less is known about the neural computations underlying visual speech perception than about those underlying auditory speech perception. To remedy this gap in existing knowledge, we will use converging evidence from two complementary measures of brain activity, BOLD fMRI and electrocorticography (ECoG). The results of these neural recording studies will be interpreted in the context of a flexible computational model based on the emerging tenet that the brain performs multisensory integration using optimal or Bayesian inference, combining the currently available sensory information with prior experience.  In the first Aim, a Bayesian model will be constructed to explain individual differences in multisensory speech perception along three axes: subjects' ability to understand noisy audiovisual speech; subjects' susceptibility to the McGurk effect, a multisensory illusion; and the time spent fixating the mouth of a talking face.  In the second Aim, we will explore the neural encoding of visual speech using voxel-wise forward encoding models of the BOLD fMRI signal. We will develop encoding models to test 7 different theories of visual speech representation from the linguistic and computer vision literature. In the third Aim, we will use ECoG to examine the neural computations for integrating visual and auditory speech, guided by the Bayesian models developed in Aim 1. First, we will study reduced neural variability for multisensory speech predicted by our model. Second, we will study the representational space of unisensory and multisensory speech. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding speech is one of the most important functions of the human brain. We use information from both the auditory modality (the voice of the person we are talking to) and the visual modality (the facial movements of the person we are talking to) to understand speech. We will use computational models, eye tracking, and brain imaging and recording techniques to study the organization and operation of the brain during audiovisual speech perception.",NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF OPTIMAL MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION,9197698,R01NS065395,"['Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Employee Strikes', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oral cavity', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'audiovisual speech', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'hearing impairment', 'multisensory', 'neural model', 'normal aging', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'speech accuracy', 'theories', 'visual information', 'visual speech']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,346719,0.2855438796579336
"Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder. ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decades, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a range of cognitive processes in an effort to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subtle thought disorder, manifest in disturbance of language production, is a feature that predates rather than follows, psychosis onset in CHR individuals, and therefore may be an indicator of schizophrenia liability. Subtle thought disorder in schizophrenia and its risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. Here, we propose to instead use a novel automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language. It also evaluates syntax through ""part-of-speech"" tagging. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture subtle thought disorder and discriminate psychosis outcome among CHR individuals. Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we were able to identify a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort at Columbia, which included semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, shortened phrase length, and decreased use of determiner pronouns (""which"", ""what"", ""that""). These features were correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in terms of classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. While promising, these automated methods of analysis require validation in a second CHR cohort. In this proposal, in collaboration with IBM, we will validate these automated methods using a large archive of speech data from the UCLA CHR cohort. This dataset has several advantages. First, the UCLA CHR cohort has a high prevalence of psychosis transition, important as machine learning is sensitive to group size. Second, it has undergone prior manual linguistic analysis, identifying features of language production that predicted psychosis outcome; hence, automated and manual methods can be directly compared. Third, there are speech data available from healthy controls and recent-onset psychosis patients (for validation). Fourth, several participants have multiple speech assays (such that stability of the classifier can be examined). Beyond validation of methods, we will maximize group size and combine speech data from Columbia and UCLA to characterize a common classifier of psychosis outcome. Automated methods for language analysis may improve prediction of psychosis onset and inform remediation strategies for its prevention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Subtle thought disorder is an early core feature of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset: it has traditionally been evaluated using clinical ratings or labor-intensive manual linguistic analyses. This proposal will apply novel computer-based speech analysis methods to existing datasets to identify abnormal semantic and syntactic features of language production that can predict or classify psychosis outcome among youths at clinical high risk for psychosis. Improved characterization of thought disorder can inform targeted preventive interventions for young people at risk for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, so as to reduce the morbidity of psychosis.            ",Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder.,9017082,R03MH108933,"['Address', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Friends', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'disabling symptom', 'effective intervention', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'standard of care', 'syntax', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R03,2016,81000,0.17230174764759432
"Using Machine Learning to Mitigate Reverberation Effects in Cochlear Implants ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cochlear implants (CIs) provide hearing for over 200,000 recipients worldwide {NIDCD, 2011 #637}. These devices successfully provide high levels of speech understanding in quiet listening conditions; however, more challenging conditions degrade speech comprehension for CI recipients to a much greater degree than for normal hearing listeners {Kokkinakis, 2011 #673;Nelson, 2003 #302}. CI listeners are especially affected by reverberant conditions with even a small level of reverberation degrading comprehension to a greater degree than a large amount of steady-state noise {Hazrati, 2012 #674}. Thus, a method that mitigates the effects of reverberation has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for CI users. Previous attempts to solve the problem of speech in reverberation for cochlear implants have not been able to be implemented in real time. Our preliminary results suggest that successful mitigation of overlap masking can result in a substantial improvement in speech recognition even if self-masking is not mitigated and we have devised an approach that can be implemented in real time. In the proposed effort, we will first improve the classifier to detect reverberation based on our successful preliminary efforts. Next we will assess the mitigation algorithm, first in normal hearing listeners and then in listeners with cochlear implants. Finally, we will implement the algorithm in real time and again test it. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While cochlear implants (CIs) provide high levels of speech comprehension in quiet for over 200,000 profoundly deaf individuals worldwide, speech in quiet scenarios are rarely encountered outside of the home. The presence of noise or reverberation in the listening environment decreases speech comprehension for CI users much more rapidly than for normal-hearing listeners, and of these two conditions, reverberation has a greater negative impact. The proposed research aims to provide a robust reverberation mitigation algorithm for CI speech processors thereby improving the ability of CI users to interact in real-world listening environments.",Using Machine Learning to Mitigate Reverberation Effects in Cochlear Implants,9100672,R01DC014290,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Categories', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Comprehension', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'improved', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'success']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,293885,0.2612885595838641
"Automated Speech Analysis: A Marker of Drug Intoxication & Treatment Outcome ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major limitation of existing assessments of clinically-relevant mental states related to drug use, abuse, and treatment is that self-report measures rely on the capacity and motivation to accurately report one's internal experiences. A potential alternative is presented by emerging computer-based natural language processing methods that can extract fine-grained semantic, structural, and syntactic features from free speech1, potentially providing a unique 'window into the mind.' These methods are widely used in industry2, yet remain largely unknown in clinical research. To begin to assess the potential of these advanced analytic methods in clinical research, we recently partnered with IBM computer science researchers to test computer-based analysis of speech semantic structure. In preliminary work, we were able to demonstrate that such methods could detect acute drug intoxication3 and accurately predicted the development of psychosis in clinical risk states4. Here, we propose to build on these highly promising initial findings, conducting three secondary data analyses to rapidly and cost-effectively advance this novel direction. Projects 1 and 2 will extend our preliminary work on speech markers of mental state changes during acute drug intoxication. In Project 1, we will assess speech semantic, structural, and syntactic features as markers of mental state changes due to MDMA (0, 0.75, 1.5 mg/kg; oral). In Project 2, we will extend these findings to another drug, assessing speech markers of intoxication with LSD (0, 70 Î¼g; intravenous). These projects are possible because we have access to existing transcripts of free speech from within-subject, controlled laboratory studies of the effects of MDMA (N = 77) and LSD (N = 19). Potential future uses for these methods could include rapid characterization of the effects of emerging drugs and, potentially, detection of acute drug intoxication in the absence of biochemical confirmation. Project 3 will assess the use of speech analysis as a prognostic marker in substance abuse treatment. Specifically, we will use speech transcripts (N = 50) from a currently ongoing study to assess whether features extracted from baseline free speech can predict treatment outcome in cocaine users undergoing 12 weeks of CBT relapse prevention. Self-report5,6 and manual coding of speech7-9 suggest that motivation to change may be a predictor of treatment outcome for substance use disorders: we expect that the fine-grained computational methods we will employ will allow the development of more accurate predictive models. The capacity to use automated methods to detect mental states from free speech has wide ranging, potentially transformative implications for addiction medicine and psychiatry more broadly4,10. Results of the proposed secondary analyses projects will efficiently advance understanding of how automated speech analysis, a non-invasive and cost- effective assessment method, could be used in clinical practice and research about drug abuse. More broadly, results may contribute to the empirical basis for the development of automated, objective, speech- based diagnostic and prognostic tests in psychiatry.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Free speech, a unique `window into the mind', represents a rich source of information that can be mined for clinically-relevant information. This application proposes to apply novel computer science speech analysis methods in three secondary data analysis projects to investigate 1) speech markers of mental states during acute drug intoxication; and 2) speech as a prognostic marker in cognitive behavioral treatment for drug abuse. Results will rapidly and cost-effectively advance understanding of how automated speech analysis could be used in clinical practice and research about drug use, abuse, and treatment.            ",Automated Speech Analysis: A Marker of Drug Intoxication & Treatment Outcome,9017684,R03DA040855,"['Acute', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Bypass', 'Cereals', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Abuse', 'Cocaine Users', 'Code', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intoxication', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Lysergic Acid Diethylamide', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mining', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Placebos', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cocaine use', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'ecstasy', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mental state', 'natural language', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic assays', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research in practice', 'substance abuse treatment', 'syntax']",NIDA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R03,2016,81000,0.23233926888549314
"Subthalamic and corticosubthalamic coding of speech production Speech production and control is disrupted in a number of neurological diseases that involve the basal ganglia. Notably, hypophonia and hypokinetic dysarthria (characterized by decreased motor gain) are prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) produces predictable improvements in other motor symptoms of PD but does not result in consistent improvement in speech and can negatively impact language function. These observations and other accumulating evidence indicate an important role for the basal ganglia in speech. However, a major impediment to developing treatments for speech deficits in movement disorders and reducing speech-related side effects of DBS is the absence of a neurophysiological model for basal ganglia participation in speech production. Testing how general tenets of basal ganglia organization and function apply to the speech motor system presents both unique challenges for clinical neuroscientists and significant opportunities to advance the cognitive neuroscience of speech production. Our overall goals are to determine how motor and linguistic speech information is encoded at multiple levels of granularity within the STN-cortical network, and to determine the relationship between neural activity within the STN-cortical network and the gain of vocal output. Despite the fact that electrophysiological data obtained during DBS surgery offers the unique opportunity to directly assess basal ganglia neuronal activity during speech, this paradigm remains remarkably unexplored. Our central hypothesis is that the STN contributes at multiple levels to the hierarchical control of speech production. Using a completely novel approach, we will rigorously test this hypothesis by simultaneously recording STN units, STN and cortical local field potentials (LFP), and spoken acoustics while PD subjects perform a speech task during DBS surgery. To test for encoding at different levels of granularity, we will explore the extent to which neuronal activity in the STN codes for articulatory and linguistic features associated with different levels of representation within the speech production system (Aim 1). To test for a role in voice modulation, we will explore the extent to which the STN codes for measures of gain, such as volume, pitch and fluency (Aim 2). Additionally, we will directly assess the causal role of STN function in speech production by delivering disruptive stimulation to the STN (Aim 3). A major strength of our project is the complimentary nature of extensive, multi-disciplinary expertise from team members at the University of Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins University and Carnegie Mellon University. This combined expertise allows us to employ a novel combination of classical analytic methods and more recent machine learning methods for supervised and exploratory analyses to document the neural dynamics of STN and cortical activity during speech production. Speech production and control is disrupted in a number of neurological diseases that involve the basal ganglia, for instance hypophonia and hypokinetic dysarthria are prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We will use a novel experimental approach and combination of analytic techniques to elucidate the contribution of neural activity in the subthalamic nucleus to the hierarchical control of speech production, in subjects with PD undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery.",Subthalamic and corticosubthalamic coding of speech production,9205890,U01NS098969,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dysarthria', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phonetics', 'Production', 'Role', 'STN stimulation', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'gain of function', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'microstimulation', 'motor symptom', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'response']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2016,900000,0.2991315128163392
"Speech Prosody and Articulatory Dynamics in Spoken Language DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One powerfully communicative aspect of language is prosody, which is the use of pitch, loudness, local rate modulation, and pauses in speech to signal its informational and affective content. Speech production deficits due to neurological damage such as stroke or due to Autism Spectrum Disorder are often characterized by prosodic irregularities. The long term objective of the proposed research program is to understand how linguistic structure and communicative context condition the spatiotemporal realization of articulatory movement during speaking. Our linguist-engineer team studies the ""signatures"" of prosody at the level of articulatory patterning. The specific aims of this proposal are to understand and model how speakers differentially modulate the spatiotemporal organization of articulatory gestures as a function of the cognitive source of a break in the speech stream and how the communicative context influences the temporal flow of the speech stream in articulation as speakers interact with one another. We outline a research strategy that investigates the relation between speech initiation/cessation and the control and coordination of articulation. Speech may start, pause, or cease for a variety of reasons in addition to linguistically structured phrase edges. Some breaks in the speech stream may be cognitively ""planned,"" such as interlocutor turn-taking in discourse. Other disruptions in the speech stream might be ""unplanned,"" such as interruptions and word finding challenges. Our approach investigates the articulation of speech in the vocal tract at turn-taking and interruptions in structured dialogue and in the vicinity of pauses that occur for cognitive speech planning reasons. We complement this experimental work with computational modeling of phrasal junctures and pauses, and with machine learning approaches to classifying breaks in speech arising from differing sources. The specific aims will be pursued by using articulatory movement data collected with magnetometer systems for tracking movement inside the mouth and by using our team's computational model of speech production. The experiment work and the concomitant computational modeling of the articulatory findings will provide a profile of the manner in which articulatory patterning is shapd by the larger informational structuring of utterances and by the demands of speech planning in a communicative context. One powerfully communicative aspect of language is prosody, which is the use of pitch, loudness, and temporal properties such as pauses in speech to signal its informational and affective content. Speech production deficits due to neurological damage such as stroke or due to Autism Spectrum Disorder are often characterized by prosodic irregularities and understanding the influence of structural prosody and its deployment in communication on the temporal flow of speech can have critical translational impact in that disfluencies are typically used as a basis for diagnosis of speech disorders. Our research uses instrumental tracking of articulatory movements during speech to provide an understanding of normative production of modulation and pauses in speech flow that could support evidence-driven assessments and treatments of prosodic breakdown in clinical populations, including deploying assistive technologies for the impaired such as automatic speech recognition and machine speech synthesis.",Speech Prosody and Articulatory Dynamics in Spoken Language,9036989,R01DC003172,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Articulators', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Gestures', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Interruption', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive load', 'constriction', 'dynamic system', 'kinematics', 'novel strategies', 'phrases', 'programs', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech disorder diagnosis', 'speech recognition', 'syntax']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,477237,0.3518412571504941
"SPEECH MOVEMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR ASSESSING AND TREATING ALS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is advance the assessment and treatment of speech motor impairments due to ALS using novel computer-based approaches. Recently developed speech movement tracking technology will be used to record movements of tongue, lips, and jaw in 50 persons with ALS and 50 healthy control participants. The speech movement data will be analyzed using custom machine learning algorithms to address three important translational needs in person with ALS: improved early detection of speech motor involvement, improved progress monitoring of speech motor decline, and improved options for maintaining oral communication. The established interdisciplinary team with expertise in data mining, speech- language pathology, clinical neurology, and spatial statistics are well positioned to conduct this research. If successful, the specific aims have the potential to transform clinical practice for speech-language pathologists, neurologists, and other related health care professionals. The propose research will enhance human health by making an impact on individuals with speech motor impairment due to ALS and potentially to a broad range of other speech motor due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, and orofacial or laryngeal cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ALS is one of the most common motor neuron diseases. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, approximately 30,000 Americans are living with ALS (NINDS, 2003). Recent evidence suggests ALS incidence is increasing in the general population (Strong & Rosenfeld, 2003), particularly among Gulf War veterans who are nearly twice as likely to develop the disease as veterans not deployed to the Gulf (Haley, 2003). This project is focused on the development and validation of novel machine-learning based tools for improving the assessment and treatment of patients with speech motor impairments due to ALS. If successful, this research may (1) improve early detection and prognostic accuracy, (2) and address the critical need for objective outcome measures for ongoing experimental drug trials, and (3) provide information to develop a novel oral communication device for persons with moderate to severe speech impairment. These developments may ameliorate the socioeconomic burden of speech motor impairments as well as the quality of life for these patients, their families, and the people they closely interact wit.",SPEECH MOVEMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR ASSESSING AND TREATING ALS,8985675,R01DC013547,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysarthria', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetics', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Language', 'Life', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Oral', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Synthesizers', 'Speech-Language Pathology', 'Staging', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Wit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'communication device', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'forging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'jaw movement', 'motor impairment', 'movement analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral communication', 'orofacial', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,R01,2016,585316,0.29564149814672025
"Functional Architecture of Speech Motor Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Speaking is one of the most complex actions that we perform, yet nearly all of us learn do it effortlessly. The ability to communicate through speech is often described as the unique and defining trait of human behavior. Despite its importance, the basic neural mechanisms that govern our ability to speak fluently remain unresolved. This proposal addresses two fundamental questions at the crossroads of linguistics, systems neuroscience, and biomedical engineering: 1) How are the kinematic and acoustic targets of articulation represented in human speech motor cortex?, 2) What are the coordinated patterns of cortical activation that gives rise to fluent, continuous speech?, and 3) How does prefrontal cortex govern the cognitive inhibitory control of speech (e.g. stopping)? Our studies should greatly advance understanding of how the speech motor cortex encodes the precise control of articulation during speech production as well as determine whether this control system can be harnessed for novel rehabilitative strategies. Three potential areas of impact are: Neurobiology of Language, where results will shed light on neurophysiologic mechanisms of speech motor control; Human Neurophysiology, where insight gained may suggest novel methods for machine learning-based analyses of distributed population neural activity; and Translational NeuroEngineering, where utilization of novel cortical recording technologies at unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution and duration. We propose to investigate the functional organization of the speech motor cortex during controlled vowel and syllable productions, but also from natural, continuous speech. Our methods utilizing safe, high-density, large-scale intracranial electrode recordings in humans represent a significant advancement over current noninvasive neuroimaging approaches. To accomplish this, we must innovate new, integrative approaches to speech motor control research. We have assembled a team with significant multi- disciplinary strengths in neurosurgery, neurology, ethics, computational modeling, machine learning, neuroscience, engineering, and linguistics. The most debilitating aspect of profound paralysis due to trauma, stroke, or disease is loss of the ability to speak, which leads to profound social isolation. Our research leverages foundational knowledge gained during research piloted under a NIH New Innovator (DP2) award.

"Dynamics of Vocal Tract Shaping ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to wed state-of-the-art technology for imaging the vocal tract with a linguistically informed analysis of dynamic vocal tract constriction actions in order to understand the control and production of the compositional units of spoken language. We have pioneered the use of real time MRI for speech imaging to illuminate articulatory dynamics and to understand how these emerge lawfully from the combined effects of vocal tract constriction events distributed over space (subparts of the tract) and over time. This project has developed and refined a novel real time MRI acquisition ability, making possible current reconstruction rates of up to 96 frames per second, quadrupling current imaging speeds. Data show clear real- time movements of the lips, tongue, velum and epiglottis, providing exquisite information about the spatiotemporal properties of speech gestures in both the oral and pharyngeal portions of the vocal tract. The project has also developed novel noise-mitigated image-synchronized strategies to record speech in-situ during imaging, as well as image processing strategies for deriving linguistically meaningful measures from the data, demon- strating the utility of this approach for linguistic studies of speech communication in a variety of languages. Using our direct access to dynamic information on vocal tract shaping, we investigate vocal tract shaping in three-dimensions as the composition of spatiotemporally coordinated vocal tract action units. This project's specific aims go beyond the dynamic shaping of individual vowels and consonants-postures over time-to examine more complex structuring of articulation-namely, the local and global influences governing linguistic control, temporal coherence and multi-unit coordination. The advances in our technical approach enable a series of studies that leverage: (i) unprecedented high-speech imaging with dynamic rtMRI to consider the prosodic modulation of temporally rapid and temporally coherent speech units; (ii) innovative multi-plane 3D imaging capability to inform the computational identification of linguistic control regimes; and (iii) a large- scale rtMRI corpus ad concomitant machine learning advances to move toward a principled account of system-level co-variability in space and time, both within and among individuals. This symbiotic theory-driven and data-driven research strategy will yield significant innovations in understanding spoken communication. It is no exaggeration to say that the advent of real-time MRI for speech has initiated a dramatic scientific change in the nature of speech production research by allowing for models of production driven by rich quantitative articulatory data. The project is having broad impact through the free dissemination of the unique rtMRI data corpora, tools and models-already used worldwide for research and teaching-and societal out- reach through its website and lay media coverage. Understanding articulatory compositional structure and cross-linguistic potentialities also has critical translational significance impacting the assessment and remediation of speech disorders, as our collaborative work on glossectomy and apraxia has begun to demonstrate.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time imaging of the moving vocal tract with MRI has made direct movies of speech production possible, allowing an investigation of the articulatory composition of speech in healthy adults and illuminating the articulatory dissolution and lack of coherence often found in spoken language disorders. This technology platform, coupled with a linguistically driven theoretical framework that understands speech as composed of articulatory units, provides a scientific foothold for evidence-driven assessment and remediation of speech breakdown in clinical populations, including articulatory remediation and training and deploying assistive technologies for the impaired (automatic speech recognition, machine speech synthesis), and has potential broad impact on the clinical needs of those with swallowing disorders, sleep apnea, or facing recovery of speech function after stroke or surgery. Further, because speech presents the only example of rapid, cognitively- controlled, internal movements of the body, the unique challenges of speech production imaging offer the wider biomedical imaging community traction for advances that improve temporal and spatial image resolution-advances with potential import for cardiac and other imaging.            ",Dynamics of Vocal Tract Shaping,9030116,R01DC007124,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Apraxias', 'Articulators', 'Beds', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Epiglottis structure', 'Event', 'German population', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Larynx', 'Lateral', 'Linguistics', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Pattern', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'computerized tools', 'constriction', 'dexterity', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'internal control', 'movie', 'novel', 'outreach', 'phonology', 'program dissemination', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'remediation', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech recognition', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'tongue apex', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,433810,0.3044822393919663
"The Cortical Dynamics of Motor Activity During Speech Production Speech is critical for human communication, but the cortical control of the fundamental movements of speech production is not clearly understood. Current knowledge primarily stems from functional imaging and lesion studies, which lack the ability to observe rapid changes in activity. Advances in electrocorticography (ECoG) now enable investigation of rapid changes over multiple cortical regions. Early ECoG studies have found ventral motor cortex (M1) activity broadly related to large vocal pitch change and loosely correlated with production of speech sounds, or phonemes. I have demonstrated that even single instances of phonemes can be identified during word production from patterns in activity in M1. However, motor control studies show M1 activity primarily represents movements. Correspondingly, the movements of speech, such as those of the laryngeal musculature involved in vocal pitch, are well understood. Similarly, phonology literature suggests the basic units of speech production are simple articulator movements, or gestures, such as tongue tip closure. Despite strong evidence for movement representation in M1, speech movements have yet to be been investigated with ECoG. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate how the motor cortices control speech movements of articulators and vocal pitch. The research aims of this proposal are to determine the cortical representation of articulatory gestures and vocal pitch during speech and non-speech movements. I will decode high-gamma activity (70-200 Hz) of M1, premotor cortex (PM) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) to estimate representation of these movements. Decoding accuracy will quantify the extent to which gestures are represented in each cortical area during speech and non-speech movements. Preliminary results reveal distinct cortical signatures in M1 related to gesture production. Completion of these goals will result in a model of cortical representation of speech movements. This work will enable substantiation of neurophysiological theories, lead to practical applications for patients, and enable investigations of motor activity during higher- order processes of speech. Moreover, we enable comparison of speech to other motor control processes. Results will improve understanding of the cortical representation of the larynx, which remains poorly understood in human physiology research. This study examines cortical activity of motor areas during speech production, with the goal of identifying the cortical representation of articulatory movements and vocal pitch. This research will address fundamental questions about speech motor control during production and phonation, which will enable evaluation of neurophysiological theories and lead to practical applications for patients.",The Cortical Dynamics of Motor Activity During Speech Production,9191603,F32DC015708,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articulators', 'Communication', 'Controlled Study', 'Craniotomy', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lip structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phonation', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'awake', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'neurosurgery', 'patient population', 'phonology', 'phrases', 'practical application', 'relating to nervous system', 'restoration', 'speech processing', 'stem', 'theories', 'tongue apex', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F32,2016,53358,0.26144782156408775
"Real-Time Articulation-to-Speech Mapping for Enhancing Impaired Oral Communication ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of a silent speech interface (SSI) as an alternative mode of oral communication for persons who are unable to use their voice (e.g., after laryngectomy, surgical removal of larynx due to the treatment of cancer). We have recently developed a real-time, interactive SSI based on a commercial electromagnetic articulograph. The SSI converts tongue and lip movement to text, and then plays back corresponding synthesized speech sounds with natural sounding voice in real-time. The SSI has potential to restore the patient's voice by identifying the patient's voice characteristics before laryngectomy. Preliminary tests on healthy participants demonstrated the feasibility of the SSI. In this project, we further evaluate the system by studying 15 participants after laryngectomy and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. If successful, the SSI has the potential to transform clinical practice for speech-language pathologists other related health care professionals. The proposed research will enhance human health by making an impact on individuals after laryngectomy and potentially to a broad range of other speech and voice disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Silent speech interfaces (SSIs) are a novel alternative mode of oral communication for persons who are unable to produce speech sounds (e.g., individuals who undergo a laryngectomy, removal of larynx due to the treatment of laryngeal cancer). SSIs recognize speech sounds from articulatory data and then drive text-to-speech synthesis, which produces speech with natural sounding voice, which is one of the advantages over the current treatment options for these individuals. SSIs hold potential to even restore the patient's own voice by identifying the patient's voice characteristics before laryngectomy. Although participants after laryngectomy will be the test case in this project, the clinical implications of SSIs extend to a larger population of persons with other speech and voice disorders.",Real-Time Articulation-to-Speech Mapping for Enhancing Impaired Oral Communication,9114061,R03DC013990,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetics', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Laryngeal Prosthesis', 'Laryngectomy', 'Larynx', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Research', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Tracheoesophageal Speech', 'United States', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'kinematics', 'movement analysis', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'sound']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R03,2016,153000,0.30320896376225925
"Neurophysiology of robust speech perception in human superior temporal gyrus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Perceiving and following an individual speaker in a crowded, noisy environment is a commonplace task for listeners with normal hearing. The underlying neurophysiology, however, is complex, and the task remains a struggle for people with peripheral and central auditory pathway disorders. The lack of a detailed neurobiological model of mechanisms and functions underlying robust speech perception has hindered our understanding of how these processes become impaired in the suffering population. In our innovative approach, we will record from high-density micro and macro electrode arrays surgically implanted on the superior temporal gyrus of epilepsy patients as part of their clinical evaluation. This method offers an exceptionally detailed perspective of cortical population activity. We will build upon two recent complementary findings where we identified a highly selective, spatially distributed neural representation of phonetic features (Mesgarani et. al. Science, 2014), which at the same time is highly dynamic and can change rapidly to reflect the perceptual bias of the listener (Mesgarani & Chang, Nature 2012). While significant, these studies revealed several gaps in our understanding of this process, which we intend to address in this proposal. Specifically, we will resolve the following unanswered questions: 1) what is the neural mechanism for joint encoding of both phonetic and speaker features? 2) How does attention modulate phonetic and speaker feature selectivity of neural responses? And 3) what computational mechanisms can account for dynamic feature selectivity of responses in STG? Answering these questions will significantly advance our understanding of a remarkable human ability, and will be of great interest to researchers from many areas including neurologists, and sensory and cognitive neuroscientists. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the mechanisms underlying speech perception in challenging environments is a crucial step in determining how these processes deteriorate in various disorders of peripheral and central auditory pathways.

"Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research Abstract: Researchers rely upon the lesion method to evaluate the speech-language status of stroke survivors and draw inferences about underlying brain function. This use of neuropsychology is highly valued in basic speech- language research because it can support causal inferences about brain structure/function relationships. Crucially, advances in analytic techniques and brain image computing are creating a new landscape for neuropsychological research. In this new landscape, the lesion method represents a form of big-data science that requires large sample sizes and complex image computing to implement lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) across the entire brain, without prior regions of interest. Expertise in these new techniques is becoming critical for high impact speech-language research. The career enhancement plan will provide the candidate with training in cutting-edge LSM. The candidate is an established speech-language investigator with a basic program of multidisciplinary research that includes populations with communication disorders due to stroke. The career enhancement will come at an ideal point, because it will build on the candidate's success in establishing an open-access research registry of stroke survivors (the Western Pennsylvania Patient Registry, WPPR), and current work to develop and validate collaborative videoconferencing for remote neuropsychological assessment. These efforts have created the recruitment pool and datasets that are needed for LSM. The career enhancement will provide the training needed to leverage these resources, thereby augmenting the candidate's program of research and career trajectory. The overarching objectives are to: (1) retool the skills of the candidate to infuse LSM into her program of speech-language research, (2) seed data sharing and data science partnerships to boost the candidate's leadership of WPPR as a national resource, and (3) advance understanding of LSM methods and the neural substrates for speech and language to improve the knowledge base of the candidate and other investigators. The candidate proposes a synergistic set of activities. Didactic activities will give training in machie learning and brain image computing, scholarly travel experiences will afford opportunities to network with speech-language researchers and data scientists whose work is relevant for LSM, and two research studies will provide a hands-on opportunity for the candidate to acquire, apply, and extend LSM methods under the guidance of a superb mentoring team. Study 1 will use univariate and multivariate LSM analysis to investigate the neural substrates of chronic Broca's aphasia and the factors that influence the reproducibility of LSM results. Study 2 will develop and evaluate a workflow for automated lesion segmentation, using a software platform (3D Slicer) that involves two NIH-supported data science centers. Overall, the career enhancement will retool the skills, research network, and knowledge base of an established investigator, allowing the candidate to significantly augment her program of speech-language research and advance the utility of WPPR as a national resource for speech-language research.

"NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF OPTIMAL MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Speech perception is one of the most important cognitive operations performed by the human brain and is fundamentally multisensory: when conversing with someone, we use both visual information from their face and auditory information from their voice. Multisensory speech perception is especially important when the auditory component of the speech is noisy, either due to a hearing disorder or normal aging. However, much less is known about the neural computations underlying visual speech perception than about those underlying auditory speech perception. To remedy this gap in existing knowledge, we will use converging evidence from two complementary measures of brain activity, BOLD fMRI and electrocorticography (ECoG). The results of these neural recording studies will be interpreted in the context of a flexible computational model based on the emerging tenet that the brain performs multisensory integration using optimal or Bayesian inference, combining the currently available sensory information with prior experience.  In the first Aim, a Bayesian model will be constructed to explain individual differences in multisensory speech perception along three axes: subjects' ability to understand noisy audiovisual speech; subjects' susceptibility to the McGurk effect, a multisensory illusion; and the time spent fixating the mouth of a talking face.  In the second Aim, we will explore the neural encoding of visual speech using voxel-wise forward encoding models of the BOLD fMRI signal. We will develop encoding models to test 7 different theories of visual speech representation from the linguistic and computer vision literature. In the third Aim, we will use ECoG to examine the neural computations for integrating visual and auditory speech, guided by the Bayesian models developed in Aim 1. First, we will study reduced neural variability for multisensory speech predicted by our model. Second, we will study the representational space of unisensory and multisensory speech.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding speech is one of the most important functions of the human brain. We use information from both the auditory modality (the voice of the person we are talking to) and the visual modality (the facial movements of the person we are talking to) to understand speech. We will use computational models, eye tracking, and brain imaging and recording techniques to study the organization and operation of the brain during audiovisual speech perception.            ",NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF OPTIMAL MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION,9055439,R01NS065395,"['Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Employee Strikes', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oral cavity', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'audiovisual speech', 'base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'multisensory', 'normal aging', 'operation', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'speech accuracy', 'theories', 'visual information', 'visual speech']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,346719,0.2855438796579336
"Investigating neural mechanisms for flexible, robust speech perception with fMRI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain is bombarded by sensory information from the world, and must extract certain pieces of useful information using limited neural resources. This means that the brain must be efficient, throwing away information that is not needed in order to focus on the most important part of the sensory information from the world. However, information that is uninformative in one situation may be highly informative in another, and thus this efficiency must be matched by flexibility. One domain where this is particularly true is speech perception, where a noisy, ambiguous sensory signal is mapped onto underlying linguistic units like phonemes, words, and sentences. This mapping changes substantially depending on who is talking. One way the brain might deal with this is to learn talker-specific representations which optimize the efficiency with which speech sounds are processed, and deploy or ""swap out"" those representations whenever the talker changes, learning new representations for new talkers as necessary. While there is some evidence that listeners do use such a strategy, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. This proposal seeks to clarify these mechanisms through two specific aims. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will image the brains of listeners while they are hearing words from two talkers with different accents, mixed together. By comparing the areas that are active when the talker switches with areas that are active during periods of learning about each accent (as measured by behavioral responses), the circuits by which listeners learn and deploy talker-specific representations will be elucidated. Second, using multi-voxel pattern analysis techniques, the neural representations of identical speech sounds which have different interpretations depending on the talker will be measured to determine how deeply talker-specific knowledge affects the processing of speech sounds. If talker-specific knowledge is being used to optimize the efficiency of perceptual processing at a low level, then within-category differences should result in more similar patterns of activity, while across-category differences should result in more distinct patterns of activity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to flexibly adjust the processing and representation of speech sounds depending on who is talking is absolutely fundamental to the effective and fluent comprehension of spoken language, and impairments in this ability would make daily life very difficult. Completion of the proposed research has the potential to lead to new views on neurological disorders which impact language, like Williams Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment, and possibly new classifications of these disorders. Furthermore, by linking robust speech comprehension to more general perceptual adaptation and learning, the proposed work has the potential to shed light on the underlying pathology of disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, which have been hypothesized to involve deficiencies in the integration of top-down expectations and bottom-up sensory information, both in language processing (Stewart & Ota, 2008; Yu, 2010) and general perception (Pellicano & Burr, 2012).                ","Investigating neural mechanisms for flexible, robust speech perception with fMRI",8992857,F31HD082893,"['Accent', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breeding', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peach', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Voice', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'disease classification', 'expectation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'statistics', 'transmission process']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,F31,2016,20746,0.13673460671751222
"Using Machine Learning to Mitigate Reverberation Effects in Cochlear Implants ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cochlear implants (CIs) provide hearing for over 200,000 recipients worldwide {NIDCD, 2011 #637}. These devices successfully provide high levels of speech understanding in quiet listening conditions; however, more challenging conditions degrade speech comprehension for CI recipients to a much greater degree than for normal hearing listeners {Kokkinakis, 2011 #673;Nelson, 2003 #302}. CI listeners are especially affected by reverberant conditions with even a small level of reverberation degrading comprehension to a greater degree than a large amount of steady-state noise {Hazrati, 2012 #674}. Thus, a method that mitigates the effects of reverberation has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for CI users. Previous attempts to solve the problem of speech in reverberation for cochlear implants have not been able to be implemented in real time. Our preliminary results suggest that successful mitigation of overlap masking can result in a substantial improvement in speech recognition even if self-masking is not mitigated and we have devised an approach that can be implemented in real time. In the proposed effort, we will first improve the classifier to detect reverberation based on our successful preliminary efforts. Next we will assess the mitigation algorithm, first in normal hearing listeners and then in listeners with cochlear implants. Finally, we will implement the algorithm in real time and again test it.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While cochlear implants (CIs) provide high levels of speech comprehension in quiet for over 200,000 profoundly deaf individuals worldwide, speech in quiet scenarios are rarely encountered outside of the home. The presence of noise or reverberation in the listening environment decreases speech comprehension for CI users much more rapidly than for normal-hearing listeners, and of these two conditions, reverberation has a greater negative impact. The proposed research aims to provide a robust reverberation mitigation algorithm for CI speech processors thereby improving the ability of CI users to interact in real-world listening environments.            ",Using Machine Learning to Mitigate Reverberation Effects in Cochlear Implants,8963088,R01DC014290,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Categories', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Comprehension', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Frequencies', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'success']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,289263,0.2612885595838641
"Speech Prosody and Articulatory Dynamics in Spoken Language DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One powerfully communicative aspect of language is prosody, which is the use of pitch, loudness, local rate modulation, and pauses in speech to signal its informational and affective content. Speech production deficits due to neurological damage such as stroke or due to Autism Spectrum Disorder are often characterized by prosodic irregularities. The long term objective of the proposed research program is to understand how linguistic structure and communicative context condition the spatiotemporal realization of articulatory movement during speaking. Our linguist-engineer team studies the ""signatures"" of prosody at the level of articulatory patterning. The specific aims of this proposal are to understand and model how speakers differentially modulate the spatiotemporal organization of articulatory gestures as a function of the cognitive source of a break in the speech stream and how the communicative context influences the temporal flow of the speech stream in articulation as speakers interact with one another. We outline a research strategy that investigates the relation between speech initiation/cessation and the control and coordination of articulation. Speech may start, pause, or cease for a variety of reasons in addition to linguistically structured phrase edges. Some breaks in the speech stream may be cognitively ""planned,"" such as interlocutor turn-taking in discourse. Other disruptions in the speech stream might be ""unplanned,"" such as interruptions and word finding challenges. Our approach investigates the articulation of speech in the vocal tract at turn-taking and interruptions in structured dialogue and in the vicinity of pauses that occur for cognitive speech planning reasons. We complement this experimental work with computational modeling of phrasal junctures and pauses, and with machine learning approaches to classifying breaks in speech arising from differing sources. The specific aims will be pursued by using articulatory movement data collected with magnetometer systems for tracking movement inside the mouth and by using our team's computational model of speech production. The experiment work and the concomitant computational modeling of the articulatory findings will provide a profile of the manner in which articulatory patterning is shapd by the larger informational structuring of utterances and by the demands of speech planning in a communicative context. One powerfully communicative aspect of language is prosody, which is the use of pitch, loudness, and temporal properties such as pauses in speech to signal its informational and affective content. Speech production deficits due to neurological damage such as stroke or due to Autism Spectrum Disorder are often characterized by prosodic irregularities and understanding the influence of structural prosody and its deployment in communication on the temporal flow of speech can have critical translational impact in that disfluencies are typically used as a basis for diagnosis of speech disorders. Our research uses instrumental tracking of articulatory movements during speech to provide an understanding of normative production of modulation and pauses in speech flow that could support evidence-driven assessments and treatments of prosodic breakdown in clinical populations, including deploying assistive technologies for the impaired such as automatic speech recognition and machine speech synthesis.",Speech Prosody and Articulatory Dynamics in Spoken Language,8828663,R01DC003172,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Articulators', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Gestures', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Interruption', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive load', 'constriction', 'kinematics', 'novel strategies', 'phrases', 'programs', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech disorder diagnosis', 'speech recognition', 'syntax']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,472112,0.3518412571504941
"SPEECH MOVEMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR ASSESSING AND TREATING ALS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is advance the assessment and treatment of speech motor impairments due to ALS using novel computer-based approaches. Recently developed speech movement tracking technology will be used to record movements of tongue, lips, and jaw in 50 persons with ALS and 50 healthy control participants. The speech movement data will be analyzed using custom machine learning algorithms to address three important translational needs in person with ALS: improved early detection of speech motor involvement, improved progress monitoring of speech motor decline, and improved options for maintaining oral communication. The established interdisciplinary team with expertise in data mining, speech- language pathology, clinical neurology, and spatial statistics are well positioned to conduct this research. If successful, the specific aims have the potential to transform clinical practice for speech-language pathologists, neurologists, and other related health care professionals. The propose research will enhance human health by making an impact on individuals with speech motor impairment due to ALS and potentially to a broad range of other speech motor due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, and orofacial or laryngeal cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ALS is one of the most common motor neuron diseases. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, approximately 30,000 Americans are living with ALS (NINDS, 2003). Recent evidence suggests ALS incidence is increasing in the general population (Strong & Rosenfeld, 2003), particularly among Gulf War veterans who are nearly twice as likely to develop the disease as veterans not deployed to the Gulf (Haley, 2003). This project is focused on the development and validation of novel machine-learning based tools for improving the assessment and treatment of patients with speech motor impairments due to ALS. If successful, this research may (1) improve early detection and prognostic accuracy, (2) and address the critical need for objective outcome measures for ongoing experimental drug trials, and (3) provide information to develop a novel oral communication device for persons with moderate to severe speech impairment. These developments may ameliorate the socioeconomic burden of speech motor impairments as well as the quality of life for these patients, their families, and the people they closely interact wit.",SPEECH MOVEMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR ASSESSING AND TREATING ALS,8775639,R01DC013547,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysarthria', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetics', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Language', 'Life', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Oral', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Synthesizers', 'Speech-Language Pathology', 'Staging', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Wit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'forging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'jaw movement', 'motor impairment', 'movement analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral communication', 'orofacial', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,R01,2015,584132,0.29564149814672025
"Real-Time Articulation-to-Speech Mapping for Enhancing Impaired Oral Communication ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of a silent speech interface (SSI) as an alternative mode of oral communication for persons who are unable to use their voice (e.g., after laryngectomy, surgical removal of larynx due to the treatment of cancer). We have recently developed a real-time, interactive SSI based on a commercial electromagnetic articulograph. The SSI converts tongue and lip movement to text, and then plays back corresponding synthesized speech sounds with natural sounding voice in real-time. The SSI has potential to restore the patient's voice by identifying the patient's voice characteristics before laryngectomy. Preliminary tests on healthy participants demonstrated the feasibility of the SSI. In this project, we further evaluate the system by studying 15 participants after laryngectomy and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. If successful, the SSI has the potential to transform clinical practice for speech-language pathologists other related health care professionals. The proposed research will enhance human health by making an impact on individuals after laryngectomy and potentially to a broad range of other speech and voice disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Silent speech interfaces (SSIs) are a novel alternative mode of oral communication for persons who are unable to produce speech sounds (e.g., individuals who undergo a laryngectomy, removal of larynx due to the treatment of laryngeal cancer). SSIs recognize speech sounds from articulatory data and then drive text-to-speech synthesis, which produces speech with natural sounding voice, which is one of the advantages over the current treatment options for these individuals. SSIs hold potential to even restore the patient's own voice by identifying the patient's voice characteristics before laryngectomy. Although participants after laryngectomy will be the test case in this project, the clinical implications of SSIs extend to a larger population of persons with other speech and voice disorders.                ",Real-Time Articulation-to-Speech Mapping for Enhancing Impaired Oral Communication,8957652,R03DC013990,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetics', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Laryngeal Prosthesis', 'Laryngectomy', 'Larynx', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Research', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Tracheoesophageal Speech', 'United States', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'kinematics', 'movement analysis', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'public health relevance', 'sound']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R03,2015,153000,0.30320896376225925
"Neurophysiology of robust speech perception in human superior temporal gyrus     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Perceiving and following an individual speaker in a crowded, noisy environment is a commonplace task for listeners with normal hearing. The underlying neurophysiology, however, is complex, and the task remains a struggle for people with peripheral and central auditory pathway disorders. The lack of a detailed neurobiological model of mechanisms and functions underlying robust speech perception has hindered our understanding of how these processes become impaired in the suffering population. In our innovative approach, we will record from high-density micro and macro electrode arrays surgically implanted on the superior temporal gyrus of epilepsy patients as part of their clinical evaluation. This method offers an exceptionally detailed perspective of cortical population activity. We will build upon two recent complementary findings where we identified a highly selective, spatially distributed neural representation of phonetic features (Mesgarani et. al. Science, 2014), which at the same time is highly dynamic and can change rapidly to reflect the perceptual bias of the listener (Mesgarani & Chang, Nature 2012). While significant, these studies revealed several gaps in our understanding of this process, which we intend to address in this proposal. Specifically, we will resolve the following unanswered questions: 1) what is the neural mechanism for joint encoding of both phonetic and speaker features? 2) How does attention modulate phonetic and speaker feature selectivity of neural responses? And 3) what computational mechanisms can account for dynamic feature selectivity of responses in STG? Answering these questions will significantly advance our understanding of a remarkable human ability, and will be of great interest to researchers from many areas including neurologists, and sensory and cognitive neuroscientists.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the mechanisms underlying speech perception in challenging environments is a crucial step in determining how these processes deteriorate in various disorders of peripheral and central auditory pathways. Our studies will result in novel neurobiological models of robust speech perception that will serve as a necessary step toward designing innovative therapeutic measures.                ",Neurophysiology of robust speech perception in human superior temporal gyrus,8801902,R01DC014279,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Cues', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phonetics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathology', 'Speech Perception', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Voice', 'Work', 'attentional modulation', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive ability', 'computer framework', 'density', 'design', 'expectation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'selective attention', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2015,408878,0.12471153486932793
"Investigating neural mechanisms for flexible, robust speech perception with fMRI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain is bombarded by sensory information from the world, and must extract certain pieces of useful information using limited neural resources. This means that the brain must be efficient, throwing away information that is not needed in order to focus on the most important part of the sensory information from the world. However, information that is uninformative in one situation may be highly informative in another, and thus this efficiency must be matched by flexibility. One domain where this is particularly true is speech perception, where a noisy, ambiguous sensory signal is mapped onto underlying linguistic units like phonemes, words, and sentences. This mapping changes substantially depending on who is talking. One way the brain might deal with this is to learn talker-specific representations which optimize the efficiency with which speech sounds are processed, and deploy or ""swap out"" those representations whenever the talker changes, learning new representations for new talkers as necessary. While there is some evidence that listeners do use such a strategy, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. This proposal seeks to clarify these mechanisms through two specific aims. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will image the brains of listeners while they are hearing words from two talkers with different accents, mixed together. By comparing the areas that are active when the talker switches with areas that are active during periods of learning about each accent (as measured by behavioral responses), the circuits by which listeners learn and deploy talker-specific representations will be elucidated. Second, using multi-voxel pattern analysis techniques, the neural representations of identical speech sounds which have different interpretations depending on the talker will be measured to determine how deeply talker-specific knowledge affects the processing of speech sounds. If talker-specific knowledge is being used to optimize the efficiency of perceptual processing at a low level, then within-category differences should result in more similar patterns of activity, while across-category differences should result in more distinct patterns of activity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to flexibly adjust the processing and representation of speech sounds depending on who is talking is absolutely fundamental to the effective and fluent comprehension of spoken language, and impairments in this ability would make daily life very difficult. Completion of the proposed research has the potential to lead to new views on neurological disorders which impact language, like Williams Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment, and possibly new classifications of these disorders. Furthermore, by linking robust speech comprehension to more general perceptual adaptation and learning, the proposed work has the potential to shed light on the underlying pathology of disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, which have been hypothesized to involve deficiencies in the integration of top-down expectations and bottom-up sensory information, both in language processing (Stewart & Ota, 2008; Yu, 2010) and general perception (Pellicano & Burr, 2012).                ","Investigating neural mechanisms for flexible, robust speech perception with fMRI",8831930,F31HD082893,"['Accent', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breeding', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peach', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Voice', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'disease classification', 'expectation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'language processing', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'statistics', 'transmission process']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,F31,2015,28238,0.13673460671751222
"Multimodal Speech Translation for Assistive Communication DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysarthria, a neuromotor speech disorder impacting over 4 million Americans, is often so severe that speech is rendered unintelligible, requiring the use of augmentative and/or alternative communication (AAC) devices. These devices are dated, cumbersome and bulky. Rather than engaging in face-to-face interaction, AAC users spend a disproportionate amount of time navigating through menus of letters/icons to compose a message, which can then be spoken aloud by an integrated text-to-speech synthesis system. Thus AAC interactions are slow, effortful, unnatural, and often hinder rather than support social, educational and vocational opportunities. In fact, many AAC users continue to vocalize with familiar caregivers implying that consistent patterns must underlie dysarthric productions. It is these imprecise yet consistent productions that we propose to capture via multimodal sensors and classify using pattern recognition algorithms for speech translation. While automatic speech recognition is a viable technology for neurologically intact speakers or those with mild impairments, it fails in acoustically harsh speaking contexts and for those with more severe dysarthria. Instead, we focus on multimodal (lingual kinematic and acoustic; LinKA) representations of speech as they provide redundant and complementary channels of input for improved disambiguation. While other approaches have used computer vision, ultrasound imaging and electromyography to simultaneously estimate articulatory and acoustic parameters of speech, they are limited in portability, cost, and application to clinical settings. The current proposal leverages a novel, lightweight, wearable and low-cost array of magnetic sensors near the cheeks that can recognize the magnetic field patterns generated by a small magnetic tracer placed on the tongue to capture lingual kinematics during speech. Coupling tongue movements with the acoustic signal, captured via microphones mounted on the same headset, provides a multidimensional representation of speech that can then be translated into clear understandable speech for a new generation of wearable, speech-driven AAC devices. The proposed work will optimize the efficiency and robustness of lingual-kinematic and acoustic sensing for mobile speech translation (Aim 1), yield a standardized implementation protocol for training and independent use of the LinKA system (Aim 2), and culminate in a 2-week field test of the LinKA translator with 12 potential users with speech impairment (Aim 3). The current proposal is a first and essential step toward a low-cost, wearable, personalized communication enhancement system that can broaden communication opportunities and networks for individuals with speech impairment and thereby increase communication participation, independence and overall quality of life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuromotor speech disorders limit communication opportunities and access to social, educational and employment activities for nearly 4 million Americans. The LinKA (Lingual Kinematic and Acoustic) system is the first low-cost, wireless and wearable technology to simultaneously capture tongue movements and corresponding acoustics of speech. Coupling multimodal speech detection with sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms and an intelligent user interface, we propose to develop the LinKA Translator - an enabling technology that would disambiguate disordered productions and translate them into clear, understandable speech to broaden communication networks for individuals with speech disorder and thereby increase quality of life and independence.",Multimodal Speech Translation for Assistive Communication,8913172,R21EB018764,"['Acoustics', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication device', 'Caregivers', 'Cheek structure', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Interface', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dysarthria', 'Electromyography', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Generations', 'Hawks', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Magnetism', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Running', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Disorders', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Wheelchairs', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'alternative communication', 'coping', 'cost', 'design', 'deviant', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'kinematics', 'magnetic field', 'novel', 'phrases', 'portability', 'research study', 'sensor', 'social', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,108940,0.32136761715055334
"Longitudinal Voice Patterns in Bipolar Disorder DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research study will identify changes in acoustic speech parameters, using innovative cell phone based technology, in order to predict clinically significant mood state transitions in individuals with bipolar disorder. The central hypothesis is that there are quantitative changes in acoustic speech patterns that occur in advance of clinically observed mood changes. These changes is speech patterns can be identified using computational methods over longitudinal monitoring of ecologically gathered voice data that requires minimal input from the individual being observed. These computationally determined changes are imperceptible to human observation but are hypothesized to predict clinically significant mood transitions. To test this hypothesis we will study 50 rapid cycling individuals with bipolar I and II disorder and 10 healthy controls for 6 months by recording their acoustic characteristics of speech (not lexical content) while using a mobile ""smart- phone"". In this manner we are gathering data free of observer bias. We will also gather weekly clinical assessments with standardized instruments (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale) in which we will record their physical voice patterns as well. Bipolar disorder is an ideal disorder for the initial study of speech patterns in the assessment of psychopathology. It is an illness with pathological disruptions of emotion, cognitive and motor capacity. There is a periodicity of the illness pattern that oscillates between manic energized states with charged emotions and pressured rapid speech to depressed emotional phases with retarded movements and inhibited quality and quantity of speech. The successful management of patients with bipolar disorder requires ongoing clinical monitoring of mental states. Currently there are few technologies that address the challenge of monitoring individuals long-term in an ecological manner. Speech pattern recognition technology would allow for unobtrusive monitoring that can be seamlessly integrated into daily routine of mobile phone usage to predict future changes in illness states. The proposed study tests a highly innovative approach by developing a practical solution to assist in the longitudinal management of bipolar patients. Computational algorithms of analyzed speech patterns will use statistic (Gausian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling. This project has the potential of transformative advances in the management of psychiatric disease, as speech patterns, and changes therein, are highly likely to be reflective of current and emerging psychopathology. If successful this technology will provide for the prioritization of patients for medical and psychiatric care based on computational detection of change patterns in voice and speech before they are clinically observable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study that detects measurable changes in speech patterns using computer-based analyses and correlates these changes with pathological variation in clinically assessed mood states. Changes in speech patterns are likely to precede and predict clinically significant mood state changes (to mania or depression). The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of mood changes that will provide the opportunity for early clinical intervention.",Longitudinal Voice Patterns in Bipolar Disorder,8843048,R34MH100404,"['Accent', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Bipolar II', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observer Variation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Periodicity', 'Personality', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Secure', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar mania', 'bipolar patients', 'clinically significant', 'digital', 'heuristics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'lexical', 'markov model', 'mental state', 'pressure', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'research study', 'speech processing', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R34,2015,155500,0.22586013548923137
"Video-based Speech Enhancement for Vision and Hearing Impairment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Video-based Speech Enhancement for Persons with Hearing and Vision Loss Project Summary It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people in the United States over the age of 65 will account for over 20% of the total population.  Hearing and vision loss naturally accompanies the aging process.  Persons with hearing loss can benefit from observing the visual cues from a speaker such as the shape of the lips and facial expression to greatly improve their ability to comprehend speech.  However, persons with vision loss cannot make use of these visual cues, and have a harder time understanding speech, especially in noisy environments.  Furthermore, people with normal vision can use visual information to identify a speaker in a group, which allows them to focus on this person.  This can greatly benefit a person with hearing loss who may be using a device such as a sound amplifier or a hearing aid.  A user with vision loss, however, needs to be provided with this speaker information to make optimal use of such devices.  We propose developing a prototype device that will clean the speech signal from a target speaker and improve speech comprehension for persons with hearing and vision loss in everyday situations.  In order to accomplish this task, we need to harness the visual cues that have so far largely been ignored in the design of assistive technolo- gies for persons with hearing loss.  Our first aim is to learn speaker-independent visual cues that are associated with the target speech signal, and use these audio-visual cues to design speech enhancement algorithms that perform much better in noisy everyday environment than current methods which only utilize the audio signal.  We will utilize a video camera and computer vision methods to design advanced digital signal processing techniques to enhance the target speech signals recorded through a microphone.  Our second aim is to use the video and audio signals to detect and efficiently localize the visible speaker.  The information regarding the location of the speaker of interest can then be used to efficiently perform speaker separation, as well as be provided to the user.  Finally, we aim to implement these developed algorithms on a portable prototype system.  We will test the performance of this system and improve the user-interface through user experiments in real-world situations as well as laboratory conditions.  The end product will show the feasibility and importance of incorporating multiple modalities into sensory assistive devices, and set the stage for future research and development efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It is estimated that by 2030, more than one in five people in the United States will be over the age of 65.  Age- related hearing and vision loss is considered a natural consequence of the aging process, yet current assistive technology approaches do little to address this type of sensory loss.  The proposed research will test the feasibility of incorporating visual information in hearing aids, which is expected to improve speech perception for persons with hearing and vision loss in everyday situations, greatly enhancing their ability to lead independent lives, remain employable, and maintain active participation in society.                ",Video-based Speech Enhancement for Vision and Hearing Impairment,8659442,R21EY022200,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lip structure', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Aids', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Voice', 'base', 'design', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'social', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'tool development', 'visual information']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2014,230945,0.0903499156000311
"Speech Prosody and Articulatory Dynamics in Spoken Language     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One powerfully communicative aspect of language is prosody, which is the use of pitch, loudness, local rate modulation, and pauses in speech to signal its informational and affective content. Speech production deficits due to neurological damage such as stroke or due to Autism Spectrum Disorder are often characterized by prosodic irregularities. The long term objective of the proposed research program is to understand how linguistic structure and communicative context condition the spatiotemporal realization of articulatory movement during speaking. Our linguist-engineer team studies the ""signatures"" of prosody at the level of articulatory patterning. The specific aims of this proposal are to understand and model how speakers differentially modulate the spatiotemporal organization of articulatory gestures as a function of the cognitive source of a break in the speech stream and how the communicative context influences the temporal flow of the speech stream in articulation as speakers interact with one another. We outline a research strategy that investigates the relation between speech initiation/cessation and the control and coordination of articulation. Speech may start, pause, or cease for a variety of reasons in addition to linguistically structured phrase edges. Some breaks in the speech stream may be cognitively ""planned,"" such as interlocutor turn-taking in discourse. Other disruptions in the speech stream might be ""unplanned,"" such as interruptions and word finding challenges. Our approach investigates the articulation of speech in the vocal tract at turn-taking and interruptions in structured dialogue and in the vicinity of pauses that occur for cognitive speech planning reasons. We complement this experimental work with computational modeling of phrasal junctures and pauses, and with machine learning approaches to classifying breaks in speech arising from differing sources. The specific aims will be pursued by using articulatory movement data collected with magnetometer systems for tracking movement inside the mouth and by using our team's computational model of speech production.

"SPEECH MOVEMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR ASSESSING AND TREATING ALS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is advance the assessment and treatment of speech motor impairments due to ALS using novel computer-based approaches. Recently developed speech movement tracking technology will be used to record movements of tongue, lips, and jaw in 50 persons with ALS and 50 healthy control participants. The speech movement data will be analyzed using custom machine learning algorithms to address three important translational needs in person with ALS: improved early detection of speech motor involvement, improved progress monitoring of speech motor decline, and improved options for maintaining oral communication. The established interdisciplinary team with expertise in data mining, speech- language pathology, clinical neurology, and spatial statistics are well positioned to conduct this research. If successful, the specific aims have the potential to transform clinical practice for speech-language pathologists, neurologists, and other related health care professionals. The propose research will enhance human health by making an impact on individuals with speech motor impairment due to ALS and potentially to a broad range of other speech motor due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, and orofacial or laryngeal cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ALS is one of the most common motor neuron diseases. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, approximately 30,000 Americans are living with ALS (NINDS, 2003). Recent evidence suggests ALS incidence is increasing in the general population (Strong & Rosenfeld, 2003), particularly among Gulf War veterans who are nearly twice as likely to develop the disease as veterans not deployed to the Gulf (Haley, 2003). This project is focused on the development and validation of novel machine-learning based tools for improving the assessment and treatment of patients with speech motor impairments due to ALS. If successful, this research may (1) improve early detection and prognostic accuracy, (2) and address the critical need for objective outcome measures for ongoing experimental drug trials, and (3) provide information to develop a novel oral communication device for persons with moderate to severe speech impairment. These developments may ameliorate the socioeconomic burden of speech motor impairments as well as the quality of life for these patients, their families, and the people they closely interact wit.                    ",SPEECH MOVEMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR ASSESSING AND TREATING ALS,8613983,R01DC013547,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysarthria', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetics', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Language', 'Life', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Oral', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Synthesizers', 'Speech-Language Pathology', 'Staging', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Wit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'forging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'jaw movement', 'motor impairment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral communication', 'orofacial', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,R01,2014,642629,0.29564149814672025
"Multimodal Speech Translation for Assistive Communication     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysarthria, a neuromotor speech disorder impacting over 4 million Americans, is often so severe that speech is rendered unintelligible, requiring the use of augmentative and/or alternative communication (AAC) devices. These devices are dated, cumbersome and bulky. Rather than engaging in face-to-face interaction, AAC users spend a disproportionate amount of time navigating through menus of letters/icons to compose a message, which can then be spoken aloud by an integrated text-to-speech synthesis system. Thus AAC interactions are slow, effortful, unnatural, and often hinder rather than support social, educational and vocational opportunities. In fact, many AAC users continue to vocalize with familiar caregivers implying that consistent patterns must underlie dysarthric productions. It is these imprecise yet consistent productions that we propose to capture via multimodal sensors and classify using pattern recognition algorithms for speech translation. While automatic speech recognition is a viable technology for neurologically intact speakers or those with mild impairments, it fails in acoustically harsh speaking contexts and for those with more severe dysarthria. Instead, we focus on multimodal (lingual kinematic and acoustic; LinKA) representations of speech as they provide redundant and complementary channels of input for improved disambiguation. While other approaches have used computer vision, ultrasound imaging and electromyography to simultaneously estimate articulatory and acoustic parameters of speech, they are limited in portability, cost, and application to clinical settings. The current proposal leverages a novel, lightweight, wearable and low-cost array of magnetic sensors near the cheeks that can recognize the magnetic field patterns generated by a small magnetic tracer placed on the tongue to capture lingual kinematics during speech. Coupling tongue movements with the acoustic signal, captured via microphones mounted on the same headset, provides a multidimensional representation of speech that can then be translated into clear understandable speech for a new generation of wearable, speech-driven AAC devices. The proposed work will optimize the efficiency and robustness of lingual-kinematic and acoustic sensing for mobile speech translation (Aim 1), yield a standardized implementation protocol for training and independent use of the LinKA system (Aim 2), and culminate in a 2-week field test of the LinKA translator with 12 potential users with speech impairment (Aim 3). The current proposal is a first and essential step toward a low-cost, wearable, personalized communication enhancement system that can broaden communication opportunities and networks for individuals with speech impairment and thereby increase communication participation, independence and overall quality of life.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuromotor speech disorders limit communication opportunities and access to social, educational and employment activities for nearly 4 million Americans. The LinKA (Lingual Kinematic and Acoustic) system is the first low-cost, wireless and wearable technology to simultaneously capture tongue movements and corresponding acoustics of speech. Coupling multimodal speech detection with sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms and an intelligent user interface, we propose to develop the LinKA Translator - an enabling technology that would disambiguate disordered productions and translate them into clear, understandable speech to broaden communication networks for individuals with speech disorder and thereby increase quality of life and independence.            ",Multimodal Speech Translation for Assistive Communication,8737379,R21EB018764,"['Acoustics', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication device', 'Caregivers', 'Cheek structure', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Interface', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dysarthria', 'Electromyography', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Generations', 'Hawks', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Magnetism', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reliance', 'Running', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Social support', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Disorders', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Wheelchairs', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'alternative communication', 'coping', 'cost', 'design', 'deviant', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'kinematics', 'magnetic field', 'novel', 'phrases', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sensor', 'social', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,97475,0.32136761715055334
"Longitudinal Voice Patterns in Bipolar Disorder     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research study will identify changes in acoustic speech parameters, using innovative cell phone based technology, in order to predict clinically significant mood state transitions in individuals with bipolar disorder. The central hypothesis is that there are quantitative changes in acoustic speech patterns that occur in advance of clinically observed mood changes. These changes is speech patterns can be identified using computational methods over longitudinal monitoring of ecologically gathered voice data that requires minimal input from the individual being observed. These computationally determined changes are imperceptible to human observation but are hypothesized to predict clinically significant mood transitions. To test this hypothesis we will study 50 rapid cycling individuals with bipolar I and II disorder and 10 healthy controls for 6 months by recording their acoustic characteristics of speech (not lexical content) while using a mobile ""smart- phone"". In this manner we are gathering data free of observer bias. We will also gather weekly clinical assessments with standardized instruments (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale) in which we will record their physical voice patterns as well. Bipolar disorder is an ideal disorder for the initial study of speech patterns in the assessment of psychopathology. It is an illness with pathological disruptions of emotion, cognitive and motor capacity. There is a periodicity of the illness pattern that oscillates between manic energized states with charged emotions and pressured rapid speech to depressed emotional phases with retarded movements and inhibited quality and quantity of speech. The successful management of patients with bipolar disorder requires ongoing clinical monitoring of mental states. Currently there are few technologies that address the challenge of monitoring individuals long-term in an ecological manner. Speech pattern recognition technology would allow for unobtrusive monitoring that can be seamlessly integrated into daily routine of mobile phone usage to predict future changes in illness states. The proposed study tests a highly innovative approach by developing a practical solution to assist in the longitudinal management of bipolar patients. Computational algorithms of analyzed speech patterns will use statistic (Gausian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling. This project has the potential of transformative advances in the management of psychiatric disease, as speech patterns, and changes therein, are highly likely to be reflective of current and emerging psychopathology. If successful this technology will provide for the prioritization of patients for medical and psychiatric care based on computational detection of change patterns in voice and speech before they are clinically observable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study that detects measurable changes in speech patterns using computer-based analyses and correlates these changes with pathological variation in clinically assessed mood states. Changes in speech patterns are likely to precede and predict clinically significant mood state changes (to mania or depression). The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of mood changes that will provide the opportunity for early clinical intervention.                ",Longitudinal Voice Patterns in Bipolar Disorder,8658149,R34MH100404,"['Accent', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Bipolar II', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observer Variation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Periodicity', 'Personality', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Secure', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar mania', 'clinically significant', 'digital', 'heuristics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'lexical', 'markov model', 'mental state', 'pressure', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'speech processing', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R34,2014,272125,0.22586013548923137
"Applying Computational Linguistics to Fundamental Components of Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a uniquely human disorder with specific effects on the uniquely human capacity of language. Indeed, the gross and subtle language abnormalities of schizophrenia can be seen as fundamental illness components, perhaps even as part of a ""biosignature."" Bringing modern linguistics knowledge and tools to this disorder is a promising approach. We have formed a unique, inter-disciplinary collaboration (Dr. Compton, a schizophrenia researcher; Dr. Covington, a computational linguist; Dr. Lunden, a linguist specializing in phonetics; Dr. Cleary, a statistician; and Dr. Blanchard, an expert in measuring negative symptoms) to study some of the most perplexing and disabling facets of schizophrenia, the language/speech abnormalities linked closely to disorganization and negative symptoms. We will analyze speech abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and unaffected controls. Rather than examining a single linguistic parameter, we will assess speech in ""syntactic,"" ""semantic,"" ""pragmatic,"" and ""phonetic"" domains of linguistics. We will introduce cutting- edge innovation to this area of study by assessing these indices using psycholinguistics software developed by Dr. Covington's group so that our ratings of speech abnormalities will be highly objective and ultra-reliable.  Our long-term goal is to develop multivariable models, and new methods for clinical and research settings, based on computational linguistic indices with inherent reliability from automation and proven validity. In this exploratory/developmental study, we will collect detailed symptom ratings from 100 schizophrenia patients, as well as audio-recorded speech samples and neurocognition scores from these patients and 100 controls. This study involves early/conceptual stages of new tools and models that could have a major translational impact. We strive to acquire new knowledge and then put it into action. For example, our new methods could translate into advanced clinical applications (e.g., highly reliable, voice-based monitoring of symptom progression or remission). Furthermore, our new models and methods could be a first step toward promising predictive models (e.g., combinations of factors useful in risk prediction among at-risk youth). These objectives are highly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan. Our 4 aims are to: (1) examine syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic linguistic parameters using computer analysis of speech, and assess their relation to disorganized symptoms; (2) examine phonetic linguistic parameters using computerized Fourier spectrum analysis of speech, and assess their relation to negative symptoms; (3) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts patient versus control status; and (4) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts disorganization scores and negative symptom scores among patients. Given the rich data we will collect, we will also be able to covary the effects of medication and substance use; examine variation in findings based on neutral v. emotionally laden content and spontaneous v. read speech; assess variance in linguistic measures attributable to cognitive domains; and compare results in first-episode and chronic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia is an etiologically complex, heterogeneous mental disorder-ranking among the top 10 causes of disability worldwide-with those affected contending with troubling symptoms, major psychosocial problems, unparalleled societal stigma, health disparities, diverse comorbidities, and an average lifespan reduction of 25 years. We propose a study that would significantly advance knowledge of fundamental but under-studied components of the illness-speech/language abnormalities-by examining a broad array of linguistic indices using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (computational linguistics, or computrs objectively, quickly, and ultra- reliably analyzing speech). This exploratory/developmental work could have major public health significance in terms of potential for future, high-impact clinical assessment tools that can be practicably used in routine practice settings, as well as future predictive models for those at high risk of developing schizophrenia.",Applying Computational Linguistics to Fundamental Components of Schizophrenia,8792658,R21MH097999,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Exhibits', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Oral cavity', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phonetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sound Spectrography', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Strategic Planning', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Tongue', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biosignature', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'neglect', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'routine practice', 'social stigma', 'software development', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R21,2014,192679,0.14533271201759393
"Video-based Speech Enhancement for Persons with Vision and Hearing Loss     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Video-based Speech Enhancement for Persons with Hearing and Vision Loss Project Summary It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people in the United States over the age of 65 will account for over 20% of the total population.  Hearing and vision loss naturally accompanies the aging process.  Persons with hearing loss can benefit from observing the visual cues from a speaker such as the shape of the lips and facial expression to greatly improve their ability to comprehend speech.  However, persons with vision loss cannot make use of these visual cues, and have a harder time understanding speech, especially in noisy environments.  Furthermore, people with normal vision can use visual information to identify a speaker in a group, which allows them to focus on this person.  This can greatly benefit a person with hearing loss who may be using a device such as a sound amplifier or a hearing aid.  A user with vision loss, however, needs to be provided with this speaker information to make optimal use of such devices.  We propose developing a prototype device that will clean the speech signal from a target speaker and improve speech comprehension for persons with hearing and vision loss in everyday situations.  In order to accomplish this task, we need to harness the visual cues that have so far largely been ignored in the design of assistive technolo- gies for persons with hearing loss.  Our first aim is to learn speaker-independent visual cues that are associated with the target speech signal, and use these audio-visual cues to design speech enhancement algorithms that perform much better in noisy everyday environment than current methods which only utilize the audio signal.  We will utilize a video camera and computer vision methods to design advanced digital signal processing techniques to enhance the target speech signals recorded through a microphone.  Our second aim is to use the video and audio signals to detect and efficiently localize the visible speaker.  The information regarding the location of the speaker of interest can then be used to efficiently perform speaker separation, as well as be provided to the user.  Finally, we aim to implement these developed algorithms on a portable prototype system.  We will test the performance of this system and improve the user-interface through user experiments in real-world situations as well as laboratory conditions.  The end product will show the feasibility and importance of incorporating multiple modalities into sensory assistive devices, and set the stage for future research and development efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It is estimated that by 2030, more than one in five people in the United States will be over the age of 65.

"Longitudinal Voice Patterns in Bipolar Disorder     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research study will identify changes in acoustic speech parameters, using innovative cell phone based technology, in order to predict clinically significant mood state transitions in individuals with bipolar disorder. The central hypothesis is that there are quantitative changes in acoustic speech patterns that occur in advance of clinically observed mood changes. These changes is speech patterns can be identified using computational methods over longitudinal monitoring of ecologically gathered voice data that requires minimal input from the individual being observed. These computationally determined changes are imperceptible to human observation but are hypothesized to predict clinically significant mood transitions. To test this hypothesis we will study 50 rapid cycling individuals with bipolar I and II disorder and 10 healthy controls for 6 months by recording their acoustic characteristics of speech (not lexical content) while using a mobile ""smart- phone"". In this manner we are gathering data free of observer bias. We will also gather weekly clinical assessments with standardized instruments (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale) in which we will record their physical voice patterns as well. Bipolar disorder is an ideal disorder for the initial study of speech patterns in the assessment of psychopathology. It is an illness with pathological disruptions of emotion, cognitive and motor capacity. There is a periodicity of the illness pattern that oscillates between manic energized states with charged emotions and pressured rapid speech to depressed emotional phases with retarded movements and inhibited quality and quantity of speech. The successful management of patients with bipolar disorder requires ongoing clinical monitoring of mental states. Currently there are few technologies that address the challenge of monitoring individuals long-term in an ecological manner. Speech pattern recognition technology would allow for unobtrusive monitoring that can be seamlessly integrated into daily routine of mobile phone usage to predict future changes in illness states. The proposed study tests a highly innovative approach by developing a practical solution to assist in the longitudinal management of bipolar patients. Computational algorithms of analyzed speech patterns will use statistic (Gausian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling. This project has the potential of transformative advances in the management of psychiatric disease, as speech patterns, and changes therein, are highly likely to be reflective of current and emerging psychopathology. If successful this technology will provide for the prioritization of patients for medical and psychiatric care based on computational detection of change patterns in voice and speech before they are clinically observable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study that detects measurable changes in speech patterns using computer-based analyses and correlates these changes with pathological variation in clinically assessed mood states. Changes in speech patterns are likely to precede and predict clinically significant mood state changes (to mania or depression). The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of mood changes that will provide the opportunity for early clinical intervention.                ",Longitudinal Voice Patterns in Bipolar Disorder,8494970,R34MH100404,"['Accent', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observer Variation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Periodicity', 'Personality', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Secure', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'digital', 'heuristics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'lexical', 'markov model', 'mental state', 'pressure', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'speech processing', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R34,2013,272125,0.22586013548923137
"Longitudinal Analysis of Spoken Language Characteristics in the Nun Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Verbal communication is one of the most complex and vital human behaviors negatively affected by neurodegenerative disease, and previous research strongly suggests that linguistic characteristics are promising as early clinical indicators. The Nun Study data set offers a rare opportunity to investigate the application of linguistic methods to the assessment of late life cognitive deficits and the development of neurodegenerative disease. We propose to investigate rate of decline in linguistic ability using previously unanalyzed spoken autobiography audio samples repeated over four waves of assessment. Aim 1 will capitalize on work already done to digitize audio recordings of the Nun Study longitudinal spoken autobiography samples. Verbatim transcripts will be produced and will be time-aligned with the audio from each speech sample. Aim 2 will use computational linguistic methods to calculate measures of syntactic complexity and propositional content, and will evaluate the rate of change on these measures over the 41/2 year follow-up period. Mean rates of change will be estimated in those sisters with repeated speech samples available, and will be compared between those sisters with and without dementia to determine if the rate of decline in linguistic ability is associated with diagnostic status. This project leverages the extensive NIH resources already invested in the Nun Study to 1) analyze an under-utilized aspect of this valuable data set, 2) expand upon the study's early findings in the application of linguistic analysis to the study of aging and disease-development, and 3) update the analysis methodology applied to the autobiography samples by making use of automated methods from the field of computational linguistics to combine information about speech content with information from the audio recording. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Nun Study data set offers a rare opportunity to study speech quality in the development of dementia. This study will investigate rate of decline in linguistic ability using previously unanalyzed spoken autobiography audio samples from the Nun Study.

"Applying Computational Linguistics to Fundamental Components of Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a uniquely human disorder with specific effects on the uniquely human capacity of language. Indeed, the gross and subtle language abnormalities of schizophrenia can be seen as fundamental illness components, perhaps even as part of a ""biosignature."" Bringing modern linguistics knowledge and tools to this disorder is a promising approach. We have formed a unique, inter-disciplinary collaboration (Dr. Compton, a schizophrenia researcher; Dr. Covington, a computational linguist; Dr. Lunden, a linguist specializing in phonetics; Dr. Cleary, a statistician; and Dr. Blanchard, an expert in measuring negative symptoms) to study some of the most perplexing and disabling facets of schizophrenia, the language/speech abnormalities linked closely to disorganization and negative symptoms. We will analyze speech abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and unaffected controls. Rather than examining a single linguistic parameter, we will assess speech in ""syntactic,"" ""semantic,"" ""pragmatic,"" and ""phonetic"" domains of linguistics. We will introduce cutting- edge innovation to this area of study by assessing these indices using psycholinguistics software developed by Dr. Covington's group so that our ratings of speech abnormalities will be highly objective and ultra-reliable.  Our long-term goal is to develop multivariable models, and new methods for clinical and research settings, based on computational linguistic indices with inherent reliability from automation and proven validity. In this exploratory/developmental study, we will collect detailed symptom ratings from 100 schizophrenia patients, as well as audio-recorded speech samples and neurocognition scores from these patients and 100 controls. This study involves early/conceptual stages of new tools and models that could have a major translational impact. We strive to acquire new knowledge and then put it into action. For example, our new methods could translate into advanced clinical applications (e.g., highly reliable, voice-based monitoring of symptom progression or remission). Furthermore, our new models and methods could be a first step toward promising predictive models (e.g., combinations of factors useful in risk prediction among at-risk youth). These objectives are highly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan. Our 4 aims are to: (1) examine syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic linguistic parameters using computer analysis of speech, and assess their relation to disorganized symptoms; (2) examine phonetic linguistic parameters using computerized Fourier spectrum analysis of speech, and assess their relation to negative symptoms; (3) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts patient versus control status; and (4) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts disorganization scores and negative symptom scores among patients. Given the rich data we will collect, we will also be able to covary the effects of medication and substance use; examine variation in findings based on neutral v. emotionally laden content and spontaneous v. read speech; assess variance in linguistic measures attributable to cognitive domains; and compare results in first-episode and chronic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia is an etiologically complex, heterogeneous mental disorder-ranking among the top 10 causes of disability worldwide-with those affected contending with troubling symptoms, major psychosocial problems, unparalleled societal stigma, health disparities, diverse comorbidities, and an average lifespan reduction of 25 years. We propose a study that would significantly advance knowledge of fundamental but under-studied components of the illness-speech/language abnormalities-by examining a broad array of linguistic indices using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (computational linguistics, or computrs objectively, quickly, and ultra- reliably analyzing speech). This exploratory/developmental work could have major public health significance in terms of potential for future, high-impact clinical assessment tools that can be practicably used in routine practice settings, as well as future predictive models for those at high risk of developing schizophrenia.            ",Applying Computational Linguistics to Fundamental Components of Schizophrenia,8512143,R21MH097999,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Exhibits', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Oral cavity', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phonetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sound Spectrography', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Strategic Planning', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Tongue', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biosignature', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'neglect', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'routine practice', 'social stigma', 'software development', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,249349,0.14533271201759393
"Speech Prosody and Articulatory Dynamics in Spoken Language     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One powerfully communicative aspect of language is prosody, which is the use of pitch, loudness, local rate modulation, and pauses in speech to signal its informational and affective content. Speech production deficits due to neurological damage such as stroke or due to Autism Spectrum Disorder are often characterized by prosodic irregularities. The long term objective of the proposed research program is to understand how linguistic structure and communicative context condition the spatiotemporal realization of articulatory movement during speaking. Our linguist-engineer team studies the ""signatures"" of prosody at the level of articulatory patterning. The specific aims of this proposal are to understand and model how speakers differentially modulate the spatiotemporal organization of articulatory gestures as a function of the cognitive source of a break in the speech stream and how the communicative context influences the temporal flow of the speech stream in articulation as speakers interact with one another. We outline a research strategy that investigates the relation between speech initiation/cessation and the control and coordination of articulation. Speech may start, pause, or cease for a variety of reasons in addition to linguistically structured phrase edges. Some breaks in the speech stream may be cognitively ""planned,"" such as interlocutor turn-taking in discourse. Other disruptions in the speech stream might be ""unplanned,"" such as interruptions and word finding challenges. Our approach investigates the articulation of speech in the vocal tract at turn-taking and interruptions in structured dialogue and in the vicinity of pauses that occur for cognitive speech planning reasons. We complement this experimental work with computational modeling of phrasal junctures and pauses, and with machine learning approaches to classifying breaks in speech arising from differing sources. The specific aims will be pursued by using articulatory movement data collected with magnetometer systems for tracking movement inside the mouth and by using our team's computational model of speech production. The experiment work and the concomitant computational modeling of the articulatory findings will provide a profile of the manner in which articulatory patterning is shapd by the larger informational structuring of utterances and by the demands of speech planning in a communicative context.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One powerfully communicative aspect of language is prosody, which is the use of pitch, loudness, and temporal properties such as pauses in speech to signal its informational and affective content. Speech production deficits due to neurological damage such as stroke or due to Autism Spectrum Disorder are often characterized by prosodic irregularities and understanding the influence of structural prosody and its deployment in communication on the temporal flow of speech can have critical translational impact in that disfluencies are typically used as a basis for diagnosis of speech disorders. Our research uses instrumental tracking of articulatory movements during speech to provide an understanding of normative production of modulation and pauses in speech flow that could support evidence-driven assessments and treatments of prosodic breakdown in clinical populations, including deploying assistive technologies for the impaired such as automatic speech recognition and machine speech synthesis.              One powerfully communicative aspect of language is prosody, which is the use of pitch, loudness, and temporal properties such as pauses in speech to signal its informational and affective content.

"Speech Therapy Robot (STR) to assist in the administration of evidence based spee    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR phase I project will develop a Speech Therapy Robot (STR) to assist in the administration of evidence-based speech and language therapy to provide individualized monitoring of multiple clients simultaneously in a school setting. STR will use biologically plausible artificial intelligence models to prototype a system that is affordable, easy to use, portable and extensible to work with any number of students (clients) with disorder. Most children make some mistakes as they learn to say new words, but a speech sound disorder results when mistakes continue past a certain age. Speech sound disorders include problems with articulation (making sounds) and phonological processes (sound patterns), and it is one of the largest disabilities in the United States. Children with speech disorders are evaluated by a speech-language pathologist (SLP) and treated via speech-language intervention within the child's classroom (classroom-based) or outside of the classroom (pull-out). Multiple studies have demonstrated that classroom-based service is beneficial over pull- out service, but currently it is not widely practiced because of the many challenges facing SLPs: 1) it requires collaboration with classroom teachers and administrators who are not trained in speech-language pathology, 2) it can create a larger client-SLP ratio, 3) a small client-nonclient student in-class ratio, 4) unable to provide adequate intervention, 5) there is a large variation in severity of disorder within clients, 6) longer session hours over pull-out service. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) recommendations caseloads should not exceed 40, but the median caseload is 50 in elementary and secondary schools, with high of 80 clients. This heavy workload for an SLP limits their capacity to provide effective treatment. Thus a robotic system capable of reducing the workload and assisting SLPs to provide improved individual care is highly desired by those in this field. In this Phase I SBIR, we will develop novel biologically plausible models to address these challenges by developing a robot-assisted therapy system capable of real time monitoring and assessment of client and client-provider interaction during the session, to determine client engagement, performance and to give feedback to providers in real time for improved treatment delivery. The biological models attempt to mimic the expert diagnostic capabilities of a SLP and extend it for use by non-SLPs to work with multiple clients at the same time. The solution will not require specialized training to use, allowing teachers to easily use it in their classrooms. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of STR. STR is not just a minor improvement over existing technologies but a technology and application that do not exist today. In Phase II, we will extend the capabilities towards a fully biologically plausible system to mimic expert human performance levels to develop a robotic system for speech-language therapy, this will be followed by clinical trials to ensure accuracy, efficacy of STR to facilitate evidence-based therapy. Variations of the system can be used towards phonology, morphology/syntax, pragmatics, language, fluency and/or vocabulary.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Overall the project provides direct relevance to public health by facilitating new insights through the development of a novel biologically plausible artificial intelligence system capable of real time monitoring and assessment of verbal therapy session content in real time to determine patient engagement, performance and give feedback to providers in real time to improve treatment delivery, in a school setting. The novel biologically plausible device will significantly impact the current known methods of in classroom evaluation, monitoring and treatment of speech disorders. The project can help in substantial improvement in patient client interaction, better treatment, lower burden on speech language pathologists, and will significantly impact the current known methods, technologies, treatments, and address critical barriers to progress in the field.           Overall the project provides direct relevance to public health by facilitating new insights through the development of a novel biologically plausible artificial intelligence system capable of real time monitoring and assessment of verbal therapy session content in real time to determine patient engagement, performance and give feedback to providers in real time to improve treatment delivery, in a school setting.

"Development of Speech Perception and Brain Plasticity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Language is a hallmark of human beings. In the last 50 years, debates on language have given way to a new view of the process by which humans acquire language. One catalyst for theoretical change has been empirical studies on infants. In the last decade, researchers have not only charted when infants acquire knowledge about the properties of their native language, but how they do so, and this has caused a revision in linguistic and psychological theories. New research focuses on the phonetic units of speech, the consonants and vowels that form building blocks for words. Key advances from this laboratory are cross- language data showing that infants learn from exposure to language in the earliest periods of development and that this alters speech perception to assist language learning. Moreover, our studies show that early speech predicts later language, and that the clarity of mothers' infant-directed speech is linked to infants' speech perception abilities. Finally, brain measures on infants and adults listening to language suggest that, during early development, the infant brain ""neurally commits"" to the patterns of native language speech and that this both promotes future language learning as well as the decline in nonnative speech perception that occurs at the end of the first year of life. This work on early speech perception is impacting child development, neuroscience, neurobiology, and computational modeling. The early speech measures developed as a part of this project are being used in the study of developmental disabilities including autism, and may provide an early marker of the disability. The data prompted an extension of the Native Language Magnet model to incorporate neural commitment as the mechanism for developmental change. This theoretical position provides the background and framework for the studies in this proposal. Four converging lines of research are proposed to test the theory and further advance our knowledge of infant speech development: (a) speech perception development and its impact on language; (b) the brain correlates of early speech and language development, (c) the role of language input to children, and (d) brain plasticity and the ""critical period"" for language acquisition. The research will produce data that address theories of speech and language development and more general theories of the interface between biology and culture.           n/a",Development of Speech Perception and Brain Plasticity,8044743,R01HD037954,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Audiotape', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Commit', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phonetics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Theory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Speech Development', 'Speech Perception', 'Techniques', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'catalyst', 'critical period', 'design', 'disability', 'foreign language', 'infancy', 'language processing', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'speech processing', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2011,526418,0.12841245110093377
"Intonation in spontaneous English & Japanese dialogue    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spoken dialogue is 1 of the most basic forms of human language, ubiquitous across cultures. It differs in form from written language and read speech, with different vocabulary usage, different syntax, and an expanded use of visually available context. Most importantly, speakers and hearers of dialogue must rely on intonation, or the 'melody in speech.' When we talk, we manipulate the pitch, rate, phrasing, and volume of our speech. Patterns of intonation across a conversation can indicate complex discourse information not available from the words alone, such as what is already known by both speakers, what is newly introduced to 1 or both of them, which information they are finished discussing and what is still to be talked about. Although intonational structuring of discourse information is reported for numerous languages, a theory of the general cognitive mechanism underlying the universal use of intonation has yet to be established. The cross-linguistic research proposed here is crucial for the development of a general theory of intonation use in human language processing. The focus on analyses of unscripted conversational speech provides the most accurate information available about basic human language performance. Studying spontaneous speech has been considered an intractable problem, because it is hard to predict the specific words and sentence structures a speaker will use. We have piloted novel methodology that allows collection of multiple tokens of like utterances from the same speaker in varying intonational conditions. To understand how listeners respond in conversation, we use head-mounted eye-movement monitoring, an immediate, implicit measure of comprehension that allows the listener to speak and move while looking at the objects described by a conversational partner. The comparisons of English and Japanese, 2 languages that differ substantially in their syntax and intonation, test whether intonation is used differently in a language that provides melodic cues more or less reliably, and in different physical forms. Understanding how consistently intonation marks the information status of words and whether intonational cues facilitate listeners' comprehension of messages is important, not only for theories of language processing and development, but also for accurate speech identification and generation systems in artificial intelligence, and for the development of effective diagnoses and therapies for aphasic patients and others with communication loss.          n/a",Intonation in spontaneous English & Japanese dialogue,8100589,R01DC007090,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Eye Movements', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Instruction', 'Japanese Population', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phonetics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Vocabulary', 'Writing', 'aphasic', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'efficacy research', 'improved', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'phonology', 'phrases', 'programs', 'research study', 'speech accuracy', 'syntax', 'theories', 'transmission process']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,211698,0.14150772928331604
"Sensitivity to spectral cues in infant speech perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine infants' sensitivity to multiple spectral cues in speech perception. Speech is a complex signal, with numerous acoustic cues for every consonant and vowel. Through experience, listeners learn to exploit correlations between multiple cues, making perception more efficient and robust. Adults display this knowledge through their use of cues that are spectrally local (e.g. formant transitions) as well as distributed (e.g. gross spectral shape, or tilt) to distinguish speech sounds. Although prior research has demonstrated infants' ability to distinguish many speech sounds, how they distinguish these sounds is unclear. Infants' sensitivity to individual cues, the relative importance they assign to each cue, and when they learn to exploit correlations between cues all remain poorly understood. We propose four experiments to address these questions. The first aim of this project is to investigate sensitivity to spectral cues. To address this issue, the first two experiments will examine speech perception when the natural covariance between two cues is violated or maintained. The latter two experiments will test sensitivity to changes in individual cues. The second aim is to assess relative cue salience across the lifespan. Results from the first experiment will be compared to existing data from normal-hearing and hearing-impaired elderly adult listeners who completed a similar task (Alexander & Kluender, in press; in preparation) to assess differential effects of listening experience and hearing health on perception of the same speech stimuli. We hypothesize that both 6-to-7-month-old and 11-to-12-month-old-infants will exhibit perceptual sensitivity to both spectral cues in speech perception, with 11-to-12-month-olds displaying the greatest sensitivity. We also hypothesize that younger infants may be relatively more influenced by spectrally global (e.g. tilt) cues than older infants. Our long-term objective is to better understand development of speech perception in infants with normal and compromised hearing. These results will help refine treatment methods for infants with hearing loss, and inform the use of devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants. Public health statement: The proposed research will reveal the acoustic information infants use to distinguish speech sounds, and whether this information is used differently by adults. Knowing what infants listen for will benefit efforts to facilitate development of speech perception in children with compromised hearing. This research will also investigate when infants learn to exploit statistical regularities between cues in natural speech.             n/a",Sensitivity to spectral cues in infant speech perception,7860410,F31DC009532,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Voice', 'Weight', 'base', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'infancy', 'research study', 'response', 'sound']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2010,27620,0.18163628511956356
"Development of Speech Perception and Brain Plasticity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Language is a hallmark of human beings. In the last 50 years, debates on language have given way to a new view of the process by which humans acquire language. One catalyst for theoretical change has been empirical studies on infants. In the last decade, researchers have not only charted when infants acquire knowledge about the properties of their native language, but how they do so, and this has caused a revision in linguistic and psychological theories. New research focuses on the phonetic units of speech, the consonants and vowels that form building blocks for words. Key advances from this laboratory are cross- language data showing that infants learn from exposure to language in the earliest periods of development and that this alters speech perception to assist language learning. Moreover, our studies show that early speech predicts later language, and that the clarity of mothers' infant-directed speech is linked to infants' speech perception abilities. Finally, brain measures on infants and adults listening to language suggest that, during early development, the infant brain ""neurally commits"" to the patterns of native language speech and that this both promotes future language learning as well as the decline in nonnative speech perception that occurs at the end of the first year of life. This work on early speech perception is impacting child development, neuroscience, neurobiology, and computational modeling. The early speech measures developed as a part of this project are being used in the study of developmental disabilities including autism, and may provide an early marker of the disability. The data prompted an extension of the Native Language Magnet model to incorporate neural commitment as the mechanism for developmental change. This theoretical position provides the background and framework for the studies in this proposal.

"Intonation in spontaneous English & Japanese dialogue    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spoken dialogue is 1 of the most basic forms of human language, ubiquitous across cultures. It differs in form from written language and read speech, with different vocabulary usage, different syntax, and an expanded use of visually available context. Most importantly, speakers and hearers of dialogue must rely on intonation, or the 'melody in speech.' When we talk, we manipulate the pitch, rate, phrasing, and volume of our speech. Patterns of intonation across a conversation can indicate complex discourse information not available from the words alone, such as what is already known by both speakers, what is newly introduced to 1 or both of them, which information they are finished discussing and what is still to be talked about. Although intonational structuring of discourse information is reported for numerous languages, a theory of the general cognitive mechanism underlying the universal use of intonation has yet to be established. The cross-linguistic research proposed here is crucial for the development of a general theory of intonation use in human language processing. The focus on analyses of unscripted conversational speech provides the most accurate information available about basic human language performance. Studying spontaneous speech has been considered an intractable problem, because it is hard to predict the specific words and sentence structures a speaker will use. We have piloted novel methodology that allows collection of multiple tokens of like utterances from the same speaker in varying intonational conditions. To understand how listeners respond in conversation, we use head-mounted eye-movement monitoring, an immediate, implicit measure of comprehension that allows the listener to speak and move while looking at the objects described by a conversational partner. The comparisons of English and Japanese, 2 languages that differ substantially in their syntax and intonation, test whether intonation is used differently in a language that provides melodic cues more or less reliably, and in different physical forms. Understanding how consistently intonation marks the information status of words and whether intonational cues facilitate listeners' comprehension of messages is important, not only for theories of language processing and development, but also for accurate speech identification and generation systems in artificial intelligence, and for the development of effective diagnoses and therapies for aphasic patients and others with communication loss.          n/a",Intonation in spontaneous English & Japanese dialogue,7643857,R01DC007090,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Eye Movements', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Instruction', 'Japanese Population', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phonetics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Vocabulary', 'Writing', 'aphasic', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'efficacy research', 'improved', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'phonology', 'phrases', 'programs', 'research study', 'speech accuracy', 'syntax', 'theories', 'transmission process']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,213837,0.14150772928331604
"Neuromotor Modeling of Adductor Spasmodic Dysphonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to create a laryngeal neuromotor model of adductor spasmodic dysphonia (SD), a chronic and often debilitating vocal disorder. We will achieve this goal by identifying specific motoneuron firing patterns that occur during vocal spasm by applying recently-developed multidimensional electromyographic technologies to laryngeal muscles. A neuromotor model of SD will serve to characterize the disorder at the motor nucleus. Neuromotor models, in turn, facilitate parallel research in fields of neuroimaging and drug treatment. Speech requires the coordinated control of multiple muscles by the central nervous system, from diaphragm to lips - with larynx playing a principal role in the phonatory process. Skeletal muscles are controlled by two mechanisms: the recruitment of motoneurons and modulation of motoneuron firing rates. Characterization of laryngeal muscle control at the level of the motoneuron is important toward our understanding of normal speech motor control and of neurologic speech motor disorders. Although studied for many decades, the cause of spasmodic dysphonia has remained elusive. Findings of neuroimaging, genetics, and physiology - including conventional electromyography - have been inconsistent and therefore inconclusive about the neural underpinnings of SD. Irrespective of the heterogeneity of findings using conventional modalities, the central participant in SD is the vocal spasm, and therefore we turn the fine lens offered by the imaging of multiple motoneuron firing activities upon these spasms. We hypothesize that vocal spasms are characterized by episodic increases in new motoneuron firing activity and that these new activities are disordered in firing rate characteristics with the existing pool and among themselves. We will test this hypothesis by obtaining motoneuron firing plots of an intralaryngeal muscle: thyroarytenoid. Motoneuron firing plots contain firing activities of multiple motoneurons simultaneously and in their correct temporal relations. Features of recruitment, correlation, synchronicity, and oscillation during vocal spasm will be compared to periods of non-spasm and to control features of a normal control population. Neuromuscular disorders that disrupt speech affect a sizeable population and often seriously impair the professional, social and family interactions of the affected individual. In applying recent advances in multi-dimensional physiologic and artificial intelligence technologies, this project will formulate models of vocal motor control at the level of the brainstem that improve our understanding of speech production in the normal population and of a voice disorder called spasmodic dysphonia. Knowledge gained from this research aims to assist the development of drug therapy to treat spasmodic dysphonia and other neuromuscular speech disorders.           n/a",Neuromotor Modeling of Adductor Spasmodic Dysphonia,7535517,R21DC008786,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electromyography', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Lip structure', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Muscle', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thyroarytenoid Muscle', 'Voice Disorders', 'improved', 'lens', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromuscular', 'relating to nervous system', 'social']",NIDCD,NEW YORK MEDICAL COLLEGE,R21,2009,201958,0.15734022568864398
"Sensitivity to spectral cues in infant speech perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine infants' sensitivity to multiple spectral cues in speech perception. Speech is a complex signal, with numerous acoustic cues for every consonant and vowel. Through experience, listeners learn to exploit correlations between multiple cues, making perception more efficient and robust. Adults display this knowledge through their use of cues that are spectrally local (e.g. formant transitions) as well as distributed (e.g. gross spectral shape, or tilt) to distinguish speech sounds. Although prior research has demonstrated infants' ability to distinguish many speech sounds, how they distinguish these sounds is unclear. Infants' sensitivity to individual cues, the relative importance they assign to each cue, and when they learn to exploit correlations between cues all remain poorly understood. We propose four experiments to address these questions. The first aim of this project is to investigate sensitivity to spectral cues. To address this issue, the first two experiments will examine speech perception when the natural covariance between two cues is violated or maintained. The latter two experiments will test sensitivity to changes in individual cues. The second aim is to assess relative cue salience across the lifespan. Results from the first experiment will be compared to existing data from normal-hearing and hearing-impaired elderly adult listeners who completed a similar task (Alexander & Kluender, in press; in preparation) to assess differential effects of listening experience and hearing health on perception of the same speech stimuli.

"A Direct Brain to Speech Generator for use in Humans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): LONG TERM OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS: We aim to restore near conversational rate speech in locked-in individuals. In the Phase 1 study, neural recordings from the speech motor area in a 23 year old locked-in subject implanted with the Neurotrophic Electrode System since December 2004 have yielded neural data that have been mapped to phonemic representations and to imagined and actual movements. In the proposed work, we intend to incorporate sophisticated speech recognition algortithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Hidden Markov Models, in order to enable rapid pattern recognition for purposes of a real-time Speech Prosthetic development. In addition, Population Vector Analysis as performed for chronic motor studies may realize a method of converting individual neuronal firings into Phonemic or Articulatory Space for driving a Speech Synthesis Model. An additional patient will be implanted with the electrode system to expand and verify the work achieved with the initial subject. The resulting data will add much to understanding the cortical organization of speech production and accelerate the development of a speech prosthetic for locked-in individuals. The website development for data sharing purposes will be expanded and used by the collaborators and other interested parties.       RELEVANCE OF RESEARCH TO PUBLIC HEALTH: The creation of a Speech Prosthetic Device is much needed by locked-in patients suffering from ALS and brain stem stroke. The substantial research being performed in invasive neuroprosthetic studies is focused on enabling recovery of lost motor functions in paralyzed limbs or providing indirect communication through computer software. This work is helpful to locked-in patients; however, such patients have indicated that real-time spontaneous speech is a much more desirable final application. The purpose of this research is to develop a speech prosthetic device using the Neurotrophic Electrode Human Cortical Recording system with sophisticated pattern recognition models and software. The majority of neuroprosthetic studies are focused on enabling recovery of lost motor functions in paralyzed limbs or providing indirect communication through computer software, however we believe that real-time spontaneous speech would be much more desirable application to locked-in patients.          n/a",A Direct Brain to Speech Generator for use in Humans,7905400,R44DC007050,"['Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain Stem Infarctions', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feeds', 'Frequencies', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Speech', 'Speech Synthesizers', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'data acquisition', 'data sharing', 'design', 'detector', 'implantation', 'improved', 'interest', 'male', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'motor control', 'relating to nervous system', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'vector', 'web site']",NIDCD,"NEURAL SIGNALS, INC.",R44,2009,74630,0.3025734512604956

"An Accessible, Effective Treatment for Sentence Deficit in Agrammatic Aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of our work is to develop an accessible, effective and cost effective speech and language treatment for aphasia. To achieve this goal, we will develop a commercial prototype of a computer program called Sentactics based on over 15 years of research at Northwestern University that demonstrates the effectiveness of the program to improve speech production and comprehension skills of individuals with aphasia. Preliminary work funded by the NIH resulted in an initial version of the Sentactics program. A clinical trial revealed that individuals with agrammatic aphasia who used Sentactics improved their speech and language production and comprehension skills significantly, with gains equivalent to subjects who were administered the clinical treatment from expert human clinicians. This study also demonstrated that individuals with aphasia find the Sentactics program to be highly engaging and fun to use. Our project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a commercial prototype of an improved version of Sentactics that incorporates two new features: (a) a spoken language system that uses speech and natural language processing technologies to provide feedback to clients about the accuracy of their speech productions, and (b) a clinician oversight capability that enables individual clinicians to use the internet to monitor multiple simultaneous users of the program and communicate with individual users as needed. In Phase I of the project, we will demonstrate the feasibility of using the spoken language system to provide feedback to clients about the accuracy of their speech productions. In Phase II we will develop a commercial prototype of the program incorporating the spoken language system and clinician oversight functions. We will then field test the program with individuals with aphasia. We will compare changes in the speech production and comprehension abilities of individuals using the Sentactics program to individuals using a commercially available program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful outcomes of this project would result in a commercial prototype of an accessible, affordable, effective and easy to use speech and language therapy program for use by individuals with aphasia in clinics or homes.

"Neuromotor Modeling of Adductor Spasmodic Dysphonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to create a laryngeal neuromotor model of adductor spasmodic dysphonia (SD), a chronic and often debilitating vocal disorder. We will achieve this goal by identifying specific motoneuron firing patterns that occur during vocal spasm by applying recently-developed multidimensional electromyographic technologies to laryngeal muscles. A neuromotor model of SD will serve to characterize the disorder at the motor nucleus. Neuromotor models, in turn, facilitate parallel research in fields of neuroimaging and drug treatment. Speech requires the coordinated control of multiple muscles by the central nervous system, from diaphragm to lips - with larynx playing a principal role in the phonatory process. Skeletal muscles are controlled by two mechanisms: the recruitment of motoneurons and modulation of motoneuron firing rates. Characterization of laryngeal muscle control at the level of the motoneuron is important toward our understanding of normal speech motor control and of neurologic speech motor disorders. Although studied for many decades, the cause of spasmodic dysphonia has remained elusive. Findings of neuroimaging, genetics, and physiology - including conventional electromyography - have been inconsistent and therefore inconclusive about the neural underpinnings of SD. Irrespective of the heterogeneity of findings using conventional modalities, the central participant in SD is the vocal spasm, and therefore we turn the fine lens offered by the imaging of multiple motoneuron firing activities upon these spasms. We hypothesize that vocal spasms are characterized by episodic increases in new motoneuron firing activity and that these new activities are disordered in firing rate characteristics with the existing pool and among themselves. We will test this hypothesis by obtaining motoneuron firing plots of an intralaryngeal muscle: thyroarytenoid. Motoneuron firing plots contain firing activities of multiple motoneurons simultaneously and in their correct temporal relations. Features of recruitment, correlation, synchronicity, and oscillation during vocal spasm will be compared to periods of non-spasm and to control features of a normal control population. Neuromuscular disorders that disrupt speech affect a sizeable population and often seriously impair the professional, social and family interactions of the affected individual. In applying recent advances in multi-dimensional physiologic and artificial intelligence technologies, this project will formulate models of vocal motor control at the level of the brainstem that improve our understanding of speech production in the normal population and of a voice disorder called spasmodic dysphonia. Knowledge gained from this research aims to assist the development of drug therapy to treat spasmodic dysphonia and other neuromuscular speech disorders.           n/a",Neuromotor Modeling of Adductor Spasmodic Dysphonia,7387178,R21DC008786,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electromyography', 'Family', 'Fire - disasters', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Lip structure', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Muscle', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thyroarytenoid Muscle', 'Voice Disorders', 'improved', 'lens', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'social']",NIDCD,NEW YORK MEDICAL COLLEGE,R21,2008,247971,0.15734022568864398
"Sensitivity to spectral cues in infant speech perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine infants' sensitivity to multiple spectral cues in speech perception. Speech is a complex signal, with numerous acoustic cues for every consonant and vowel. Through experience, listeners learn to exploit correlations between multiple cues, making perception more efficient and robust. Adults display this knowledge through their use of cues that are spectrally local (e.g. formant transitions) as well as distributed (e.g. gross spectral shape, or tilt) to distinguish speech sounds. Although prior research has demonstrated infants' ability to distinguish many speech sounds, how they distinguish these sounds is unclear. Infants' sensitivity to individual cues, the relative importance they assign to each cue, and when they learn to exploit correlations between cues all remain poorly understood. We propose four experiments to address these questions. The first aim of this project is to investigate sensitivity to spectral cues. To address this issue, the first two experiments will examine speech perception when the natural covariance between two cues is violated or maintained. The latter two experiments will test sensitivity to changes in individual cues. The second aim is to assess relative cue salience across the lifespan. Results from the first experiment will be compared to existing data from normal-hearing and hearing-impaired elderly adult listeners who completed a similar task (Alexander & Kluender, in press; in preparation) to assess differential effects of listening experience and hearing health on perception of the same speech stimuli. We hypothesize that both 6-to-7-month-old and 11-to-12-month-old-infants will exhibit perceptual sensitivity to both spectral cues in speech perception, with 11-to-12-month-olds displaying the greatest sensitivity. We also hypothesize that younger infants may be relatively more influenced by spectrally global (e.g. tilt) cues than older infants. Our long-term objective is to better understand development of speech perception in infants with normal and compromised hearing. These results will help refine treatment methods for infants with hearing loss, and inform the use of devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants. Public health statement: The proposed research will reveal the acoustic information infants use to distinguish speech sounds, and whether this information is used differently by adults. Knowing what infants listen for will benefit efforts to facilitate development of speech perception in children with compromised hearing. This research will also investigate when infants learn to exploit statistical regularities between cues in natural speech.             n/a",Sensitivity to spectral cues in infant speech perception,7546798,F31DC009532,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Complex', 'Condition', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Voice', 'Weight', 'base', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'infancy', 'research study', 'response', 'sound']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2008,27212,0.18163628511956356
"Development of Speech Perception and Brain Plasticity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Language is a hallmark of human beings. In the last 50 years, debates on language have given way to a new view of the process by which humans acquire language. One catalyst for theoretical change has been empirical studies on infants. In the last decade, researchers have not only charted when infants acquire knowledge about the properties of their native language, but how they do so, and this has caused a revision in linguistic and psychological theories. New research focuses on the phonetic units of speech, the consonants and vowels that form building blocks for words. Key advances from this laboratory are cross- language data showing that infants learn from exposure to language in the earliest periods of development and that this alters speech perception to assist language learning. Moreover, our studies show that early speech predicts later language, and that the clarity of mothers' infant-directed speech is linked to infants' speech perception abilities. Finally, brain measures on infants and adults listening to language suggest that, during early development, the infant brain ""neurally commits"" to the patterns of native language speech and that this both promotes future language learning as well as the decline in nonnative speech perception that occurs at the end of the first year of life. This work on early speech perception is impacting child development, neuroscience, neurobiology, and computational modeling. The early speech measures developed as a part of this project are being used in the study of developmental disabilities including autism, and may provide an early marker of the disability. The data prompted an extension of the Native Language Magnet model to incorporate neural commitment as the mechanism for developmental change. This theoretical position provides the background and framework for the studies in this proposal. Four converging lines of research are proposed to test the theory and further advance our knowledge of infant speech development: (a) speech perception development and its impact on language; (b) the brain correlates of early speech and language development, (c) the role of language input to children, and (d) brain plasticity and the ""critical period"" for language acquisition. The research will produce data that address theories of speech and language development and more general theories of the interface between biology and culture.           n/a",Development of Speech Perception and Brain Plasticity,7386008,R01HD037954,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Appendix', 'Audiotape', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Commit', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Other Finding', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phonetics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Theory', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Speech Development', 'Speech Perception', 'Techniques', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'catalyst', 'critical developmental period', 'disability', 'foreign language', 'infancy', 'language processing', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2008,539966,0.12841245110093377
"A Direct Brain to Speech Generator for use in Humans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): LONG TERM OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS: We aim to restore near conversational rate speech in locked-in individuals. In the Phase 1 study, neural recordings from the speech motor area in a 23 year old locked-in subject implanted with the Neurotrophic Electrode System since December 2004 have yielded neural data that have been mapped to phonemic representations and to imagined and actual movements. In the proposed work, we intend to incorporate sophisticated speech recognition algortithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Hidden Markov Models, in order to enable rapid pattern recognition for purposes of a real-time Speech Prosthetic development. In addition, Population Vector Analysis as performed for chronic motor studies may realize a method of converting individual neuronal firings into Phonemic or Articulatory Space for driving a Speech Synthesis Model. An additional patient will be implanted with the electrode system to expand and verify the work achieved with the initial subject. The resulting data will add much to understanding the cortical organization of speech production and accelerate the development of a speech prosthetic for locked-in individuals. The website development for data sharing purposes will be expanded and used by the collaborators and other interested parties.       RELEVANCE OF RESEARCH TO PUBLIC HEALTH: The creation of a Speech Prosthetic Device is much needed by locked-in patients suffering from ALS and brain stem stroke.

"Intonation in spontaneous English & Japanese dialogue    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spoken dialogue is 1 of the most basic forms of human language, ubiquitous across cultures. It differs in form from written language and read speech, with different vocabulary usage, different syntax, and an expanded use of visually available context. Most importantly, speakers and hearers of dialogue must rely on intonation, or the 'melody in speech.' When we talk, we manipulate the pitch, rate, phrasing, and volume of our speech. Patterns of intonation across a conversation can indicate complex discourse information not available from the words alone, such as what is already known by both speakers, what is newly introduced to 1 or both of them, which information they are finished discussing and what is still to be talked about. Although intonational structuring of discourse information is reported for numerous languages, a theory of the general cognitive mechanism underlying the universal use of intonation has yet to be established. The cross-linguistic research proposed here is crucial for the development of a general theory of intonation use in human language processing. The focus on analyses of unscripted conversational speech provides the most accurate information available about basic human language performance. Studying spontaneous speech has been considered an intractable problem, because it is hard to predict the specific words and sentence structures a speaker will use. We have piloted novel methodology that allows collection of multiple tokens of like utterances from the same speaker in varying intonational conditions. To understand how listeners respond in conversation, we use head-mounted eye-movement monitoring, an immediate, implicit measure of comprehension that allows the listener to speak and move while looking at the objects described by a conversational partner. The comparisons of English and Japanese, 2 languages that differ substantially in their syntax and intonation, test whether intonation is used differently in a language that provides melodic cues more or less reliably, and in different physical forms. Understanding how consistently intonation marks the information status of words and whether intonational cues facilitate listeners' comprehension of messages is important, not only for theories of language processing and development, but also for accurate speech identification and generation systems in artificial intelligence, and for the development of effective diagnoses and therapies for aphasic patients and others with communication loss.          n/a",Intonation in spontaneous English & Japanese dialogue,7253196,R01DC007090,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Eye Movements', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Instruction', 'Japanese Population', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phonetics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Rate', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Vocabulary', 'Writing', 'aphasic', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'efficacy research', 'improved', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'phonology', 'programs', 'research study', 'speech accuracy', 'syntax', 'theories', 'transmission process']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,216654,0.14150772928331604

"Articulatory recovery from speech acoustics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's goal is to build methods and algorithms for the recovery of articulatory movement from acoustic speech signals. In the immediate future this will be accomplished by employing analysis-by-techniques for sonorant sounds of English, but with a view to extend this to obstruents and the speech of other languages. There are four main areas of research that will be conducted to reach these goals. The first area is to study the relationship between small changes in articulation and the resulting acoustics, which is feasible now that a large amount of simultaneously recorded articulatory movement and acoustic data are available. The second area of research is in the kinematics of articulatory movement, particularly that of the tongue. Flesh point data enables a data-driven approach to the modeling of tongue kinematics. A quantitative approach to the kinematics of line segments between flesh points, secant lines, is being pursued because it is a first approximation to a kinematics of tongue shape, which is more closely related to acoustics than the flesh points themselves. Because the method for articulatory recovery is analysis-by-synthesis, it is necessary to have an articulatory synthesizer for an internal speech production model. The third area of research is the construction of an articulatory synthesizer that includes knowledge gained from the second area of research. With progress already made in articulatory synthesis, it is possible to concentrate on the kinematic control of the synthesizer. This also will be done from a data-driven approach with piecewise polynomials fit to secant line kinematic trajectories derived from flesh point data. Finally, the fourth area of research is in the recovery algorithms themselves, which include methods for normalization between different vocal tracts and the articulatory synthesizer's vocal tract. Both veridical (actual space-time articulatory trajectories are reproduced) and non-veridical (categorical segmental properties are reproduced for perceptually accurate identification) articulatory will be tested. Veridical articulatory recovery from speech acoustics is useful for the laboratory and clinic when acoustic and partial articulatory information are available and the scientist or clinician wants to know more about articulation. Non-veridical articulatory recovery is important for models of speech and language learning.         n/a",Articulatory recovery from speech acoustics,7046438,R01DC001247,"['X ray', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program /software', 'human data', 'mathematical model', 'speech', 'speech recognition', 'speech synthesizers']",NIDCD,"CRESS, LLC",R01,2006,198938,0.15499517416918993
"Diagnostic Markers for Childhood Apraxia Speech DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood Apraxia of Speech is a highly controversial disorder due to a lack of consensus on the features that define it and the etiologic conditions that explain its origin. The term Suspected Apraxia of Speech (sAOS) has been proposed as an interim term for this putative clinical entity. The point prevalence of sAOS in young children has been estimated at approximately 0.1%. The long-term objective of this proposal is to develop a valid, reliable, and efficient means to classify children as positive for sAOS. In addition to the contributions to theoretical explication of AOS, the software-based diagnostic tools resulting from this work will allow any certified speech-language pathologist to determine if a child's speech includes prosodic features that fall within a 95% confidence interval supporting the diagnosis of sAOS. The aim for this first period of planned programmatic research is to develop automated diagnostic markers for sAOS with clinically adequate sensitivity and specificity (> 90% positive and negative likelihood ratios).  The four specific aims are: (a) to automate and improve the sensitivity and specificity of two existing (manually derived) prosodic markers, (b) to develop four additional automatic, prosody-based diagnostic markers, (c) to derive a single diagnostic index based on a statistical derivative from the six individual markers, and (d) to validate the composite diagnostic marker using classification data obtained from expert clinical researchers.  Procedures are divided into four phases. In Year 1, automated versions of existing markers will be developed that determine speech-event locations using automatic speech recognition (ASR). Based on two pilot studies, this technique is expected to yield results equivalent to published data. The sensitivity of the markers will be improved by methods including normalizing by speaking rate and vowel identity. In Year 2, new automated markers will be created based on ASR and speech-signal processing techniques. These markers will measure variation in interstress timing, linguistic rhythm, speaking rate, and glottal-source characteristics. In the first part of Year 3, results from all six markers will be combined into a single diagnostic index using multi-layer perceptrons. In the latter part of Year 3, per-child errors will be evaluated to determine relationships between specific prosodic factors and the diagnosis of sAOS, providing insight into the features and definition of sAOS. n/a",Diagnostic Markers for Childhood Apraxia Speech,7035268,R21DC006722,"['apraxias', 'artificial intelligence', 'biomarker', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human data', 'speech disorder diagnosis', 'speech disorders', 'speech recognition']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2006,159900,0.16859613637089166

Understanding how consistently intonation marks the information status of words and whether intonational cues facilitate listeners' comprehension of messages is important, not only for theories of language processing and development, but also for accurate speech identification and generation systems in artificial intelligence, and for the development of effective diagnoses and therapies for aphasic patients and others with communication loss.          n/a",Intonation in spontaneous English & Japanese dialogue,7144725,R01DC007090,"['clinical research', 'comprehension', 'language', 'speech']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,223125,0.14150772928331604
"Diagnostic Markers for Childhood Apraxia Speech DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood Apraxia of Speech is a highly controversial disorder due to a lack of consensus on the features that define it and the etiologic conditions that explain its origin. The term Suspected Apraxia of Speech (sAOS) has been proposed as an interim term for this putative clinical entity. The point prevalence of sAOS in young children has been estimated at approximately 0.1%. The long-term objective of this proposal is to develop a valid, reliable, and efficient means to classify children as positive for sAOS. In addition to the contributions to theoretical explication of AOS, the software-based diagnostic tools resulting from this work will allow any certified speech-language pathologist to determine if a child's speech includes prosodic features that fall within a 95% confidence interval supporting the diagnosis of sAOS. The aim for this first period of planned programmatic research is to develop automated diagnostic markers for sAOS with clinically adequate sensitivity and specificity (> 90% positive and negative likelihood ratios).  The four specific aims are: (a) to automate and improve the sensitivity and specificity of two existing (manually derived) prosodic markers, (b) to develop four additional automatic, prosody-based diagnostic markers, (c) to derive a single diagnostic index based on a statistical derivative from the six individual markers, and (d) to validate the composite diagnostic marker using classification data obtained from expert clinical researchers.  Procedures are divided into four phases. In Year 1, automated versions of existing markers will be developed that determine speech-event locations using automatic speech recognition (ASR). Based on two pilot studies, this technique is expected to yield results equivalent to published data. The sensitivity of the markers will be improved by methods including normalizing by speaking rate and vowel identity. In Year 2, new automated markers will be created based on ASR and speech-signal processing techniques. These markers will measure variation in interstress timing, linguistic rhythm, speaking rate, and glottal-source characteristics. In the first part of Year 3, results from all six markers will be combined into a single diagnostic index using multi-layer perceptrons. In the latter part of Year 3, per-child errors will be evaluated to determine relationships between specific prosodic factors and the diagnosis of sAOS, providing insight into the features and definition of sAOS. n/a",Diagnostic Markers for Childhood Apraxia Speech,6881272,R21DC006722,"['apraxias', 'artificial intelligence', 'biomarker', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human data', 'speech disorder diagnosis', 'speech disorders', 'speech recognition']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,164000,0.16859613637089166
"INTELLIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT IN DYSARTHRIA   DESCRIPTION: Dysarthria is a frequent result of several neurological disorders,      including Parkinson disease, stroke, cerebellar pathologies, multiple                sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. Dysarthrias often lead to decreased           speech intelligibility, but they also affect other dimensions of spoken              language, including voice quality, prosody, and paralinguistic features. These       have not been studied collectively in large numbers of individuals with              dysarthria. This project uses a multiple-task protocol with both perceptual and      acoustic measures to examine intelligibility, voice quality, prosody, and            paralinguistic aspects in children and adults with acquired dysarthria. Several      newly developed analyses will be used to provide quantitative data toward the        construction of profiles of speech impairment and neurologic lesion. Included        will be the first systematic replication of the original work that led to the        contemporary classification of the dysarthrias. The data on dysarthria will be       integrated with data on speech development and normal adult speech in a neural       network model of speech production that is based on internal models of auditory      and articulatory representations of speech.                                                                                                                               n/a",INTELLIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT IN DYSARTHRIA,6833535,R01DC000319,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'adult human (21+)', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'cerebellar disorders', 'cerebral palsy', 'child (0-11)', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder classification', 'dysarthria', 'human subject', 'multiple sclerosis', 'nervous system disorder diagnosis', 'neural information processing', 'perception', 'speech', 'speech disorder diagnosis', 'stroke', 'vocabulary', 'voice']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2005,437328,0.3024955534208523

"Virtual Therapist Speech Treatment for Parkinson Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our previous studies have generated the first short- and long-term experimental efficacy data for speech treatment for individuals with Idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD), documenting acoustic, aerodynamic and physiologic changes accompanying treatment. Despite these major steps in establishing the experimental efficacy of speech treatment for individuals with IPD, the ""real world"" treatment of speech remains an unmet need for the vast majority of these individuals. At least 89% of individuals with IPD have disordered speech, but only 3-4% receive speech treatment. This is a serious problem, as individuals with IPD who have received Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) therapy benefit in many ways: they not only produce more intelligible and expressive speech, but they often report dramatic improvements in their self esteem and quality of life. We thus propose to conduct research to demonstrate the feasibility 6f a novel solution to make LSVT training more accessible to over one million individuals--the development and testing of a fully automated computer-based speech therapy system, in which voice training is conducted by a virtual speech therapist--and animated computer character that models the key perception and production behaviors of a human therapist. While development of the proposed system may seem futuristic and ambitious at first blush, perceptive animated agents are now a reality, and language training applications using these agents have produced significant gains in speech and language skills of profoundly deaf children. In addition, under a seed grant from the Coleman Foundation, we have developed an initial version of an LSVT therapist that models well the facial expressions, gestures and utterances of a human LSVT therapist. It is thus feasible to develop and assess the potential value of an automated training system that uses a perceptive animated agent to conduct voice training with individuals with IPD. The proposed work builds upon our well established foundation of experimental efficacy data and the successful application of perceptive animated agents in language training tasks to accomplish two specific aims: (1) design and test a fully automated voice training system in which a virtual therapist conducts LSVT sessions with individuals with IPD; and (2) explore the feasibility of using this system as either a substitute or adjunct to LSVT training with human clinicians. In addition to assessment procedures used in previous LSVT efficacy studies, the proposed work will provide new insights into LSVT treatment through sophisticated analyses of audio and video data collected during sessions and pre and post treatment, that employ computer vision and speech signal processing algorithms to analysis of facial movements, gestures and speech data.         n/a",Virtual Therapist Speech Treatment for Parkinson Disease,6885764,R21DC006078,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'behavior test', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'comorbidity', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'educational resource design /development', 'face expression', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'interactive multimedia', 'language development', 'paralinguistic behavior', 'patient oriented research', 'speech disorders', 'speech therapy', 'training aid', 'verbal behavior', 'verbal learning', 'voice']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER,R21,2005,205957,0.2353506124968331

"Production modeling for articulatory recovery The speech production model developed in this work will serve as an internal model in an analysis-by-synthesis algorithm intended to recover articulatory movement from speech acoustics. The speech production model will have three components: 1) an improved version of the Haskins articulatory synthesizer, ASY, 2) an improved task-dynamic model, and 3) an inverse normalizing map, which relates ASY vocal tract shapes to human vocal tract shapes.  In order for ASY and the task-dynamic model to serve as components of a model of a human talker it is necessary that the task-dynamic, with end effectors in ASY, induce the articulatory kinematics observed in the talker as the image of the inverse normalizing map.

ASY and the task-dynamic model are parts of a veridical model of human speech production only in conjunction with an inverse normalizing map.  The approach here will be to make ASY and the task-dynamic model as realistic as possible without compromising their relative simplicity.  This will enable inverse normalizing maps to be mathematically regular functions, which is an important property for articulatory recovery. There have been many empirical studies on vocal tract shape performed since the time ASY was constructed that can be included into ASY.  Improvements in the transfer function calculation can also be made at this time.  With improvements to ASY will necessarily come improvements in the task-dynamic model, particularly tongue control and control during obstruent production.  Various methods for constructing the inverse normalizing map, along with its ability to map articulatory kinematics, will also be tested.  With all three components, the task-dynamic model will be tested using X-ray microbeam data of human speech production.  n/a",Production modeling for articulatory recovery,6370912,R01DC001247,"['X ray', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' human data', ' mathematical model', ' speech', ' speech recognition', ' speech synthesizers']",NIDCD,"CRESS, LLC",R01,2001,137046,0.14075823146810523
"INTELLIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT IN DYSARTHRIA   DESCRIPTION: Dysarthria is a frequent result of several neurological disorders,      including Parkinson disease, stroke, cerebellar pathologies, multiple                sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. Dysarthrias often lead to decreased           speech intelligibility, but they also affect other dimensions of spoken              language, including voice quality, prosody, and paralinguistic features. These       have not been studied collectively in large numbers of individuals with              dysarthria. This project uses a multiple-task protocol with both perceptual and      acoustic measures to examine intelligibility, voice quality, prosody, and            paralinguistic aspects in children and adults with acquired dysarthria. Several      newly developed analyses will be used to provide quantitative data toward the        construction of profiles of speech impairment and neurologic lesion. Included        will be the first systematic replication of the original work that led to the        contemporary classification of the dysarthrias. The data on dysarthria will be       integrated with data on speech development and normal adult speech in a neural       network model of speech production that is based on internal models of auditory      and articulatory representations of speech.                                                                                                                               n/a",INTELLIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT IN DYSARTHRIA,6286948,R01DC000319,"[""Parkinson's disease"", ' adult human (21+)', ' amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' cerebellar disorders', ' cerebral palsy', ' child (0-11)', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder classification', ' dysarthria', ' human subject', ' multiple sclerosis', ' nervous system disorder diagnosis', ' neural information processing', ' perception', ' speech', ' speech disorder diagnosis', ' stroke', ' vocabulary', ' voice']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2001,407733,0.3024955534208523
"NEURAL NETWORK MODELING OF SPEECH PRODUCTION The long-term objectives of the proposed research are to elucidate the           stages of speaking skill development in infants and the motor control            mechanisms for speech production in adults.  These research areas are            important for early diagnosis and proper treatment of speech disorders.          The proposed research consists primarily of the development, refinement,         and experimental testing of a comprehensive neural network modeling              framework for speech production based on preliminary work described in           Guenther (Appendices A).  Model additions will include an articulatory           mechanism that allows synthesis of speech wave-forms and an acoustic-like        coordinate frame for speech movement planning.  Proposed research also           includes the development of software for producing speaker-specific vocal        tract models based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans.  These models      will allow synthesis of speech signals that account for the differences in       vocal tract sizes and shapes of different individuals, thus providing a          more accurate means for investigating the acoustic/articulatory                  relationships of individuals acting as subjects in speech production             experiments.  An experimental investigation utilizing these speaker-             specific vocal tract models is also proposed to test an hypothesis               generated by the modeling framework.  Some speakers use two entirely             different articulator configurations, called ""bunched"" and retroflex"", to        produce /r/ in different contexts.  The proposed model predicts that the         same target is specified tot he production mechanism in the two cases, but       that different articulator configurations arise in different contexts due        to two properties of the speech production mechanism: (1) movement planning      in an acoustic-like coordinate frame, and (2) transformation of the planned      acoustic trajectories into articulator movements via a direction-to-             direction mapping.  Speaker-specific vocal tract models corresponding to         two subjects will be incorporated into the proposed modeling framework,          which will then be used to predict which configuration each subject will         use to produce /r/ in each of four contexts.  The hypothesis will be tested      by comparing model performance with the performance of the subjects while        producing /r/ in the same four contests, as measured in an Electro-Magnetic      Midsagittal Articulometer (EMMA) study.  Finally, the proposed modeling          framework will be used to investigate several other issues in speech             production, including two modeling studies of speech motor development in        infants (made possible by the self-organizing nature of the proposed             model), and an investigation of intrinsic timing issues.                             GRANT=R01DE09161                                                             The ability to utilize hemin and hemin containing compounds as an iron           source has been documented for several pathogenic bacteria, including the        periodontopathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis.  We have previously                determined that P. gingivalis transports the entire hemin moiety into the        cell by an energy-dependent mechanism and that the binding and accumulation      of hemin are induced by growth of cultures in the presence of hemin.             However, the specific P. gingivalis components involved in hemin binding         and transport have not been identified.  Growth of P. gingivalis under           hemin-replete conditions has also been shown to influence the expression of      several virulence factors; however, the role of hemin in the regulation of       specific virulence genes has not been precisely defined.                                                                                                          The primary objectives of the present application are to define the              molecular mechanisms involved in hemin binding and transport in P.               gingivalis and to examine the regulation of hemin responsive genes.  Four        specific aims are proposed:                                                                                                                                       1.  To identify and characterize athe P. gingivalis hemin receptor(s).  P.       gingivalis outer membrane proteins involved in hemin binding will be             identified by hemin affinity chromatography.  The specificity of the             putative receptor(s) will be defined by examining the binding of 14[C]hemin      to P. gingivalis in the presence of hemin and nonahemin iron sources.                                                                                             2.  To clone P. gingivalis genes encoding proteins involved in hemin             binding and transport.  P. gingivalis genes encoding hemin binding proteins      will be cloned by screening E. coli recombinants for the ability to bind         hemin.  P. gingivalis genes encoding proteins involved in hemin transport        will be cloned by screening E. coli hemA mutants for the ability to grow         with hemin.  Corresponding P. gingivalis mutants will be obtained by             insertional inactivation of the cloned genes and characterized both in           vitro and in vivo.                                                                                                                                                3.  To elucidate the regulation of hemin binding and transport genes.  The       regulation of cloned P. gingivalis genes involved in hemin binding and           transport will be examined by analysis of mRNA and transcriptional fusions       under hemin-deplete and -replete conditions.                                                                                                                      4.  To identify P. gingivalis genes that are regulated by the ferric uptake      regulator (Fur).  Our preliminary results indicate that the expression of        hemin/iron-responsive genes in P. gingivalis may be controlled by the            negative ferric uptake regulator protein, Fur.  We will begin to identify        P. gingivalis genes that are regulated by Fur by screening a P. gingivalis       genomic library using the Fur titration asssay.                                                                                                                   The results obtained in these studies will allow us to identify specific         components of the hemin transport system in P. gingivalis and will provide       important information on the regulation of hemin responsive genes.                n/a",NEURAL NETWORK MODELING OF SPEECH PRODUCTION,6150504,R29DC002852,"['artificial intelligence', ' auditory feedback', ' auditory stimulus', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' human subject', ' language development', ' model design /development', ' psychoacoustics', ' sound', ' speech', ' speech recognition', ' vocal cords', ' vocalization']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R29,2000,114255,0.12354598864299535
"Decoding inner speech: An AI approach to transcribing thoughts via EEG & EMG ABSTRACT  Losing the capacity to communicate through language has a significant negative impact on a personâs autonomy, social interactions, occupation, mental health, and overall quality of life. Many people lose the capacity to speak and write but keep their thinking intact.  Inner speech is internally and willfully generated, non-articulated verbal thoughts (e.g., reading in silence). Changes in the activation patterns of the brainâs language-related areas co-occur with inner speech and can be detected with electroencephalography (EEG). Furthermore, while inner speech doesnât lead to any discernible voice sound or articulation, co-occurring low amplitude electrical discharges in the articulatory muscles can be detected with electromyography (EMG). The information about ongoing inner speech reflected in electrophysiological signals (EEG and EMG) can be used to transcribe inner speech into text or voice.  Machine learning algorithms have been used for this purpose, however, the resulting systems have low accuracy and/or are constrained by very small vocabularies (~10 words). Furthermore, these systems need to be trained anew for each user, which significantly increases individual data-collection time. The development of ready-to-use/minimal-training (fine tuning) systems requires large training datasets that algorithms can use to learn high-level features capable of being transferred between individuals. Unfortunately, to date there are no available datasets that are large enough to train these systems.  To tackle these issues, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team of collaborators from Google AI, Yale linguistics, and Yale Psychiatry to develop a state-of-the-art deep neural network to transcribe inner speech to text using EEG and EMG signals. This system will incorporate some of the latest advances in artificial intelligence and data processing developed by Google AI. It will be designed to transcribe phonemes, thus, in principle, will be able to transcribe any word. Furthermore, we will collect the largest (x120 times) multi-subject (n=150) electrophysiological (EEG+EMG) inner speech dataset to date (300 hrs. in total) to train the first ready- to-use/minimal-training inner speech transcriber system.  The technology resulting from this study has the potential to radically improve the quality of life of thousands of patients by providing them with a fast method of communicating their verbal thoughts. Furthermore, by combining this system with one of the many text-to-speech AIs that are currently available, our system could potentially restore the patientsâ capacity to produce conversational speech. PROJECT NARRATIVE People that have lost their capacity for verbal communication struggle with isolation, mental illness, and poor quality of life. Artificial intelligence offers an opportunity to translate verbal thoughts into text or synthesized voice and restore verbal communication in impaired people. In this study, we introduce a state-of-the art artificial intelligence system designed to transduce the electrophysiological activity (electroencephalography [EEG] and electromyography [EMG]) accompanying verbal thoughts into text.",Decoding inner speech: An AI approach to transcribing thoughts via EEG & EMG,10058047,R21EB029607,"['ALS2 gene', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Expert Systems', 'Fostering', 'Gender', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'Writing', 'algorithm training', 'blind', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'performance tests', 'sound', 'speech accuracy']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,523600,0.21892894825368975
"Speech segregation to improve intelligility of reverberant-noisy speech Project Summary Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions, affecting 37.5 million Americans. Although signal amplification in modern hearing aids makes sound more audible to hearing impaired listeners, speech understanding in background interference remains the biggest challenge by hearing aid wearers. The proposed research seeks a monaural (one-microphone) solution to this challenge by developing supervised speech segregation based on deep learning. Unlike traditional speech enhancement, deep learning based speech segregation is driven by training data, and three components of a deep neural network (DNN) model are features, training targets, and network architectures. Recently, deep learning has achieved tremendous successes in a variety of real world applications. Our approach builds on the progress made in the PI's previous R01 project which demonstrated, for the first time, substantial speech intelligibility improvements for hearing-impaired listeners in noise. A main focus of the proposed work in this cycle is to combat room reverberation in addition to background interference. The proposed work is designed to achieve three specific aims. The first aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant-noisy speech for hearing- impaired listeners. To achieve this aim, we will train DNNs to perform time-frequency masking. The second aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant speech in the presence of competing speech. To achieve this aim, we will perform DNN training to estimate two ideal masks, one for the target talker and the other for the interfering talker. The third aim is to improve intelligibility of reverberant speech in combined speech and nonspeech interference. To achieve this aim, we will develop a two-stage DNN model where the first stage will be trained to remove nonspeech interference and the second stage to remove interfering speech. Eight speech intelligibility experiments involving both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners will be conducted to systematically evaluate the developed system. The proposed project is expected to substantially close the speech intelligibility gap between hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners in daily conditions, with the ultimate goal of removing the gap altogether. Relevance A widely acknowledged deficit of hearing loss is reduced intelligibility of reverberant-noisy speech. How to improve speech intelligibility of hearing impaired listeners in everyday environments is a major technical challenge. This project directly addresses this challenge and the results from the project are expected to yield technical methods that can be translated to hearing prosthesis, potentially benefiting millions of individuals with hearing loss.",Speech segregation to improve intelligility of reverberant-noisy speech,9831633,R01DC012048,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microphone', 'network architecture', 'normal hearing', 'real world application', 'segregation', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech in noise', 'success', 'supervised learning']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,303452,0.301781823836354
"CRCNS: Avian Model for Neural Activity Driven Speech Prostheses  Understanding the physical, computational, and theoretical bases of human vocal communication, speech, is crucial to improved comprehension of voice, speech and language diseases and disorders, and improving their diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Meeting this challenge requires knowledge of the neural and sensorimotor mechanisms of vocal motor control. Our project will directly investigate the neural and sensorimotor mechanisms involved in the production of complex, natural, vocal communication signals. Our results will directly enhance brain-computer interface technology for communication and will accelerate the development of prostheses and other assistive technologies for individuals with communications deficits due to injury or disease. We will develop a vocal prosthetic that directly translates neural signals in cortical sensorimotor and vocal-motor control regions into vocal communication signals output in real-time. Building on success using non-human primates for brain computer interfaces for general motor control, the prosthetic will be developed in songbirds, whose acoustically rich, learned vocalizations share many features with human speech. Because the songbird vocal apparatus is functipnally and anatomically similar to the human larynx, and the cortical regions that control it are closely analogous to speech motor-control areas of the human brain, songbirds offer an ideal model for the proposed studies. Beyond the application of our work to human voice and speech, development of the vocal prosthetic will enable novel speech-relevant studies in the songbird model that can reveal fundamental mechanisms of vocal learning and production. In the first stage of the project, we collect a large data set of simultaneously recorded neural activity and vocalizations. In stage two, we will apply machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to develop algorithms that map neural recordings to vocal output and enable us to estimate intended vocalizations directly from neural data. In stage three, we will develop computing infrastructure to run these algorithms in real-time, predicting intended vocalizations from neural activity as the animal is actively producing these vocalizations. In stage four, we will test the effectiveness of the prosthetic by substituting the bird's own vocalization with the output from our prosthetic system. Success will set the stage for testing of these technologies in humans and translation to multiple assistive devices. In addition to our research goals, the project will engage graduate, undergraduate, and high school students through the development of novel educational modules that introduce students to brain machine interface and multidisciplinary studies that span engineering and the basic sciences. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Developing a vocal prosthesis will directly enhance brain-computer interface technology for communication and accelerate the realization of prostheses and other assistive technologies for individuals with communications deficits due to injury or disease. The basic knowledge of the neural and sensorimotor mechanisms of vocal motor control acquired will impact understanding of multiple voice, speech, and language diseases and disorders.

"Real-time deep learning to improve speech intelligibility in noise Project Summary/Abstract  One in eight Americans has hearing loss, and this constitutes a major health and economic burden (Blackwell et al., 2014). The primary complaint of hearing-impaired (HI) listeners is difficulty understanding speech when background noise is present (see Dillon, 2012). While hearing aids (HAs) have improved in recent years, they still provide little benefit in noisy environments. For decades, a means of improving the ability to understand speech in background noise appeared unattainable, despite substantial amounts of research by both universities and HA companies. This changed when deep learning provided the first demonstration of a single-microphone algorithm that improves intelligibly in noise for HI listeners (Healy et al., 2013, 2014, 2015). Although this algorithm provides massive intelligibility improvements (even allowing listeners to improve intelligibility from floor to ceiling levels), it is currently not implemented to operate in real time and is therefore not suitable for implementation into HAs and cochlear implants (CIs). What is needed, therefore, is a highly effective noise-reduction algorithm that is capable of operating in real time. This project aims to address this critical need.  The long-term goal of the currently proposed project is to alleviate HI listenersâ predominant hearing handicap, which is difficulty understanding speech in background noise. The first aim introduces a new algorithm, based on a novel foundational scheme, that is designed to provide substantial benefit for any HI listener in real time. This algorithm will be well suited for implementation into HAs, CIs, and other face-to-face communication applications. The effectiveness of this new algorithm will be quantified using both HI and normal-hearing (NH) listeners. The second aim expands upon this new algorithm by modifying it to accept a small amount of future time-frame information, which could improve its noise-reduction performance but will introduce a brief processing delay. The rationale is that different devices have different allowable latencies. Face-to-face communication devices (HAs, CIs, etc.) have strict low-latency requirements, but other important communication systems (e.g., telephones) have different requirements. It is possible that the addition of future time-frame information within these requirements (up to 150 ms) will result in even better speech intelligibility. But the magnitude of any potential benefit is unknown. This critical information will be established currently. Using both HI and NH listeners, we will measure intelligibility for noisy sentences that have been processed using various amounts of future time information.  This comprehensive fellowship training plan will provide individualized, mentored research training from world-class faculty in a highly supportive and productive environment. The proposed work will endow the applicant with the skills needed to transition to the next stage of his research career, transform our treatment of hearing loss, and substantially impact quality of life for millions of Americans. Project Narrative An estimated 37.5 million Americans have hearing loss, which commonly leads to difficulty understanding speech in background noise.

"Using the RDoC Approach to Understand Thought Disorder: A Linguistic Corpus-Based Approach Thought disorder in psychotic disorders and their risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. We propose instead to use a novel automated linguistic corpus-based approach to language analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language, and leads to measures of semantic coherence from one phrase to the next. It also evaluates syntactic complexity through âpart-of-speechâ tagging and analysis of speech graphs. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture thought disorder.  Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we identified a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort, which included decreased semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, and decreased syntactic complexity, including shortened phrase length and decreased use of determiner pronouns (âwhichâ, âwhatâ, âthatâ). These features correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. We further cross-validated this automated approach in a second small CHR cohort, identifying a semantics/syntax classifier that classified psychosis outcome in both cohorts, and discriminated speech in recent-onset psychosis patients from normal speech.  These automated linguistic analytic methods hold great promise, but their use thus far has been circumscribed to only a few small studies that aim to discriminate schizophrenia from the norm, and in our own work, predict psychosis. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the linguistic mechanisms that underlie thought disorder. To address this gap, in response to PAR-16-136, we propose to use the RDoC construct of language production, and its linguistic corpus-based analytic paradigm, to study thought disorder dimensionally and transdiagnostically, in a large cohort of 150 putatively healthy volunteers, 150 CHR patients, and 150 recent-onset psychosis patients. We expect that latent semantic analysis will yield measures of semantic coherence that index positive thought disorder (tangentiality, derailment), whereas part-of-speech (POS) tagging/speech graphs will yields measures of syntactic complexity that index negative thought disorder (concreteness, poverty of content).  This large language dataset will be obtained from two PSYSCAN/HARMONY sites, such that these language data will be available for secondary analyses with PSYSCAN/HARMONY imaging and EEG data to study language production at the circuit and physiological levels. This large language and clinical dataset will also be archived at NIH for further linguistic analyses by other investigators. Language offers a privileged view into the mind: it is the basis by which we infer others' thoughts. In collaboration with computer scientists at IBM, we will use advanced computational speech analytic approaches to identify the linguistic basis â semantics and syntax â that underlie language production along a spectrum from normal to gradations of thought disorder. Our large international language dataset on 450 individuals will be archived at NIH as a resource for further linguistic analyses.",Using the RDoC Approach to Understand Thought Disorder: A Linguistic Corpus-Based Approach,9859468,R01MH115332,"['Address', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Canis familiaris', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Felis catus', 'Genetic', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Length', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Poverty', 'Production', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Yogurt', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'natural language', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'syntax', 'vector']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,533776,0.15230284060761007
"Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events We experience the world as a continuous sequence of events, but we remember the events as segmented episodes (e.g., my sisterâs wedding). During encoding, we associate a sequence of relevant events and segment deviant events. At retrieval, episodic memory utilizes the encoded associations to replay the flow of events. The encoded associations lead to remembering the sequence of events that occurred within an episode better than the flow of events across segments. The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortices (PFC) are essential parts of the neural circuit for segmenting, linking, and retrieving memories of associated events. This proposal aims to identify neural dynamics in the hippocampus-PFC circuit that support encoding a naturalistic flow of events, i.e., sequences of words. We will determine these neural dynamics using intracranial encephalography (iEEG) acquired from the hippocampus and PFC of epileptic patients, who have electrodes implemented for pre-surgical seizure monitoring. I will model associations of words using Natural Language Processing algorithms, and I will combine the extracted features with advanced data analysis techniques including multivariate pattern analysis to determine neural dynamics engaged during encoding. I will use speech as a model with an identical flow of events in the speech stimuli across participants. This consistency will allow validation of effects across a group of participants. Algorithms for identifying features of speech are well developed and freely available. I will specifically use elements of speech that distinguish context, word dependencies, and reference points of pronouns for modeling concurrent changes in patterns of activity in the local field potential recorded from the hippocampus and PFC. The central hypotheses are that bidirectional communications between the hippocampus and PFC support the encoding of sequences of events and successful subsequent memory. To address a causal relationship between hippocampal function and event segmentation, I will study speech comprehension and speech memory in developmental amnesic patients who suffer from hippocampal damage and have trouble tracking reference points in a speech. To achieve the proposalâs goals, I will pursue training under the mentorship of Dr. Elizabeth Buffalo (University of Washington) that will focus on the advanced analysis of local field potentials. The advanced study of human iEEG data will include comparable electrophysiology signal analyses that have been applied to the recordings from the hippocampus of non-human primates in Buffaloâs memory lab. This skill-set along with ongoing mentoring from Dr. Robert Knight (University of California, Berkeley), who has an established laboratory for human iEEG, and my previous work on human iEEG will provide a vigorous methodological, conceptual, and analytical basis for developing an independent research program. The combination of iEEG, Natural Language Processing modeling, and patientsâ behavioral data will provide valuable insights into the neural dynamics of effective speech encoding that predicts subsequent memory, which may inform development into therapeutic interventions. The ability to segment the world into meaningful episodes engages the human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Using direct electrophysiological recording from the human brain, advanced analytical techniques, Natural Language Processing models, and the behavior of patients with hippocampal lesions, this proposal will determine the neural dynamics for efficient encoding of sequences of words that predicts successful memory formation. The findings of this proposal may help inform the development of neural prosthetics for assisting patients with memory deficits.",Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events,9894860,K99MH120048,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Buffaloes', 'California', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sister', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'deviant', 'encephalography', 'experience', 'indexing', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'nonhuman primate', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,96235,0.09329362980053299
"Prolonging Functional Speech in Persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Real-Time Virtual Vocal Tract People with ALS eventually and inevitably experience serious speech impairment due to progressive deterioration of brain cells that control movements of the tongue, lips and jaw. Despite the devastating consequences of this speech impairment on quality of life and survival, few options are available to assist impaired oral communication, and many existing speech-generating technologies are slow to operate and cost prohibitive. This project seeks to improve quality of life for persons with impaired speech due to ALS by testing the effectiveness of a low-cost, speech-generating device (a virtual vocal tract) that could significantly prolong the ability of these patients to communicate orally. If successful, these techniques could be extended for use by patients' with a broad range of speech motor impairments. The virtual vocal track uses machine learning algorithms to predict what a person is attempting to say, in real-time, based solely on lip movements. Users of the device are able to trigger the playback of a number of predetermined phrases by simply attempting to articulate what they want to say. Our previous work has shown the feasibility of this approach using cost-prohibitive laboratory systems such as electromagnetic articulography. Recent advances in 3D depth mapping camera technology allow these techniques to be tested for the first time using technologies, which are low-cost, portable and already being integrated into consumer devices such as laptops and cellphones. To this end, the system under development will be tested in 60 patients with ALS, representing a range of speech impairment from normal to severe speech intelligibility (15 normal, 15 mild, 15 moderate, 15 severe). During testing, participants will be cued to articulate the phrases in a random order as fast as is comfortable for them. The entire session will be recorded and the following variables will be measured offline: recognition accuracy, recognition latency, task time, % completion, and communication rate (words per minute). Users will rate the usability and acceptability of the virtual vocal tract immediately following device testing, using the System Usability Scale. Results of this testing will be used to address the following specific aims: (1) Determine the accuracy and latency of real-time phrase synthesis based on dysarthric speech using the virtual vocal tract, (2) Determine the usability and acceptability of real-time phrases produced using the virtual vocal tract, and (3) Identify the articulatory and speech factors that degrade recognition accuracy. People with ALS eventually and inevitably experience serious speech impairment due to progressive bulbar motor deterioration. Despite the devastating consequences of this impairment to quality of life, few options are available to assist or prolong impaired oral communication. The goal of the proposed work is to lay the groundwork for development of a low-cost speech-generating deviceâa virtual vocal tractâthat can prolong functional oral communication for people with bulbar motor deterioration. This project seeks to testing the efficacy of a low-cost, speech-generating device (a virtual vocal tract) that records lip movements in real-time and triggers the playback of prerecorded phrases as users articulate what they want to say. If successful, the virtual device could provide an alternative means of oral communication for the large number of persons with unintelligible speech but still able to move their oral structures.",Prolonging Functional Speech in Persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Real-Time Virtual Vocal Tract,9964782,K24DC016312,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Articulation', 'Articulators', 'Bypass', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dysarthria', 'Effectiveness', 'Electromagnetics', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Oral', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Sound', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'clear speech', 'cost', 'effectiveness testing', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'jaw movement', 'laptop', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'orofacial', 'phrases', 'portability', 'spatiotemporal', 'time use', 'usability', 'virtual', 'virtual vocal tract']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,K24,2020,189841,0.2799142069615122
"A holistic approach to identifying functional units of tongue motion during speech PROJECT SUMMARY  Oral cancers have the seventh highest incidence, with roughly 51,540 new cases and 10,030 cancer- related deaths expected to occur in 2018. Although a variety of treatment methods are available, the death rate is higher than that for most cancers with five-year rates of about 50 percent. The most frequently used treatment method, glossectomy surgery, involves the surgical removal of tumors and surrounding tissues, and the addition of grafted tissues, often followed by radiotherapy. Although tongue cancer and its treatment have debilitating effects on speech, the impact of varying degrees of resection and reconstruction on the formation of functional units in speech has remained poorly understood. In order to produce intelligible speech, a variety of local muscle groupings of the tongueâi.e., functional unitsâemerge and recede rapidly and nimbly in a highly coordinated fashion. Therefore, understanding the formation of functional units that are critical for speech production can provide substantial insights into normal, pathological, and adapted motor control strategies in controls and patients with tongue cancer for novel therapeutic, surgical, and rehabilitative strategies. One of the critical challenges in pre-operative surgical and treatment planning, as well as in post- operative evaluation for tongue cancer is the difficulty in developing objective and quantitative measures and in evaluating their functional outcome predictability. To address this, in this proposal, three integrated approaches will be used in in vivo tongue motion during speech to seamlessly identify the functional units and associated quantitative measures: multimodal MRI methods, multimodal deep learning, and biomechanical simulations. This will provide a convergent approach, thereby allowing us to (1) test hypotheses about the spatiotemporal basis of muscle coordination in a consilient way, and (2) develop objective quantitative measures that are required for understanding the complex biomechanical system as well as for predicting the functional outcomes after various reconstruction methods. The first proof of concept study published by the PI and the team identified the functional units of speech tasks using the sparse non-negative matrix factorization framework, in which the magnitude and angle of displacements from tagged MRI were used as our input quantities. With these advances in place, we will further incorporate muscle fiber anatomy from diffusion MRI and motion tracking from tagged MRI into our framework to yield physiologically and anatomically meaningful functional units. In addition, we will create a completely novel and integrated way of directly relating the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy, learning joint representation via a multimodal deep learning technique, and linking them to biomechanical simulations. Furthermore, 3D and 4D atlases will be utilized to identify objective and quantitative measures based on our functional units analysis. Taken together, the successful implementation of our integrated framework will identify functional units that can be used for research on tongue motion, for surgical planning, and for diagnosis, prognosis, and rehabilitation in a range of speech-related disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Tongue cancer and its treatment affect tongue structure and function, yet little is known about how the changes in tongue structure due to varying degrees of resection and reconstruction affect the formation of functional units of tongue motion during speech. We propose to use novel integrated platform tools to identify functional units seamlessly with unprecedented resolution and precision. Upon success of this proposal, our integrated framework has the potential to aid in an increased understanding of speech motor control strategies in healthy controls and the patient group, thereby benefiting patients through improved diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitative strategies.",A holistic approach to identifying functional units of tongue motion during speech,9937181,R01DC018511,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Deglutition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'functional outcomes', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,588403,0.13946282088750228
"Computational Speech Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurocognitive Disorders Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is critical for planning, treatment, and research referral, but demands time and expertise often unavailable to primary care providers. Speech and language are often impaired early in the disease course of several NCDs. Previous research has demonstrated the diagnostic potential of computer speech analysis (CSA), with differences between healthy controls and disorders such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. However, there are several additional steps that must be taken to make CSA a diagnostically viable screening tool. This proposal includes a career development plan providing the applicant with training, mentorship, and experience in the following areas in order to bring CSA techniques into clinical practice: 1) computational linguistics and paralinguistics, 2) longitudinal markers of disease, and 3) design of novel technology for dissemination. As part of this training, academic and professional skills, including ethics in research, will also be expanded. Uniquely qualified mentorship and advisory teams have been selected to ensure the success of the proposed training and research. The proposed study is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, cohort investigation of two distinct research groups. The first group is a highly selected and well-characterized research cohort of healthy control, Alzheimer's disease, and MCI subjects (Group A). In Group A, the performance and reproducibility of a machine learning algorithm will be improved to distinguish Alzheimer's disease and MCI from healthy controls using CSA. Multiple regression and voxel-based morphometry will be used to better understand what may drive group differences in CSA measures in Group A as well. Clinical applications of this algorithm will then be assessed in a clinic-based cohort of patients with different NCDs (Group B) in order reduce spectrum bias likely present in prior studies. As sub-aims in both groups, possible further improvement of the algorithmic outcomes with longitudinal CSA measures will also be examined. The overall objective is to develop intuitive, reliable and reproducible CSA-based clinical measures by correlating them with established neuropsychiatric and imaging markers, determining their efficacy in clinical populations, and determining how they change over time. As a result, this research will validate specific speech traits as useful diagnostic markers of neurocognitive disease and explain why those markers differ between patient groups, both of which are major steps towards the design of novel and easily implemented tools in the screening of NCDs such as Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Computational speech analysis (CSA) has shown promise as a cost-effective, rapid screening for patients with neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) by objectively and automatically quantifying speech and language use; however, critical steps must be taken before these measures can become clinically useful. I have training and experience in the neurology of speech and language, but require additional training in computational linguistics and paralinguistics, longitudinal markers of disease including neuroimaging and neuropsychological measures, and design of novel technology for dissemination in order to bring CSA into clinical practice. In this project, we propose to investigate the utility of using CSA measures in two distinct patient groups, including a highly characterized group of research participants that includes healthy controls, Alzheimer's disease patients, and mild cognitive impairment patients (Group A), and a group of consented clinic patients with different NCDs (Group B) and to follow these two groups in prospective, longitudinal studies to correlate spontaneous speech measures with standardized linguistic, neuropsychological, and biological measures.",Computational Speech Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurocognitive Disorders,9975566,K23AG063900,"['Accent', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Linguistics', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Screening procedure', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging population', 'base', 'care providers', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient screening', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2020,188384,0.0933678962762676
"Computerized assessment of linguistic indicators of lucidity in Alzheimer's Disease dementia The focus of the proposed project is to enable automated detection and analysis of episodes of unexpected lucidity in individuals with late-stage dementia in which the individual long thought to have succumbed to dementia and lost most of his or her cognitive abilities temporarily regains the ability to communicate in a clear and coherent fashion. Currently, the evidence for the existence of these episodes is mostly anecdotal, stemming from reports by caregivers and healthcare professionals. According to these reports, clear speech and language are the most prominent features of episodes of cognitive lucidity. The very low frequency and unexpected nature of these episodes make it challenging to capture objective evidence in the form of audio or video recordings of these events needed to enable systematic and comprehensive investigations. Thus, it is necessary to develop technological solutions for automated linguistic analysis that can be used for long-term continuous monitoring of individuals in late stages of dementia. In this feasibility project, we will develop technology to address two challenging issues: a) accurate conversion of continuous speech to text, and b) automated analysis of the text to measure the degree of coherence. Without robust solutions for these problems, our ability to detect and fully capture and analyze coherent speech in a long-term monitoring setting will remain limited. We will address these problems by developing and testing a robust automatic speech recognition solution based on deep learning technology that can operate autonomously (without sending data to external servers). We will also adapt existing and develop new measures of semantic coherence that are able to work on imperfect transcripts resulting from automatic speech recognition. In order to develop and validate these tools and approaches, we will use existing datasets of spontaneous conversational speech by persons with mild and moderate dementia as well as healthy controls available as part of the Carolina Conversations Collection and Dementia Bank. This project seeks to develop a validated tool approach to automatically monitoring people with advanced dementia who are thought to have lost their cognitive abilities for potential episodes in which they unexpectedly and temporarily regain their ability to communicate coherently. We propose to develop and evaluate a system to record the speech produced in advanced dementia, convert it to text and measure the degree of coherence of the language produced with the intention to identify atypically lucid episodes.",Computerized assessment of linguistic indicators of lucidity in Alzheimer's Disease dementia,10093304,R21AG069792,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Auditory Hallucination', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health care facility', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Speech', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Transcript', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'advanced dementia', 'automated analysis', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'clear speech', 'cognitive ability', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'long term memory', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'stem', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2020,442641,0.14789061236178486
"NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF OPTIMAL MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Speech perception is one of the most important cognitive operations performed by the human brain and is fundamentally multisensory: when conversing with someone, we use both visual information from their face and auditory information from their voice. Multisensory speech perception is especially important when the auditory component of the speech is noisy, either due to a hearing disorder or normal aging. However, much less is known about the neural computations underlying visual speech perception than about those underlying auditory speech perception. To remedy this gap in existing knowledge, we will use converging evidence from two complementary measures of brain activity, BOLD fMRI and electrocorticography (ECoG). The results of these neural recording studies will be interpreted in the context of a flexible computational model based on the emerging tenet that the brain performs multisensory integration using optimal or Bayesian inference, combining the currently available sensory information with prior experience.  In the first Aim, a Bayesian model will be constructed to explain individual differences in multisensory speech perception along three axes: subjects' ability to understand noisy audiovisual speech; subjects' susceptibility to the McGurk effect, a multisensory illusion; and the time spent fixating the mouth of a talking face.  In the second Aim, we will explore the neural encoding of visual speech using voxel-wise forward encoding models of the BOLD fMRI signal. We will develop encoding models to test 7 different theories of visual speech representation from the linguistic and computer vision literature. In the third Aim, we will use ECoG to examine the neural computations for integrating visual and auditory speech, guided by the Bayesian models developed in Aim 1. First, we will study reduced neural variability for multisensory speech predicted by our model. Second, we will study the representational space of unisensory and multisensory speech. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding speech is one of the most important functions of the human brain. We use information from both the auditory modality (the voice of the person we are talking to) and the visual modality (the facial movements of the person we are talking to) to understand speech. We will use computational models, eye tracking, and brain imaging and recording techniques to study the organization and operation of the brain during audiovisual speech perception.",NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF OPTIMAL MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION,9867756,R01NS065395,"['Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oral cavity', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'audiovisual speech', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'hearing impairment', 'multisensory', 'neural model', 'normal aging', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'speech accuracy', 'theories', 'visual information', 'visual speech', 'visual tracking']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,346719,0.2855438796579336
"Studying the Laryngeal Mechanisms Underlying Dysphonia in Connected Speech Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal aims to employ the recent advancement of coupling fiberoptic endoscopes with high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) systems to obtain HSV recordings during connected speech. The goal is to study vocal mechanisms underlying dysphonia in patients with neurogenic voice disorders. The long-term goal of this line of research is to create clinically applicable quantitative methods for functional measurement of vocal fold vibration in connected speech using innovative laryngeal imaging, an approach that could advance clinical voice assessment and treatment practice. In Aim 1, HSV-based measures of vocal fold kinematics will be developed and the influence of these measures on voice audio-perceptual qualities in the patients will be determined. Image processing techniques will be developed to extract such measures from the HSV data in connected speech. The extracted measures will be given as inputs to the statistical models to determine the source of the differences between the normal controls and the patients for different speech phonetic contexts and words. This aim provides an unbiased HSV-based method to predict voice quality. Developing such HSV-based methodology for functional laryngeal examination in connected speech can enhance clinical voice assessment. In addition, better understanding the influence of phonetic context would lead to optimizing the protocols for functional voice assessment through laryngeal imaging in connected speech. In Aim 2, machine learning approaches will be employed to discover hidden physics and unknown laryngeal mechanisms of voice production in the dysphonic patients. The findings of this project will help make necessary adjustments in biomechanical or physiological characteristics of vocal folds to enhance voice quality in patients with neurogenic voice disorders. Therefore, the outcome of this research will aid clinicians in properly selecting, and developing new treatment strategies (therapeutic, medicinal, or surgical), which are based on the gained knowledge of laryngeal mechanisms of dysphonia. The proposed research is in harmony with multiple priority areas of the NIDCD, described in the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan. Both aims support Priority 3 (improve methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention) through developing objective HSV-based measures and predicting the voice quality. Comparing laryngeal mechanisms in normal and disordered voices addresses Priority 1 (deepen our understanding of the normal function of the systems of human communication). Both aims propose to study laryngeal mechanisms in patients with neurogenic and functional voice disorders, which addresses Priority 2 (increase our knowledge about conditions that alter or diminish communication and health). Project Narrative  The goal of this proposal is to determine laryngeal mechanisms underlying dysphonia in connected speech, which will lead to development of clinically applicable quantitative methods for functional laryngeal examination in connected speech using laryngeal imaging.

"Using Speech Acoustics to Reveal Motor Disruptions in Psychosis Project summary The goal of this project is to investigate the feasibility of using speech acoustics as a clinical biomarker in individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for developing psychosis. There is evidence that disruptions to cortico-cerebellar circuits in individuals experiencing attenuated psychosis symptoms impact motor control of the face and limbs. This proposal would be the first study to examine whether these motor disruptions in high-risk populations also affect the complex motor control required for speech. In Aim 1 an instrumental approach will be used to investigate the acoustic correlates of psychosis risk. Specifically, speech data will be collected to investigate fine-grained acoustic properties of vowels and consonants in simple repetition tasks as well as during more naturalistic conversational speech. The speech of CHR young adults will be compared to age-matched healthy controls to discover if there are group differences in the speech acoustics that allow us to classify speech samples into healthy and clinical groups. To enable fast, reliable analysis, machine learning-based algorithms will be used to measure the acoustics speech properties of interest. In Aim 2, the speech properties measured in Aim 1 will be compared to other behavioral measures, in order to discover if they correlate with several measures of cerebellar dysfunction (posture control, procedural learning, and motor timing) that are known to occur in CHR individuals. These measures will provide convergent validity for these novel speech measures. Cognitive capabilities which are related and unrelated to speech and motor control will also be assessed, to provide specificity and divergent validity to these measures. In Aim 3, the links between speech features and changes in symptom severity will be assessed at two time points, connecting changes in speech motor control to longitudinal changes in the progression of the symptoms over 12 months. These investigations may reveal speech as a novel and easily-collected biomarker enabling early detection of psychosis risk. Project narrative The goal of this proposal is to determine whether speech patterns can signal vulnerability to psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Speech samples will be collected from high-risk and matched healthy control participants in order to: determine if there are abnormalities in the acoustics of vowels and consonants; evaluate if these properties map on to dysfunction of the cerebellum (a brain region impacted in the development of psychosis that also plays a role in speech motor control); and relate these properties to symptom severity and illness progression. This study will lay the groundwork for the use of speech as an inexpensive, non-invasive, and mechanistically-relevant metric that will ultimately support earlier identification and facilitate timely treatment.",Using Speech Acoustics to Reveal Motor Disruptions in Psychosis,9898478,R21MH119677,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Articulators', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellar Diseases', 'Cerebellum', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Control Groups', 'Cueing for speech', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Fingers', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Larynx', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Roter', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'tool', 'vocal control', 'young adult']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,185000,0.300409983810214
"Dynamics of Vocal Tract Shaping ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to wed state-of-the-art technology for imaging the vocal tract with a linguistically informed analysis of dynamic vocal tract constriction actions in order to understand the control and production of the compositional units of spoken language. We have pioneered the use of real time MRI for speech imaging to illuminate articulatory dynamics and to understand how these emerge lawfully from the combined effects of vocal tract constriction events distributed over space (subparts of the tract) and over time. This project has developed and refined a novel real time MRI acquisition ability, making possible current reconstruction rates of up to 96 frames per second, quadrupling current imaging speeds. Data show clear real- time movements of the lips, tongue, velum and epiglottis, providing exquisite information about the spatiotemporal properties of speech gestures in both the oral and pharyngeal portions of the vocal tract. The project has also developed novel noise-mitigated image-synchronized strategies to record speech in-situ during imaging, as well as image processing strategies for deriving linguistically meaningful measures from the data, demon- strating the utility of this approach for linguistic studies of speech communication in a variety of languages. Using our direct access to dynamic information on vocal tract shaping, we investigate vocal tract shaping in three-dimensions as the composition of spatiotemporally coordinated vocal tract action units. This project's specific aims go beyond the dynamic shaping of individual vowels and consonants-postures over time-to examine more complex structuring of articulation-namely, the local and global influences governing linguistic control, temporal coherence and multi-unit coordination. The advances in our technical approach enable a series of studies that leverage: (i) unprecedented high-speech imaging with dynamic rtMRI to consider the prosodic modulation of temporally rapid and temporally coherent speech units; (ii) innovative multi-plane 3D imaging capability to inform the computational identification of linguistic control regimes; and (iii) a large- scale rtMRI corpus ad concomitant machine learning advances to move toward a principled account of system-level co-variability in space and time, both within and among individuals. This symbiotic theory-driven and data-driven research strategy will yield significant innovations in understanding spoken communication. It is no exaggeration to say that the advent of real-time MRI for speech has initiated a dramatic scientific change in the nature of speech production research by allowing for models of production driven by rich quantitative articulatory data. The project is having broad impact through the free dissemination of the unique rtMRI data corpora, tools and models-already used worldwide for research and teaching-and societal out- reach through its website and lay media coverage. Understanding articulatory compositional structure and cross-linguistic potentialities also has critical translational significance impacting the assessment and remediation of speech disorders, as our collaborative work on glossectomy and apraxia has begun to demonstrate. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time imaging of the moving vocal tract with MRI has made direct movies of speech production possible, allowing an investigation of the articulatory composition of speech in healthy adults and illuminating the articulatory dissolution and lack of coherence often found in spoken language disorders. This technology platform, coupled with a linguistically driven theoretical framework that understands speech as composed of articulatory units, provides a scientific foothold for evidence-driven assessment and remediation of speech breakdown in clinical populations, including articulatory remediation and training and deploying assistive technologies for the impaired (automatic speech recognition, machine speech synthesis), and has potential broad impact on the clinical needs of those with swallowing disorders, sleep apnea, or facing recovery of speech function after stroke or surgery. Further, because speech presents the only example of rapid, cognitively- controlled, internal movements of the body, the unique challenges of speech production imaging offer the wider biomedical imaging community traction for advances that improve temporal and spatial image resolution-advances with potential import for cardiac and other imaging.",Dynamics of Vocal Tract Shaping,9829092,R01DC007124,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Air Movements', 'Apraxias', 'Articulation', 'Articulators', 'Beds', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Development', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Epiglottis structure', 'Event', 'German population', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Larynx', 'Lateral', 'Linguistics', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Pattern', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cohesion', 'computerized tools', 'constriction', 'data tools', 'dexterity', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'movie', 'novel', 'outreach', 'phonology', 'post stroke', 'program dissemination', 'public health relevance', 'real-time images', 'reconstruction', 'remediation', 'shape analysis', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech synthesis', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'tongue apex', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,467515,0.3044822393919663
"Wearable silent speech technology to enhance impaired oral communication Project Summary/Abstract The long-term objectives of this project are to obtain a deeper understanding how articulatory movement patterns are mapped to speech particularly when there is no vocal fold vibration (silent speech) and then to develop a novel, wearable assistive technology called silent speech interface (SSI) to assist the impaired oral communication for individuals in need (e.g., individuals after laryngectomy, surgical removal of larynx to treat advanced laryngeal cancer). Designed for daily use, the SSI contains a wearable magnetic device and a small camera for tongue and lip motion tracking, respectively, and an articulation-to-speech synthesizer to output natural sounding speech that preserves the speakerâs voice characteristics. Specific Aims of the proposal include to (1) determine the articulatory patterns of normal (vocalized) and silent speech, produced by both healthy talkers and people after laryngectomy, (2) develop a wearable, wireless magnetic device for real-time tongue and lip motion tracking, and (3) synthesize speech from articulation directly. There are currently limited alternative communication options for people who have undergone laryngectomy. These options include esophageal speech, tracheo-esophageal speech, and use of an artificial larynx (or electrolarynx). These solutions are either invasive or difficult to use, and all of them result in a hoarse or mechanical/robotic sounding voice, which can be difficult to understand. In contrast, the SSI in this application is non-invasive, easy-to-use, and produces natural sounding speech and may even preserve the patientâs voice identity. We have exciting preliminary results that support the feasibility of the project including that (1) we have recently developed a wireless magnetic device for tongue motion, and (2) we have demonstrated real- time articulation-to-speech synthesis with a 90% word accuracy (judged by a human listener). In this project, we will further reduce the size of the wireless device and make it wearable and conduct articulation-to-speech algorithms by studying 30 participants after laryngectomy and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. If successful, the proposed research will enhance human health by making an impact on individuals after laryngectomy and potentially to a broader range of other speech and voice disorders. In addition, the technology will have an impact to the speech science field by providing a fist-time-ever tool for potential large- scale tongue motion data collection and have a variety of broader implications including visual feedback-based secondary language training and speech therapy, which may benefit millions of people with motor speech deficits in the United States. Project Narrative Silent speech interfaces (SSI) is a novel assistive technology for enhancing the oral communication for people who are unable to produce speech sounds (e.g., individuals who undergo laryngectomy, removal of larynx to treat advanced laryngeal cancer). The proposed SSI is a wearable device for tongue motion tracking and produces synthesized, natural sounding speech that preserves the patientâs voice characteristics in real-time, which holds potential to enhance the speech health and quality of life of laryngectomees. The technology also has potential for a variety of broader applications including visual feedback-based secondary language training and speech therapy.",Wearable silent speech technology to enhance impaired oral communication,9994877,R01DC016621,"['Acoustics', 'Age', 'Alaryngeal Speech', 'Algorithms', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Articulation', 'Articulators', 'Characteristics', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electrolarynx', 'Electromagnetics', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Esophageal Speech', 'Excision', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hoarseness', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal Prosthesis', 'Laryngectomee', 'Laryngectomy', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'Speech Synthesizers', 'Speech Therapy', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Tracer', 'Tracheoesophageal Speech', 'United States', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Voice Quality', 'Wireless Technology', 'alternative communication', 'auditory feedback', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'language training', 'machine learning algorithm', 'millisecond', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oral communication', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'sound', 'speech synthesis', 'tool', 'vibration', 'visual feedback', 'vocal cord', 'wearable device']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2020,580870,0.3278388876084891
"Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease ABSTRACT Dr. Kara Smith is a Movement Disorders neurologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) whose goal is to become an independent investigator focused on early cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD). Her long-term goal is to develop speech markers of cognitive impairment in PD. Cognitive impairment occurs in the majority of PD patients, leading to increased mortality and decreased quality of life. The current diagnostic tools are resource-intensive and have limited sensitivity. Treatments are often offered late in the course of cognitive decline and do not provide optimal benefit. Speech markers could improve detection, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in PD. Speech markers could be monitored frequently and remotely via mobile technology, capturing sensitive, quantitative data about cognitive function in the context of patientsâ daily life and in response to therapeutics. Dr. Smithâs role as a clinical movement disorders specialist ideally positions her to lead the application of advanced speech and language research to feasible, patient-oriented tools for real-life clinical practice and clinical trials. Dr. Smith has assembled an expert interdisciplinary mentorship team ideally suited for the goals of this innovative proposal. Dr. Smith and her team have previously shown that a) speech acoustic markers are associated with cognitive function in non-demented PD patients, and b) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment had linguistic deficits including pauses within utterances and grammaticality. Building on these results, Dr. Smith proposes to study speech and language more comprehensively in PD patients with and without mild cognitive impairment and controls to confirm these preliminary results and identify additional biomarkers. The aims of this study will be 1) to develop algorithms using speech acoustic markers to categorize by cognitive status, 2) to identify linguistic markers associated with mild cognitive impairment in PD, and 3) to assess on-line syntactic processing in PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The overall goal of the proposal is to identify speech and language markers of early cognitive dysfunction that can be further refined, validated and implemented using mobile technology into a larger scale, longitudinal R01 proposal. Further work will also address the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these speech markers. Dr. Smithâs rigorous training plan includes a Masterâs degree, linguistics and speech motor physiology courses, and experience in signal processing and speech acoustic analysis. Through her training goals, she will advance her knowledge and skills in patient-centered outcomes measures and instrument validation. She will gain experience in research leadership, presentation and dissemination of scientific work, and in grant writing, culminating in an R01 proposal. This K23 award will be critical for Dr. Smith to establish an independent career as a PD clinician-scientist at the unique intersection of speech and language science and cognitive impairment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Speech markers have the potential to improve diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinsonâs disease (PD). Although the majority of PD patients will develop cognitive impairment, the tools available to assess and treat this disabling complication are fraught with limitations. As a detailed and quantitative assessment tool, speech markers may increase sensitivity to early cognitive dysfunction and to changes over time compared with current measures. They may be automated and then implemented through mobile technology to increase patientsâ access to cognitive symptom monitoring outside of the clinic setting. Dr. Smithâs proposed career development plan has potential to fill a major gap in PD research by making inexpensive and easy-to-use cognitive assessment tools accessible to patients in rural and international settings, and by fueling clinical trials to discover new therapeutics capable of slowing cognitive decline in PD.",Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease,9883772,K23DC016656,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical movement disorder', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'common symptom', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'language processing', 'large scale data', 'lexical retrieval', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'motor deficit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2020,189216,0.09796580526637136
"Perception of dysarthric speech: An objective model of dysarthric speech evaluation with actionable outcomes The trained ear of the speech-language pathologist is the gold standard assessment tool for clinical practice in motor speech disorders. However, perceptual judgments are vulnerable to bias and their relationship with estimates of listener intelligibility â the final arbiter of speech goodness â is indeterminate. Interpretable, objective, and robust outcome measures that provide targets for treatment are urgently needed in order to provide more precise care and reliably monitor patient progress. Based on theoretical models of speech perception, in our previous grants we have developed a novel set of outcome measures that provide a multi- dimensional intelligibility profile (MIP) by using custom speech stimuli and a new coding strategy that allows us to capture the types of errors that listeners make when listening to dysarthric speech. This has led to a more complete intelligibility profile that codifies these errors at different levels of granularity, from global to discrete. Simultaneously, we have also developed a computational model for evaluation of dysarthric speech capable of reliably estimating a limited set of intelligibility measures directly from the speech acoustics. To date, both the outcome measures and the objective model have been evaluated on cross-sectional data only. In this renewal application, our principal goal is to evaluate specific hypotheses regarding expected changes in this multidimensional intelligibility profile as a result of different intervention instruction conditions (loud, clear, slow). A secondary goal of the proposal is to further refine our objective model to predict the complete intelligibility profile and to evaluate its ability to detect intelligibility changes within individual speakers. This is critical for clinicians who currently have no objective ways to assess the value of their interventions. With the aim of improving the standard of care through technology, the long-term goal of this proposal is to develop stand-alone objective outcome measures for dysarthria that can provide clinicians with reliable treatment targets. Such applications have the potential to dramatically alter the current standard of care in speech pathology for patients with neurological disease or injury. Furthermore, these applications also have the potential to reduce health disparities by partially automating clinical intervention and providing easier access to these services to those in remote areas or in underdeveloped countries. Â  There is an urgent need in the field of speech-language pathology for objective outcome measures of speech intelligibility that provide clinicians with actionable information regarding treatment targets. This proposal seeks to leverage theoretical advances in speech intelligibility to evaluate the sensitivity of a novel multidimensional intelligibility profile that quantifies the perceptual effects of speech change. Using listener transcriptions of dysarthric speech, along with a suite of automated acoustic metrics, the predictive model uses machine-learning algorithms to learn the relationship between speech acoustics and listener percepts. Ultimately, this model will allow clinicians to predict the outcomes of an intervention strategy to assess its utility for a patient. This has the potential to dramatically alter the current standard of care in speech pathology for patients with neurological disease or injury.",Perception of dysarthric speech: An objective model of dysarthric speech evaluation with actionable outcomes,9850868,R01DC006859,"['Acoustics', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysarthria', 'Ear', 'Educational Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Loudness', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathologist', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Pathology', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech-Language Pathology', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'lexical', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'signal processing', 'speech in noise', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDCD,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2020,307097,0.3108439132585689
