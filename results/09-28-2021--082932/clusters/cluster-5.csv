"Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood Several million units of donor platelets are transfused annually in the US and Europe to treat patients undergoing radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or organ transplant surgery. Although transfusions of donor- derived platelets are an effective way to treat thrombocytopenic patients, numerous concerns have been raised due to the increase in demand, the five-day shelf-life, and the possibilities for contamination. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow and are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The long-term objective of this proposal is to generate platelets ex vivo from HSPC- enriched umbilical cord blood that will allow us to address a vast public need. Recent studies have shown that the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can greatly affect expansion of progenitor cells, but can reduce MK differentiation efficiency. My central hypothesis is that epigenetic and transcriptional changes prime or desensitize HSPC to MK differentiation cues. To investigate the role of epigenetic signals during HSPC-to- MK transition, I propose to perform high-throughput ChIP and RNA-sequencing to discover differentially active regulatory elements between expanded (low potential) and fresh cord blood HSPCs. This highly interdisciplinary and collaborative proposal utilizes computational biology and machine-learning to identify differentially active regulatory elements, and associate genetic features with MK fate. To validate my findings and establish a causal relationship between histone modifications of certain regions and MK potential, I will generate a dCas9-fusion protein that can directly manipulate the epigenetic marker at a targeted site. My findings will establish the mechanism of action of chromatin-modifying agents such as HDACi, and the causal relationship between the epigenome and MK differentiation. My highly collaborative proposal with the Miller, Bagheri, and Mahmud lab will substantially enhance our understanding of hematopoietic differentiation toward manufacturing platelets. Project Narrative More than two million platelet units from donors are used to treat patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy every year, but short shelf-life, increasing demand, and risk of contamination keep platelets in strained supply. In my proposed study, I will apply a panel of small molecules to expand and differentiate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood into platelet-producing cells. My work will identify the role of epigenetic modifications during the culture process, and elucidate new strategies to efficiently manufacture platelets from culture.",Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood,9345356,F31HL134331,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Computational Biology', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deacetylase', 'Deacetylation', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Europe', 'GATA1 gene', 'GATA2 transcription factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Growth', 'HDAC3 gene', 'HDAC6 gene', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Histones', 'Influentials', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Microtubules', 'Modification', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'Supervision', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Tryptophan', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Valproic Acid', 'Work', 'alpha Tubulin', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'desensitization', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput screening', 'histone acetyltransferase', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'large scale production', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'sarcoma', 'small molecule', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,38039,0.07918006000200342

"Centrosomin and centrosomes in cell division    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Centrioles and centrosomes are conserved organelles in animals that are essential for cell signaling, cell division, and for specialized roles in differentiated cells, impacting organ function in whole animals. Mutations in proteins that function in centriole/basal body assembly or function, or which impact the cilia that grow from basal bodies, comprise the etiological basis for an expanding category of developmental and disease genes. Mutations in genes for other centrosomal proteins like CDK5RAP2, Pericentrin, sas4 and Aspm, are the root cause of related syndromes that affect brain and/or body size, yet an understanding of the connection between function at the centrosome and the causes of disease are unclear. To understand the disease or developmental process, we must first understand the functions of the proteins affected. Here we focus on the Centrosomin family of proteins. A key breakthrough came with mutation studies of Drosophila Centrosomin (CNN), showing that it is required in an early process of mitotic centrosome assembly. Centrosomes are the major microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) in animal cells and are required for efficient assembly of microtubules into the bipolar spindle apparatus at mitosis. The molecular functions of centrosome and centriole proteins are largely uncharacterized; indeed, the centrosome ""parts list"" is still being compiled. We employ Drosophila as a model system to investigate the molecular function of Centrosomin (Cnn) and the proteins and processes it impacts. With this model we combine classical and molecular genetic approaches with cell biology and biochemistry, capitalizing on the efficiency and rich tool chest that this model affords. The estimated 70% of human disease genes with homologs in Drosophila validate its use as a model for vertebrate biology. Yet, by employing a mouse mutant for CDK5RAP2, a mouse CNN family member, we bridge these systems and achieve a closer understanding of the pathology that underlies mutations in CDK5RAP2, which cause microcephaly in humans. CNN contains two conserved modules. One domain, near the N-terminus, regulates microtubule assembly at centrosomes, while the second domain at the C-terminus regulates actin organization into cleavage furrows. The first domain functions to recruit a microtubule assembly factor to centrosomes, while the second domain binds directly to Centrocortin (Cen), a novel factor required for cleavage furrow assembly. In mice, CDK5RAP2 mutant cells lose centriole engagement and cohesion, inducing centriole amplification. At mitosis, these excess centrosomes induce multipolar spindle assembly, implicating a role for CDK5RAP2 in centrosome clustering at mitosis. The multiple centrioles also template multiple primary cilia in CDK5RAP2 mutant cells. These findings pave a path toward a deeper understanding of the key processes that centrosomes regulate and that govern the regulation of centrosome replication. Our specific aims are to: 1. Determine the mechanisms of MTOC regulation by CNN, 2. Define the role of Centrocortin and its cooperation with CNN in cleavage furrow assembly, and 3. Define the functions of CDK5RAP2 in the mouse. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mutations in genes that function at centrioles and centrosomes cause a host of human disorders due to their importance in so many developmental and physiological processes. These ailments include polycystic kidney disease, deafness, hydrocephaly, obesity, microcephaly, and more. The goal of this proposal is to gain molecular and mechanistic understanding of centrioles and centrosomes, structures found in nearly every cell, in flies and mice and discern the pathology of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH).

"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7799797,R01DE017471,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autologous', 'BMP2 gene', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen Type I', 'Collagraft', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Marrow', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor Activation', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Development', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'UC06', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial repair', 'dosage', 'drug discovery', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'long bone', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'osteogenic', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,317080,0.25645159568212517
"Transcriptional co-regulators in epidermis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The stratified mammalian epidermis develops from somatic ectoderm by the progressive addition and differentiation of superficial epidermal layers (1). After the initial morphogenesis, the epidermis is maintained by homeostatic mechanisms whereby keratinocytes move from the proliferating basal cell layer towards the surface as they undergo a series of differentiation steps, ultimately undergoing cell death. One role of keratinocyte differentiation is the formation of an effective permeability barrier, which depends on the regulated expression of a large battery of genes encoding components of the cornified and granular layers (2). Under funding by the parent grant, we are using molecular biology to investigate the role of a single transcription factor, the Grainyhead-like transcription factor Get1/Grhl3 (3-5), in epidermal differentiation. In contrast, in this revision application, we propose a systems biology approach to computationally generate transcriptional regulatory network for the process of epidermal differentiation. Thus, this application leads to a new direction and differs from the parent grant in two important ways: First, it expands the scope of the study to transcriptional regulatory networks in epidermal development in general, and second, it incorporates the methods of systems biology; thus the application is consistent with one of the key emphasis areas of this RFA (Developmental Biology - Systems biology). The specific goals are to: 1) Generate global gene expression data over the time course of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation; and 2) Use the time course gene expression data from 1, other genome-wide expression data, DNA motif information, functional annotation, and literature mining to infer transcriptional networks in epidermal differentiation. The goal of this project is also to build a new interdisciplinary team between the Andersen laboratory, whose primary expertise is in molecular/developmental biology, and Alex Ihler, a new assistant professor whose primary expertise is in graphical models, Bayesian inference methods, machine learning, and data mining. The contributions of the Ihler group -- the mathematical modeling required to define the networks -- will allow approaches and advances in our understanding of epidermal differentiation that would not be attainable without this collaboration.               Defective epidermal differentiation and disrupted barrier formation are salient features of several skin diseases, including childhood eczema and psoriasis.

"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7878908,R01DE017471,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autologous', 'BMP2 gene', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen Type I', 'Collagraft', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Marrow', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor Activation', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Development', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'UC06', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial repair', 'dosage', 'drug discovery', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'long bone', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'osteogenic', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2009,88138,0.25645159568212517

"Centrosomin and Centrosomes in Cell Division DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The equal distribution of chromosomes into daughter cells depends upon the accurate assembly of the mitotic spindle at cell division. The inappropriate segregation of chromosomes leads to aneuploidy, which can result in cell death or carcinogenesis. Proteins that control the cytoskeleton, including those that regulate microtubule dynamics and spindle assembly, can be oncogenic when altered. Our goal is to understand the function of the centrosome in cytoskeletal organization and other cellular processes. To achieve this, we must understand the roles of proteins that function at the centrosome. Our main focus is on Centrosomin (Cnn), a major core component of centrosomes in Drosophila. Cnn is a phosphoprotein with three putative leucine zippers, extensive coiled-coil domains, and two novel motifs that are highly conserved across species. Cnn is required to assemble functional centrosomes at mitosis. In somatic cells that lack Cnn, mitosis occurs efficiently, but by an alternate, anastral pathway. We hypothesize that the anastral pathway for mitosis may be a vestige of an evolutionary precursor to the current centrosomal mode of mitosis that is found in most animal cells. The purpose of this project is to understand the functions of Cnn and centrosomes in cell division, and to define the anastral pathway for mitosis. Three specific aims are designed to accomplish these goals. The first aim is to dissect the functional domains in Cnn protein using in vivo functional and rescue assays, to examine potential human homologs by rescue of Cnn in Drosophila, and to examine the role of phosphorylation in Cnn function. Our second aim is to identify Cnn protein partners using genetic and biochemical approaches, then assay their localization in the cell, their role in centrosome function, and their role in centrosomal localization of Cnn. Our third aim is to define the anastral meiosis-like pathway that is induced in cells that lack Cnn. The mechanisms for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation at mitosis in cells that lack Cnn (and have dysfunctional centrosomes) will be investigated. n/a",Centrosomin and Centrosomes in Cell Division,7268755,R01GM068756,"['Amino Acids', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Cycle Stage', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell division', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centrosome', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromosomal Stability', 'Chromosome Segregation', 'Chromosomes', 'Coiled-Coil Domain', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Drosophila genus', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Incubated', 'Length', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Maps', 'Meiosis', 'Microtubule-Organizing Center', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic', 'Mitotic Spindle Apparatus', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Mutate', 'Normal Cell', 'Oncogenic', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Fragment', 'Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulatory Subunit PR53', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Proteins', 'Purpose', 'RNA Interference', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Sepharose', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Structure', 'Vertebrates', 'Yeasts', 'carcinogenesis', 'cell type', 'chromosome movement', 'cofactor', 'daughter cell', 'design', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'mutant', 'novel', 'protein function', 'research study', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2007,258854,0.14638732816247546
"Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The centrosome is a major microtubule-organizing center responsible for initiation of microtubule assembly in animal cells. Microtubules are important for such processes as mitosis/meiosis, cell motility, and morphogenesis, thus centrosome dysfunction causes serious human diseases, including cancers, metastasis, and birth defects. The overall aim of this application is to understand how assembly and function of the centrosome are controlled at the molecular level. The research focuses on three centrosome proteins: Aurora-A, CNN, and Cep135. A mitosis-specific kinase, Aurora-A is involved in centrosome maturation during cell division. It binds to CNN (centrosomin), which has unique properties to induce microtubule-nucleating sites through interacting with the gamma-tubulin complex. CNN also binds to a highly coiled-coiled protein, Cep135 important for maintaining the structural integrity of the centrosome. The first specific aim is to determine how the CNN activity to form microtubule-nucleating sites is controlled by Aurora-A. Effects of the change in CNN interaction with Aurora-A and its phosphorylation by the Aurora-A kinase will be examined. Additional CNN- and Aurora-A-interacting molecules will be searched using a combined two-hybrid screens and functional RNAi assays. The second objective is to dissect molecules involved in organization of microtubule-nucleating sites. Microtubule formation onto cytoplasmic assemblies induced by CNN overexpression will be characterized in vivo and in vitro. Proteins required for microtubule nucleation will be identified by in vitro tests of microtubule polymerization onto isolated CNN assemblies from which different molecules are stripped off and added back. Attempts will be made to polymerize microtubules onto microbeads coated with CNN and other potential molecules. The third objective is to examine assembly of mammalian centrosomes by supplementing Cep135-depleted cells with exogenous Cep135 and CNN. The process of disintegration and reformation of the functional centrosome will be monitored by fluorescence and electron microscopy. The Aurora-A gene is a tumor-susceptibility gene and its overexpression causes cancer formation. As centrosome abnormalities are implicated in the origin of chromosome instability and cancer pathogenesis, the study will be useful in establishing strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers.       n/a",Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes,7102736,R01GM055735,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'C-terminal', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell division', 'Cells', 'Centrosome', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Diagnosis', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meiosis', 'Microspheres', 'Microtubule Polymerization', 'Microtubule-Organizing Center', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Site', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tubulin', 'Work', 'aurora-A kinase', 'cell motility', 'gamma Tubulin', 'human STK6 protein', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'mutant', 'protein distribution', 'reconstitution', 'research study', 'scaffold', 'tumor', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2007,211207,0.09558430112772552

Cnn is required to assemble functional centrosomes at mitosis. In somatic cells that lack Cnn, mitosis occurs efficiently, but by an alternate, anastral pathway. We hypothesize that the anastral pathway for mitosis may be a vestige of an evolutionary precursor to the current centrosomal mode of mitosis that is found in most animal cells. The purpose of this project is to understand the functions of Cnn and centrosomes in cell division, and to define the anastral pathway for mitosis. Three specific aims are designed to accomplish these goals. The first aim is to dissect the functional domains in Cnn protein using in vivo functional and rescue assays, to examine potential human homologs by rescue of Cnn in Drosophila, and to examine the role of phosphorylation in Cnn function. Our second aim is to identify Cnn protein partners using genetic and biochemical approaches, then assay their localization in the cell, their role in centrosome function, and their role in centrosomal localization of Cnn. Our third aim is to define the anastral meiosis-like pathway that is induced in cells that lack Cnn. The mechanisms for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation at mitosis in cells that lack Cnn (and have dysfunctional centrosomes) will be investigated. n/a",Centrosomin and Centrosomes in Cell Division,7101773,R01GM068756,"['SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis', 'cell cycle', 'centrosome', 'chromosome movement', 'immunoprecipitation', 'mass spectrometry', 'mitotic spindle apparatus', 'phosphoproteins', 'phosphorylation', 'protein structure function', 'tissue /cell culture', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SW MED CTR,R01,2006,266585,0.14638732816247546

"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7368654,R01DE017471,[' '],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2006,246436,0.25645159568212517

"Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The centrosome is a major microtubule-organizing center responsible for initiation of microtubule assembly in animal cells. Microtubules are important for such processes as mitosis/meiosis, cell motility, and morphogenesis, thus centrosome dysfunction causes serious human diseases, including cancers, metastasis, and birth defects. The overall aim of this application is to understand how assembly and function of the centrosome are controlled at the molecular level. The research focuses on three centrosome proteins: Aurora-A, CNN, and Cep135. A mitosis-specific kinase, Aurora-A is involved in centrosome maturation during cell division. It binds to CNN (centrosomin), which has unique properties to induce microtubule-nucleating sites through interacting with the gamma-tubulin complex. CNN also binds to a highly coiled-coiled protein, Cep135 important for maintaining the structural integrity of the centrosome. The first specific aim is to determine how the CNN activity to form microtubule-nucleating sites is controlled by Aurora-A. Effects of the change in CNN interaction with Aurora-A and its phosphorylation by the Aurora-A kinase will be examined. Additional CNN- and Aurora-A-interacting molecules will be searched using a combined two-hybrid screens and functional RNAi assays. The second objective is to dissect molecules involved in organization of microtubule-nucleating sites. Microtubule formation onto cytoplasmic assemblies induced by CNN overexpression will be characterized in vivo and in vitro. Proteins required for microtubule nucleation will be identified by in vitro tests of microtubule polymerization onto isolated CNN assemblies from which different molecules are stripped off and added back. Attempts will be made to polymerize microtubules onto microbeads coated with CNN and other potential molecules. The third objective is to examine assembly of mammalian centrosomes by supplementing Cep135-depleted cells with exogenous Cep135 and CNN. The process of disintegration and reformation of the functional centrosome will be monitored by fluorescence and electron microscopy. The Aurora-A gene is a tumor-susceptibility gene and its overexpression causes cancer formation. As centrosome abnormalities are implicated in the origin of chromosome instability and cancer pathogenesis, the study will be useful in establishing strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers.       n/a",Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes,6929714,R01GM055735,"['RNA interference', 'cell component structure /function', 'cell cycle proteins', 'centrosome', 'confocal scanning microscopy', 'electron microscopy', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rabbit', 'laboratory rat', 'microtubules', 'mitotic spindle apparatus', 'molecular assembly /self assembly', 'nuclear proteins', 'phosphorylation', 'protein localization', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'time resolved data', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,R01,2005,222750,0.09558430112772552

"Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development PROJECT SUMMARY A major unanswered question is how chromatin topology coordinates human development and cellular differentiation, and how genome folding is differentially regulated in human disease. It is thought that three- dimensional (3D) chromatin organization is driven by transcriptional regulators, but fundamental mechanisms of this regulation as it relates to disease-relevant human cells have not been well explored. We propose to elucidate the temporally dynamic 3D nucleome (4DN) that underlies human cardiac differentiation, its molecular underpinnings, and the impact of mutations that underly defective 4DN organization in human congenital heart disease (CHD). CHDs are the most common birth defect and arise from abnormal heart development. The genetic basis of CHD is largely mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers (e.g. WDR5, KMT2D) and transcription factors (TFs, e.g. TBX5, GATA4), many of which also cause adult-onset arrhythmias. The impact of CHD mutations on the 4DN has not been explored. We hypothesize that 3D genome folding is highly regulated during cardiac differentiation and is impacted by disease-causing mutations in transcriptional regulators and non-coding elements. We will use iPS cell models and machine learning to elucidate dynamic 3D chromatin organization in human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells during normal and diseased cardiac differentiation. We propose 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Establish a kilobase-scale 4D map of genome folding in human cardiomyocytes (CM) and endothelial cell (EC) differentiation. We will use directed differentiation of human iPS cells towards the two major cell types of the developing heart: CMs and ECs, and using microC across a fine time course of differentiation we will define at kilobase scale the 3D organization of the genome, capturing the states of developmental intermediates and the final differentiated cells. This aim will generate an essential integrated 4DN template for discovery in cardiac differentiation. In Aim 2: we will Determine the regulatory and disease-related basis for cardiac 3D chromatin organization. We will perform microC in iPS cell lines with CHD-associated mutations in transcriptional regulators, differentiated into CMs and ECs. These findings will establish the degree to which CHD is caused by abnormal genome folding and chromatin states, with important relevance to other human cardiovascular diseases. Finally, Aim 3 will address High-throughput screening of millions of CHD and synthetic non- coding mutations with a deep-learning model of dynamic genome folding. We will build a deep-learning model predicting 3D chromatin contact frequencies across cardiac differentiation at kilobase-resolution. By introducing thousands of CHD patient deletions and other non-coding mutations in silico, we will prioritize variants likely to interact with transcriptional regulators to cause disease through disrupted genome folding. Several candidates will be validated in engineered iPS cells differentiated into CMs and ECs. These results will provide a novel platform for computational discovery of disease variant impact across diverse human diseases PROJECT NARRATIVE Congenital heart defects are present in 1-2 out of 100 births, and are caused by mutations in genes that may control the 3-dimensional organization of chromosomes. We will use human cellular models and Artificial Intelligence to understand how chromosome organization is controlled during heart development and altered by disease processes.

"Centrosome regulation of trafficking, ciliogenesis and cilia-dependent signaling PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Centrosomes are the central organizing centers of cells, performing essential functions for mitotic spindles and cilia. Diverse human diseases arise from defects to centrosomes because they impact both mitotic and ciliary functions. We discovered that cells from individuals with Down syndrome have both defective centrosomes and cilia. This opens an important new avenue for understanding the cell biological basis of Down syndrome. Because primary cilia loss is developmentally lethal, our studies will explore the role that subtle changes to centrosomes have in controlling cilia formation and function. Central to the reduced cilia function in Trisomy 21 cells, we discovered that elevated expression of the Pericentrin gene, encoded on chromosome 21, is necessary and sufficient to repress the movement of components required for both cilia formation and function from the cytoplasm to the centrosome and cilium. Pericentrin is a centrosome and intracellular trafficking scaffold protein that dramatically increases and decreases during the cell cycle, with levels lowest when cilia formation occurs and highest during mitosis. We propose that exquisite control of Pericentrin ensures cilia formation and function. However, we do not understand why the modest 1.5-fold increase in Pericentrin protein found in Down syndrome has such a profound impact on cilia. We will test how decreased and increased Pericentrin levels impact centrosomes, the interphase microtubule landscape, and satellite and vesicular trafficking, and what the consequent outcomes for cilia formation and signaling are. Excellent training opportunities exist for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the Pearson lab. We will continue to use and develop our rigorous training and experimental routines in alignment with the NIH guidelines for increasing rigor and reproducibility. Collaborations with other labs that specialize in electron microscopy and machine learning quantitative analyses will expand the innovation and impact of our studies of intracellular trafficking. In summary, this proposal will illuminate how the precise control of the human disease protein, Pericentrin, is coordinated with the cell cycle to ensure proper primary cilia formation and signaling required for normal development. This application aims to elucidate fundamental cell biological events in intracellular trafficking, cilia formation and cilia-dependent signaling that are commonly defective in human disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Down syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and, like ciliopathy patients, individuals with Down syndrome display variably penetrant pathologies including cardiac septal defects, craniofacial dysmorphology and cognitive abnormalities. We discovered that Trisomy 21 and elevated gene dosage of the Pericentrin gene present on chromosome 21 inhibits cilia formation and signaling. Our research aims to determine the fundamental cellular basis for cilia defects in Down syndrome and how changes to Pericentrin levels tune centrosome structure, intracellular trafficking, ciliogenesis and cilia-dependent signaling during the cell cycle.","Centrosome regulation of trafficking, ciliogenesis and cilia-dependent signaling",10028106,R01GM138415,"['Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Stage', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Centrioles', 'Centrosome', 'Chromosome 21', 'Cilia', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Cytoplasm', 'Cytoplasmic Protein', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Down Syndrome', 'Dysmorphology', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Septal Defects', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interphase', 'Machine Learning', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scaffolding Protein', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tubulin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'cell assembly', 'ciliopathy', 'cilium biogenesis', 'craniofacial', 'dosage', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'overexpression', 'particle', 'pericentrin', 'recruit', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'trafficking', 'training opportunity', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,306408,0.03291986530309215
