"Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development Project Summary Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids hold great promise for tissue engineering and personalized drug screening, but obtaining the desired multicellular organization and function from these systems is usually performed in an ad hoc fashion without forward design specification. Recently, we reported successful liver bud formation containing stromal cells, vascular tube-like structures and hematopoiesis-like processes by synthetically inducing diversity in GATA6 expression from a single hiPSC population. This accomplishment suggests that expanding circuit logic operations to artificially control differentiation drivers at particular bifurcations in lineage specification could profoundly impact the complexity and functionality of organoids. In this project, we bring together mathematical modeling, machine learning, optimization, and innovative synthetic biology techniques to elucidate and design fundamental decision and communication rules for guiding cells into complex, heterogeneous tissues. Our overarching hypothesis is that appropriate timing and predictable stochastic control of the expression of intracellular and extracellular factors is critical for redirecting lineage choices in order to elicit desired multicellular organization from a population of differentiating cells. We will develop synthetic tools for sensing differentiation stages of iPSC-derived organoids and construct and characterize a stochastic commitment switch in an inducible reporter system. These tools will be integrated in synthetic gene circuits for engineering emergent multicellular organization through stochastic temporal control of developmental factors. The modular commitment switches developed in this project will be capable of exploring how the degree of subpopulation biasing of cell fate decisions and level of cell fate synchronization at bipotent differentiation stages impacts self-assembly and emergent multicellular organization of an organoid. Our aims - executed through a closed loop of computational and experimental investigations - will shed insight on how generalizable methods of controlled manipulation can elicit desired organoid-level emergent properties. We will combine synthetic biology and advanced computational techniques to accelerate an ongoing revolution — the application of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to regenerative and personalized medicine. We will integrate new genetic circuits into hiPSCs that sense changes in endogenous gene expression and activate expression of other genes in order to redirect organoid differentiation to desired outcomes with specific 3D organization and arrangements of cell types and functions. Our design of sophisticated gene regulatory networks will be based on advanced optimization techniques rooted in control theory and machine learning, enabling precise and predictable generation of desired 3D structures and organoid functions.",Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development,10155771,R01EB030946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Drug Screening', 'Endoderm', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth Factor', 'Guide RNA', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mesoderm', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Visual', 'base', 'cell type', 'computing resources', 'control theory', 'design', 'engineering design', 'extracellular', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'precision drugs', 'programs', 'self assembly', 'self organization', 'sensor', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cell population', 'synthetic biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,682610
"Nuclear Organization and Function PROJECT SUMMARY. Proper regulation of gene expression is essential for cell differentiation and homeostasis. Most of our understanding of the mechanisms that control the transcription process comes from studies of the one-dimensional genome i.e. the 10 nm chromatin fiber. However, the genome is folded in the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear space, and the relationship between this organization and gene expression is poorly understood. Using Drosophila as a model system, where it is feasible to obtain 250 bp resolution Hi-C data, we have found that the genome is folded into only one type of domain, which we call compartmental domains. These domains precisely correlate with the transcriptional state of their sequences. Compartmental domains are also found in other lower eukaryotes. Based on this, we propose that compartmental domains represent an evolutionarily conserved principle of genome 3D organization. Drosophila and lower eukaryotes either lack CTCF or this protein is unable to stop cohesin extrusion. However, CTCF can interfere with the progression of cohesin extrusion in vertebrates, which in turn affects other types of interactions in the genome. Here we suggest extending concepts learned from the analysis of 3D organization in Drosophila to mammals by proposing an ambitious and substantive multi-disciplinary approach combining genetics, epigenomics, computational biology, and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into disease-relevant tissues. The hypothesis underlying the proposed experiments is based on the idea that, rather than the prevalent view of large compartments containing smaller TADs, the mammalian genome is organized by conserved principles into relatively small compartmental domains. Cohesin extrusion operates on top of the compartmental domain scaffold and affects its organization. To test this novel hypothesis, we will deplete specific proteins present in complexes required for various aspects of the transcription process. We will also deplete protein complexes responsible for H3K27me3- and H3K9me3-dependent silencing. We will then use Micro-C XL to obtain very high-resolution interaction data and examine effects of protein depletion on the formation of self-interacting domains and in the interactions between these domains. These effects will be examined in the presence and absence of cohesin in order to understand the contribution of loop extrusion to enhancer-promoter interaction frequency. We will examine the predictability of 3D genome organization from one-dimensional epigenetic information using machine learning computational tools. We will study the logic of CTCF loop formation by analyzing the local chromatin environment around CTCF sites able or unable to form loops of different strengths using a new computational tool we have developed. Principles learned from these experiments will be tested by analyzing changes in 3D organization and their relationship to gene expression during the differentiation of hESCs into pancreatic cells. Results from this work will fill critical gaps in our understanding of the relationship between 3D chromatin organization and transcription, and its possible role in human disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will analyze the mechanisms by which the three-dimensional organization of the genetic material in the nucleus is established and maintained. This organization is critical for the regulation of gene expression, and the results will be important to understand how transcription is controlled during stem cell differentiation or during reprograming of somatic cells. This knowledge will be essential to understand the basic biology of the cell nucleus and the origin of human genetic disease or cancer and could help guide the use of stem cell therapy to treat human diseases.",Nuclear Organization and Function,10083368,R35GM139408,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Hi-C', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Genetics', 'Knowledge', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Nuclear', 'Pancreas', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Process', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mammalian genome', 'novel', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'scaffold', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell therapy']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,431097
"Deep learning models to predict primitive streak formation in human development Project Summary Congenital birth defects affect an estimated 3% of live births. To develop effective treatment strategies, a thorough understanding of early human development is necessary. Our lab recently developed and in vitro model of human gastrulation, the process by which the three germ layers (endoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm) are formed around week three of gestation. This so-called “gastruloid” model is formed by treating human embryonic stem cells with purified differentiation factors that cause them to self-organize into a pattern resembling a gastrulating embryo. One of the key events during this process is formation of the primitive streak—a migration of specialized mesenchymal stem cells along the embryonic midline that will form all mesodermal tissues including the heart, lungs, blood vessels, and cells of the circulatory system. At the same time, cells on the periphery of the embryo begin forming extraembryonic mesoderm, which will ultimately become placental tissue. Despite the critical importance of these cell fate changes, it is currently unclear which population of embryonic stem cells will differentiate to form primitive streak or extraembryonic mesoderm and how these cell fate decisions are determined. The research objective of this fellowship proposal is to understand when and how human stem cells differentiate into primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm during gastrulation. My overall approach is to use time-lapse fluorescence imaging to monitor differentiation decisions in real time and at single-cell solution. I will then employ a specialized type of machine learning known as deep learning to accurately track the movement and signaling behavior of individual cells. Next, I will develop a computational model that uses a cell’s image patterns to accurately predict how each cell “chooses” between differentiation fates. The two specific research aims are: 1) to identify the subpopulation of human embryonic stem cells that will commit to primitive streak; and 2) to determine the combination of intracellular and extracellular signaling events that govern differentiation to extraembryonic mesoderm. The proposed work includes novel experimental procedures (specifically, real-time imaging of gastruloids formation in Aim 1) as well as unique neural network architectures that accurately predict binary cell fate outcomes of individual stem cells based on their signaling history. These methods will be generalizable to other biological systems. The proposed training plan focuses on generating and applying cutting-edge statistical methods tasked with full single-cell feature data incorporation in order to make robust, theoretically and biologically sound predictions about human stem cell fate decisions. A better understanding of early human development will inform future cellular therapies to prevent and treat congenital birth defects. To support my training, I have assembled a strong mentorship team with expertise in stem cell biology, live-cell imaging, machine learning methodologies, and causal inference. Project Narrative Early human development is a crucial time period in which the structures of primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm are formed and errors in cellular differentiation can have dire consequences. This fellowship proposal seeks to advance our fundamental understanding of how human embryonic stem cells decide specific differentiation fates using advanced machine learning methodologies. The findings from this work will help develop future stem cell therapies for treatment of birth defects and miscarriages in early primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm formation, ultimately improving public health.",Deep learning models to predict primitive streak formation in human development,10141600,F31HL156464,"['Affect', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brachyury protein', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Computer Models', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoderm', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Live Birth', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Mesoderm', 'Mesoderm Cell', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Primitive Streaks', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stains', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'blastomere structure', 'bone morphogenetic protein 4', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'daughter cell', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'embryonic stem cell', 'extracellular', 'fluorescence imaging', 'gastrulation', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human imaging', 'human model', 'human stem cells', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'live cell imaging', 'migration', 'molecular marker', 'movie', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'precursor cell', 'prevent', 'real-time images', 'recurrent neural network', 'repaired', 'self organization', 'self-renewal', 'skills', 'sound', 'statistical learning', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell fate', 'stem cell therapy', 'stem cells', 'time use', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2021,37550
