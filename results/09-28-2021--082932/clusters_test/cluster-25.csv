"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,10206058,R37CA232209,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'E-Cadherin', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Experimental Models', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-in', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vimentin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic signature', 'genomic profiles', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'paracrine', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,434007
"Rapid Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Low and Middle Income Countries One of the biggest cancer challenges in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is the lack of access to accurate and affordable cellular and molecular diagnostics, which are essential for making informed therapeutic decisions, in particular for breast cancer. With the increased use of low cost ultrasound, it has become possible to readily sample suspicious breast lesions with ﬁne needles (ﬁne needle aspirates, FNA). However, the workup of such specimens is often impossible in many LMIC settings. To address these barriers to diagnosis, Aikili—derived from A.I. and Akili (intelligence in Kiswahili)—seeks to enable the same-day diagnosis of breast cancer at the point-of-care using a low-cost, automated system. The Aikili system is a highly advanced stand-alone diagnostic platform capable of automated cancer diagnosis and receptor sub- typing in near real-time (< 1 hour), at a low cost (<$800 for integrated hardware and $5-10 per test). Building upon our initial development and successful clinical validation of human samples, the goal of this Phase I application is to advance the Aikili technology to signiﬁcantly improve its usability in resource-limited settings. Speciﬁcally, we propose to i) upgrade Aikili technology by incorporating a custom-designed disposable cartridge for onsite sample processing and deep learning algorithms for automatic analysis (Aim 1), and ii) evaluate the performance of the upgraded system in LMIC workﬂows through a validation study in Kenya (n = 30) (Aim 2). We will consider the Phase I project successful when we can show that the ﬁeld-optimized Aikili system accurately and reliably detects breast cancer and receptor status in human FNAs compared to accepted gold standards. Successful completion of Phase I would lead to a Phase II application for scale-up of manufacturing and a larger, multi-site clinical validation study. This platform may alter therapeutic paradigms for breast cancer patients in globally and enable appropriate use of chemotherapies and anti-estrogens in limited supply. We will develop a standalone, AI-powered diagnostic system to enable early cancer detection in low resource settings. Our system has the potential to transform cancer diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries where cytopathology is a major bottleneck; it will augment workflows by enabling non-expert healthcare workers to rapidly establish cancer diagnoses and identify molecular subtypes within 1 hour. This will inform the most appropriate therapeutic choices in collaboration with specialist physicians, as well as reduce patient loss to follow-up (LTF) by providing diagnosis in near real-time.",Rapid Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Low and Middle Income Countries,10154237,R43CA257694,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Cytopathology', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Kenya', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Logistics', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Palpable', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Underserved Population', 'University Hospitals', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast lesion', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low and middle-income countries', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'operation', 'point of care', 'prospective', 'receptor', 'usability', 'validation studies', 'years of life lost']",NCI,AIKILI BIOSYSTEMS INC.,R43,2021,400000
"Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women For the >200,000 older women who develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer yearly, adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for at least five years increases overall survival. Yet almost half of patients prescribed AET fail to take all their pills. Education- and reminder-based studies in this and a number of other settings have had disappointingly small effects on adherence, and more complex interventions have proven difficult to sustain. In this proposal we seek a better understanding of the symptoms that women describe as major barriers to AET adherence. We draw on prior research suggesting that preexisting symptoms may play an important role in patients’ experience with AET. Our proposal fills crucial gaps in our understanding by examining older and less selected subjects treated in a usual care practice, and by using a measure that is already routinely collected across the United States. Specifically, we will use the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s Distress Thermometer (DT) and its accompanying problem list, which have previously been shown to reveal a high burden of symptoms among older women with breast cancer but have not been examined in association with AET or while accounting for the wide spectrum of comorbid conditions of older women. Most cancer centers administer the DT and problem list at diagnosis or earlier in care, increasing their value for informing early intervention to help women continue their AET. We will investigate whether the DT and problem list are predictive of AET discontinuation among older women, with specific aims as follows: Aim 1 To examine the association of patient-reported distress at diagnosis with early discontinuation of AET. We will utilize electronic health record data from a cohort of incident postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients to examine the association of the DT (scored 0 to 10) measured at diagnosis with AET discontinuation in time-to-event analyses, accounting for age, osteoarthritis, and other comorbidities, and other breast cancer treatments. Aim 2. To explore the association of patient-reported symptoms at diagnosis with discontinuation of AET. In the same cohort and using the same general approach, we will explore AET discontinuation and a) patient-reported overall symptom count based on DT problem list) and b) symptom clusters (e.g., fatigue, sleep, concentration). We will use both standard regression and an innovative application of machine learning using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. With this approach, we will produce immediately actionable findings to improve adherence outcomes, by providing a means of identifying high-risk patients who are the primary targets for the development of new interventions. It could also be an important model for other conditions that are treated with aggressive treatment regimens in older patients, informing care for a large number of older patients. Over 200,000 older women develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer each year. We will examine whether the symptoms patients have even prior to treatments are related to completing five years of necessary estrogen-blocking breast cancer medications. This study will provide new information about whether preexisting symptoms and/or other factors are important barriers to patients, information that is essential to developing new ways to support patients in taking their medications.",Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women,10261485,R21AG064875,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Aromatase Inhibitors', 'Arthralgia', 'Attention', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer therapy', 'Cancer Center', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Estrogens', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Observational Study', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Tamoxifen', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Thermometers', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Vasomotor', 'Woman', 'adjuvant endocrine therapy', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'older patient', 'older women', 'pill', 'poor sleep', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'regression trees', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor']",NIA,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2021,195000
"Long noncoding RNA regulations in breast cancer among African-American women ABSTRACT Breast cancer rates among African-American (AA) women continue to rise and may further widen breast cancer disparities experienced by AA women, who are more likely to develop aggressive tumor types with a worse prognosis. The biological reasons for these differences remain largely unknown. Recent genome-wide, high-throughput studies highlight an emerging role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as a novel class of regulatory molecules in cancer. LncRNAs form an important regulatory layer in global gene expression, and increasing evidence indicates that abnormal expression of specific lncRNAs can contribute to breast cancer carcinogenesis and progression. Studies to date, however, are focused exclusively on EA women, have not commonly used high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) to provide unbiased comprehensive profiling, and mostly do not incorporate rigorous normal tissue controls. Motivated by these research gaps and limitations, we recently completed a pilot study of genome-wide lncRNA expression profiling in normal and tumor breast tissues from AA and EA women. LncRNA expression data showed clear tissue- and subtype- specific expression patterns. Importantly, we noted a number of differentially abundant lncRNAs between AA and EA women by estrogen receptor (ER) status. These results indicate that there are unique lncRNA expression patterns in AA tumors, which we hypothesize contributes to aggressive tumor biology and high breast cancer-related mortality. We propose a cost-effective study in a well-characterized cohort of AA breast cancer patients in the Women’s Circle of Health Study (WCHS), which has available tumor tissue blocks, and extensive data on tumor characteristics, clinical outcomes, treatments received, lifestyle factors, and genome- wide DNA methylation. As such, our Specific Aims are: 1) Perform tissue lncRNA expression profiling using total RNA sequencing (1181 AA cases from WCHS and 100 AA controls from Komen Tissue Bank) to determine lncRNAs that are breast cancer- and ER subtype- specific (tumor, ER+, ER- vs. normal) and those associated with clinico-pathological factors (e.g., grade); 2) Examine associations of lncRNA expression levels with breast cancer survival, and use a machine learning approach to identify a combined panel of lncRNAs associated with breast cancer survival; and further perform computational prediction and in vitro functional assays to determine their biological relevance; and 3) Integrate paired data on lncRNA expression and DNA methylation to determine which of these cancer- and prognosis-relevant lncRNAs are regulated by DNA methylation, and explore whether diet, obesity and other lifestyle-related factors are associated with aberrant DNA methylation. This work is novel and findings are anticipated to advance our understanding of molecular mechanisms contributing to aggressive tumor biology and poor cancer prognosis observed in AA women that can be translated into the development of targeted strategies for prevention and therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) African American (AA) women have a higher risk of being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer and have the highest mortality rate among all racial groups in U.S. women. We will systematically elucidate the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a novel class of regulatory molecules, in breast cancer prognosis in AA women.

"Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent among breast cancer survivors. This is due to shared risk factors between CVD and cancer, but also that breast cancer therapies are often cardiotoxic, which may later cause heart failure (HF). Cardiotoxicity from breast cancer chemotherapy affects between 10-20% of patients with enhanced risk in the presence of traditional CVD risk factors. However, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of cardiotoxicity among the rapidly growing population of young and emerging adult (YEA) breast cancer survivors, which comprise 5-12% of all breast cancer diagnoses. As survival from breast cancer increases, exposure to cardiotoxic chemotherapies at a younger age may enhance HF risk among YEA breast cancer survivors. Moreover, YEA breast cancer patients are more likely to have gene mutations that may also impair cardiac tissue function combined with a unique pattern of health behaviors and CVD risk factors. However, we are currently unable to predict which patients are at highest risk of cardiotoxicity. Studies suggest that gene expression may refine identification of women at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. To date, no studies examined whether combining gene expression and genetic mutations with CVD risk factors can identify YEA patients at increased risk of cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapy. To address this issue, I will complete the following specific aims: 1) Develop a predictive model combining psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors to identify YEA breast cancer patients at increased risk of cardiotoxicity as defined by a decline in global longitudinal strain (GLS) or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); 2) Investigate if the risk factor profile at diagnosis is associated with trajectory of GLS and LVEF during and after breast cancer treatment; and 3) investigate the impact of molecular biomarkers to risk prediction models. We will recruit a longitudinal cohort of n=300 YEA breast cancer patients treated at Northwestern Medicine. Among these participants, in a nested case-control design, we will select cases diagnosed with decline in GLS during chemotherapy (n=50) with age-matched controls without cardiotoxicity (n=50). For all participants, we will combine electronic health record (EHR) data with psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors at three timepoints. For the nested case-control study, we will additionally measure gene expression at two timepoints. This directly informs my short-term career development goals to 1) Gain experience in HF and CVD etiology, epidemiology, and risk factors; 2) Develop skills in machine learning and bioinformatics approaches for prediction; and 3) Refine health informatics methods to integrate EHR with epidemiologic and molecular data. The skills and pilot data generated through this K01 will enable me to address the NHLBI compelling question (5.CQ.10) to reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors. I will thus achieve my long-term career goal to identify and intervene on the CVD threats to the health and longevity of YEA cancer survivors. Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among women globally, while cardiovascular disease has become a leading cause of death among breast cancer survivors. Commonly used breast cancer treatments are known to cause cardiotoxicity, but the majority of studies have not examined the growing population of young and emerging adult breast cancer patients. The objective of this study is to develop a personalized model of psychosocial factors, traditional CVD risk factors, and molecular markers that predicts risk of cardiotoxicity among YEA breast cancer patients.",Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship,10159953,K01HL152009,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Breast Cancer therapy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast cancer survival', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cardiogenesis', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'chemotherapy', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical care', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'modifiable risk', 'molecular marker', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'social', 'survivorship', 'young adult', 'young cancer survivor']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2021,156336
"Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone ABSTRACT Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women and is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, with 1.6 million new cases and 500,000 BC deaths annually. Patients diagnosed in low- resource settings (LRS) account for half of new cases, and the majority of deaths from BC worldwide. The first critical step to starting life-saving treatment for BC is the accurate and timely pathologic confirmation of a cancer diagnosis, a task which remains challenging in many LRS. Traditional pathology assessment involves processing surgically excised specimens with cell-block methods for: (1) cellular histopathology, which identifies abnormal cellular morphologies indicative of malignancy, and (2) molecular pathology, which identifies tumor biomarkers, specifically estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and the proliferation maker Ki67. Breast cancer subtyping using these markers is essential for determining prognosis, as well as for selecting subtype-specific therapies. Unfortunately, histology-based pathology services require a strong pathology infrastructure and trained pathologists, limiting access to these services in many LRS. For example, there are only 15 trained pathologists in Tanzania, a country of over 55 million people. There is hence an urgent need for new methods to accurately diagnose cancer, as well as to analyze expression levels of molecular biomarkers for tumor subtyping. A technology driven solution that could automate cellular pathology with minimal user-intervention and virtually no infrastructure requirements could thus enormously impact the management of breast cancer in LRS. Motivated by this need, the objective of this proposal is to finalize the development of the EpiView-D4 point-of-care test (POCT) to analyze both the cellular and molecular features of breast cancer from needle aspiration specimens. The EpiView component of the device enables easily accessible, low-cost, smart-phone based brightfield cellular imaging of fine needle aspirate breast biopsies without the need for pathologist assessment. In parallel, the D4 POCT component of the device images a point-of-care antibody microarray for the quantification of ER/PR/Her2/Ki67 levels from breast FNA lysate with picomolar sensitivity within 30 minutes at point-of-care, eliminating the need for additional visits before a treatment plan can be initiated. The EpiView-D4 will enable automated readout of both cytopathology and the molecular profiles of breast cancer, using machine learning algorithms integrated into a smartphone application. In this proposal, we will conduct final device development and training of ML algorithms, followed by pre-clinical validation and clinical investigation of the Epiview-D4 POCT, first at Duke University Medical Center, and then in the intended LRS of Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center. The impact of this technology lies in its potential to dramatically improve breast cancer management worldwide by enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis and subtyping of breast cancers, thereby driving timely and appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients and hence improving the outcomes for hundreds of thousands of women with BC annually in LRS. PROJECT NARRATIVE In less developed parts of the world, there is an urgent need for accurate and more informative diagnosis of breast cancer as trained pathologists are scarce‚ and pathology infrastructure is often very limited. The proposed research will complete the currently ongoing development of a cell-phone based device that: (1) images cells from breast tumors and analyzes them by software to identify whether a person has breast cancer, and (2) measures levels of clinically-relevant protein biomarkers to help guide treatment. If successful, this technology can be widely by health care workers to provide the same level of care in low-resource settings as is currently available in the US and will thereby save many lives.",Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone,10115009,R01CA248491,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Core Biopsy', 'Country', 'Cytology', 'Cytopathology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunodiagnostics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Needles', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Progesterone Receptors', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Specimen', 'Tanzania', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast cancer survival', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer subtypes', 'cellular imaging', 'cellular pathology', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud platform', 'cost', 'data repository', 'disorder subtype', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'molecular marker', 'molecular pathology', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'protein biomarkers', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'subtype-specific therapies', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,607659
"3D Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging for Cancer Detection and Treatment Monitoring PROJECT SUMMARY Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, which is a major clinical issue. Access to inexpensive and noninvasive methods to determine early treatment response are essential to determine if a chosen anticancer therapeutic regimen is efficacious. Tumor angiogenesis is a key biomarker of breast cancer growth and metastasis. This tumor microvascularity is known to exhibit distinct perfusion characteristics and morphologic features during the early stages of breast tumor development which fundamentally change during a positive response to neoadjuvant treatment. The overarching goal of this research project is to develop an innovative three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (SR-US) imaging system and new image processing solutions to considerably improve our ability to perform in vivo quantitative analysis of tumor angiogenic networks. The first aim of this project involves optimization of 3D SR-US imaging functionality on a programmable US scanner equipped with a custom 1024-element (32 x 32) matrix array transducer. The second aim involves the development of new open-source SR-US image processing software for performing motion correction and quantitative analysis of tumor perfusion and microvascular morphology features in 3D space. In the third aim, we will evaluate the use of angiogenic biomarkers extracted from 3D SR- US images as a quantitative basis for distinguishing healthy from diseased tissue volumes in a transgenic animal model of breast cancer. We will also assess the use of in vivo 3D SR-US imaging for detection of early tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment using the same animal model.

"Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus Project Summary The ultimate goal of this research is to define the mechanisms through which specific endocrine and genetic risk factors contribute to breast cancer development. The focus of this proposed study is Emca4, a genetic determinant of susceptibility to 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer in the rat that has been mapped to rat chromosome 7 (RNO7). Data presented herein indicate that Emca4 harbors multiple genetic determinants of mammary cancer susceptibility that are orthologous to breast cancer risk loci mapped to chromosome 8q24.21. Also presented are novel data that indicate that a risk prediction model based on genotype across the Emca4 orthologous regions in the human genome can accurately distinguish cases from controls in a previously characterized case/control cohort. The primary objectives of this proposed study are to identify the cell types in which and the mechanisms through which the Emca4 variants influence development of mammary cancer. The knowledge gained will be translate to studies of human derived biospecimens to assess relevance of the data emerging from the rat models. Aim 1 is to define the mechanisms through which Emca4.1 determines susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancer. The genes upon which the Emca4.1 variants act will be identified in defined mammary cell populations. Aim 2 is to define the mechanism through which Emca4.4 influences mammary cancer susceptibility and modifies the actions of Emca4.1. The molecular bases of the epistatic interactions between Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 on mammary cancer susceptibility and the cellular and molecular phenotypes regulated by Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 will be defined. Specific Aim 3 is to define the function(s) of Pvt1 in the rat mammary gland and its role in mammary cancer development. Attention will be focused on functionally characterizing Pvt1 promoters and exons that are impacted by endocrine and genetic factors or differ between matched normal and neoplastic mammary/breast tissues. Novel, physiologically relevant, rat models of E2-induced mammary cancer will be utilized in this research. Successful completion of the proposed studies proposed is expected to identify the cell types in which the actions of the Emca4 variants on mammary cancer susceptibility are exerted, the specific gene product(s) that confers the actions of the Emca4 variants in those cell types, and the downstream biological processes that are influenced by the functional orthologs that reside within Emca4. The information generated in these studies is expected to advance our understanding of the etiology of the luminal breast cancer subtypes. Relevance to public health: This proposed research utilizes novel and physiologically relevant rat models of 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer to define the mechanisms and sites of action of “functional orthologs” that reside within the Emca4 mammary cancer susceptibility locus in rat and the genetically orthologous 8q24 breast cancer risk locus in humans. By genetically linking the Emca4/8q24 functional orthologs to the biological processes that influence development of E2-induced mammary cancer, these studies will enhance our knowledge of how genetic and endocrine factors interact to influence normal mammary gland biology and mammary cancer susceptibility and will lay the foundation for development of novel strategies for breast cancer risk prediction and prevention.","Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus",10112098,R01CA204320,"['8q24', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'Chromosome 7', 'Chromosomes', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endocrine', 'Epidemiology', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Chromosomes', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mammary gland', 'Maps', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Oncoproteins', 'Orthologous Gene', 'PVT1 gene', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer subtypes', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'cohort', 'experimental study', 'gene product', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular phenotype', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'rat genome', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,418643
"Population-Targeted Risk Prediction to Guide Breast Cancer Screening in Cameroon Project Summary/Abstract: As cancer becomes an increasingly important cause of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, nations must improve their capacity to diagnose and treat the malignancies that most affect their populations. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality for women in Cameroon, where two thirds of patients present with stage III or IV disease, and five-year survival rates are less than 30%. A longstanding collaboration between the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the University of Buea, and the University of California, Los Angeles (the MBLA partnership) plans to conduct key stakeholder interviews in order to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a breast cancer screening program that is initially offered to high-risk women. Risk-based screening aims to equitably target early screening efforts while ensuring that diagnostic and treatment capacity are sufficient to manage lesions identified through screening. Such a program requires a breast cancer risk prediction model that is applicable and acceptable to Cameroonian women and feasible to evaluate through a community-based screening program. Studies in the United States, Asia, and Nigeria demonstrate that breast cancer risk prediction models perform best when they are ethnic group-specific, but no breast cancer risk prediction model has been developed for Cameroonian women. The African Breast Cancer case-control Study (ABCS) contains breast cancer risk factor information for women from Nigeria, Uganda, and a small subset of women from Cameroon. Traditional approaches to risk prediction will likely suffer from small sample size in models trained on Cameroon data only or from bias in models trained and validated on the full, ethnically diverse dataset. In Aim 1, a subgroup-specific cross-validation method will be incorporated into the Super Learner ensemble prediction algorithm to develop a breast cancer risk prediction model that incorporates all ABCS data but is optimized for Cameroonian women. Aim 2 addresses MBLA members’ concerns that certain risk factors from ABCS will be difficult to evaluate by community survey. Targeted learning methods will be used to define metrics for comparing risk prediction models including and excluding these variables so that Cameroonian stakeholders can evaluate whether to include these risk factors in their breast cancer risk prediction model. In Aim 3, an R shiny app will be developed, tested, and optimized in order to facilitate use of a Cameroon-specific breast cancer risk model in a future screening program. The methods developed and tested in this project could help to optimize cancer risk prediction models for other ethnic groups with limited data in sub-Saharan Africa and globally. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of the MBLA collaboration, UC Berkeley’s leaders in the field of targeted learning, and the UCSF Global Cancer Program. By providing protected time for training, research, and career development, this grant will facilitate the applicant’s progress towards becoming a breast surgical oncologist researching methods of improving access to cancer care in Africa. Project Narrative: In response to rising rates of breast cancer in Cameroon, a partnership between the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the University of Buea, and the University of California, Los Angeles plans to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a risk-based breast cancer screening program in Cameroon. This project aims to develop a method for defining a breast cancer risk prediction model optimized for Cameroonian women that makes use of information from a large, ethnically diverse case-control dataset and to provide Cameroonian stakeholders with information needed to select which risk factors to include in a Cameroon- specific breast cancer risk model.

"Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating tumor cell aggregation Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) pose continuous and persistent threats to create new metastases albeit at an unknown, extremely low efficiency. Compared to single CTCs, clusters of multicellular CTCs possess 20-100 times higher metastatic capacity, create more polyclonal metastasis, and correlate with worse prognosis. Our previous studies identified that in addition to collective migration and cohesive shedding, tumor cell aggregation is a new mechanism for CTC cluster formation, enhancing cancer stemness and polyclonal metastasis. The objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CD44 and PAK2-promoted CTC aggregation, identify the drivers of CTC cluster-mediated polyclonal metastasis, and therefore develop proof-of-principle targeting strategies to block lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancer, using multiple human PDXs and CTC lines as well as mouse tumor models. The collaborative team includes Dr. Huiping Liu (Northwestern University) with expertise in CTC and cancer stemness, breast oncologist Dr. Massimo Cristofanilli (Northwestern University), imaging expert Dr. Constadina Arvanitis (Northwestern University), and bioinformaticist and structural biologist Dr. Yang Shen (Texas A & M). Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women and claims about 40,000 lives in the United States every year. Metastasis account for 90% of breast cancer deaths. In order to develop effective treatments against cancer, we need to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying metastasis. Using clinical specimens, patient-derived xenograft models, and other cell line and models along with cutting-edge technology, this project aims to identify a novel mechanism critical for circulating tumor cell cluster formation and targeting strategies to block metastasis, thereby eventually contributing to a reduced mortality rate of breast cancer.",Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating tumor cell aggregation,10143213,R01CA245699,"['4T1', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breast', 'Breast Oncology', 'Breast cancer metastasis', 'CD44 gene', 'CDKN1A gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Down-Regulation', 'Extracellular Domain', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'MDA MB 231', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mammospheres', 'Mediating', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Structural Biologist', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yang', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cohesion', 'effective therapy', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'lung colonization', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'member', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stemness', 'therapeutic development', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'tumorigenic']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,440017
"Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to assess the impact of built environments on changes in BMI, physical activity and cancer-related biomarkers in two successful weight loss interventions in women at In 2018, 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected. The Breast Cancer and Environment Research Program, funded by NIEHS and NCI, identified a need to better understand environmental exposures to inform cancer prevention efforts. Further, Just in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) employ temporal and spatial cues to prompt behavior change, but little is known about spatial predictors of behaviors at the minute level and beyond home neighborhoods. Two successful weight loss trials in women at risk for breast cancer, conducted in harmony under the NCI-funded Transdisciplinary Research and Energetics in Cancer Center, offer a unique opportunity to examine the health impacts of changing environmental exposures in a heterogeneous sample. One trial focused on older breast cancer survivors, the other on women across the age range at increased breast cancer risk due to their obesity status. The studies included numerous identical measures at baseline and 6 months, including biomarkers, GPS and accelerometer measurements, and perceived environment surveys. We propose to investigate the relationship between minute level objective GIS measured walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments and changes in BMI, physical activity (PA), and cancer related biomarkers. Few studies have assessed the impact of the built environment on weight loss interventions using objective daily measures, and none included biomarkers of cancer risk. Further, no studies have employed novel GPS measures of total environment exposure that can change as behaviors change in an intervention. Assessing the effects of built environments on intervention outcomes and investigating changes in exposure over time will provide more causal evidence to inform the policy agenda. Most data on built environment and health are cross sectional. We need longitudinal, causal evidence to support policy changes in urban design that will have lasting impact on large population groups and those at risk, recommended by the WHO, IOM and CDC. In addition, we will use estimates of exposure change from the current study to simulate the potential impact of JITAIs and to identify decision points, decision rules and tailoring variables for future interventions. The current study will geocode each GPS coordinate (42 million), integrate built environment data on walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments in GIS using validated integrated data analysis techniques, and investigate whether the environment influences changes in biomarkers, BMI and PA. The Ecological model posits that factors at the individual, interpersonal, and community level can influence behavior and health. These analyses will assess the multi-level predictors, while adjusting for interpersonal and individual covariates. Results will be disseminated to existing community partners from cancer, aging and transportation planning to inform local advocacy efforts. This study will also inform future RCTs controlling for individual and environmental predictors at baseline and inform JITAIs by developing and testing minute level spatial, temporal and behavioral rules. Women in two weight loss interventions changed their behavior overtime. We will assess how the environment around them may have affected their behaviors to inform future studies that use spatial cues to prompt behavior change.","Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to assess the impact of built environments on changes in BMI, physical activity and cancer-related biomarkers in two successful weight loss interventions in women at",10112839,R01CA228147,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air Pollution', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Businesses', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Vitamin D', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'active lifestyle', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior influence', 'built environment', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'connected care', 'demographics', 'design', 'environmental change', 'food environment', 'frailty', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'intervention participants', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'remote location', 'social media', 'unsupervised learning', 'walkability', 'weight loss intervention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,549222
"Do Tumor-Immune Interactions Prime Systemic Tolerance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain Metastases? PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY It is widely estimated that 90% of cancer-related deaths are caused by metastasis. This statistic underscores our inability to manage cancer once it disseminates through the body, and our need to better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive metastasis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that occurs in 10-20% of cases. Taken as a group, TNBCs pose an unmet clinical challenge in many ways: (1) TNBCs represents the most aggressive and most metastatic subtype of breast cancer, (2) up to 46% of late-stage TNBC patients will develop brain metastases, (3) TNBC patients are at four-times higher risk of developing diffuse metastases on the surface of the brain (leptomeningeal disease), which is rapidly and universally fatal, and 4) women of African ancestry have an up to 80% higher likelihood of developing TNBC – making TNBC a cancer disparity. Previous studies demonstrate that primary TNBC is highly immunogenic, and immune infiltration is associated with improved prognosis. However, little is known about the immune environment in TNBC brain metastases and how tumor-immune interactions effect metastatic potential. Recognizing these pressing issues, I have chosen to focus my career as an independent cancer researcher on using a systems biology approach to uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie metastasis and race- specific cancer disparities. A comprehensive mentoring, research, and career development plan will be executed over the course of the K99 and R00 training period, which will provide me with the necessary tools to make an early transition to independence. First, to visualize tumor-immune interactions, I will construct an in-situ protein map of TNBC brain metastases using MIBI – a cutting-edge multiplexed imaging method (AIM 1). I will use a validated imaging analysis pipeline to quantitate the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor-immune microenvironment and determine the extent to which these features correlate with patient outcomes. In AIM 2, I will identify tumor-immune receptor-ligand pairs using single-cell RNA-sequencing on TNBC brain metastases samples. Lastly, in AIM 3, I will use MIBI to visualize tumor-immune interactions in primary TNBCs to determine whether interactions in the primary tumor microenvironment prime immune system tolerance of disseminated tumor cells enabling brain metastases. I will validate relevant targets by measuring their expression in patient cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), which contains brain-tumor- associated cell-free RNA. The results of my proposed postdoctoral research will positively impact public health as they will reveal key tumor-immune interactions responsible for priming the immune system for metastasis, and will generate the first “TNBC brain metastasis interactome”. My results will lead to the discovery of new molecular targets with the primary goal of reducing metastasis-driven cancer mortality. The K99 career development plan and focused research training will be critical to expand my skillset in biocomputation – a necessary component of my proposed research; as well as fill any gaps in my background, preparing me for a timely and successful transition to the R00 independent phase. Overall, the dual-phase award will significantly enhance my research, and ensure my continued contribution to public health and increasing diversity in science, as an established cancer researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE It is estimated that metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer deaths, with 1 in every 2 advanced staged triple-negative breast cancer patients developing brain metastases – surviving as little as 4.9 months after metastatic diagnosis. This work postulates that the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment reflects distinct tumor-immune interactions that are driven by receptor-ligand pairing; and that these interactions not only impact tumor progression in the brain, but also prime the immune system (early on) to be tolerant of disseminated cancer cells permitting brain metastases. The main goal of this work is to build a model that recapitulates tumor-immune interactions in brain-metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and use this model to identify novel druggable targets to improve survival outcomes in patients with devastating brain metastases.",Do Tumor-Immune Interactions Prime Systemic Tolerance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain Metastases?,10115537,K99CA256522,"['Advisory Committees', 'African', 'African American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Infiltration', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer health disparity', 'career', 'career development', 'data integration', 'differential expression', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'imaging modality', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'survival outcome', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,162617
"Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients The EGFR-MAPK pathway is a key signaling pathway in human Triple Negative Beast Cancers (TNBC). We propose to leverage genomic and proteomic data from a rich animal model system, and 2 human clinical trials, to build predictive models of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway activity for TNBC patients. The heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered previous development of predictive pathway-based computational models because most approaches are based on experimental data from a single cell line or animal model that is then extrapolated to fit multiple tumor subtypes. Our approach is to use a diverse experimental model system that reflects the heterogeneous disease subtypes, and then use two distinct and complementary methods to build the computational model. We will simultaneously use mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches, at a variety of scales, that incorporate data from drug treated tumors and cell lines, assayed for gene expression, DNA copy number, DNA mutations, and protein kinome activity. Lastly, we will test these computational models on human tumors to evaluate their predictive performance. Project Narrative Breast cancer is not one disease, but instead, represents multiple diseases. Each of these unique subtypes requires a different therapeutic approach, thus, determining which new drugs will benefit each disease subtype is critical. To address this need, we are focusing on one of the most therapeutically difficult to treat breast cancer subtypes, namely Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC). We also propose to develop a mathematical representation of a key growth regulating pathway (i.e. EGFR-MAPK) that will predict its activity in TNBC patients, and thus could be used to guide therapies to those patients who have this pathway active within their tumors. We will ultimately test our predictive model on human tumors coming from clinical trials, and if successful, we will have developed a new biomarker for guiding TNBC patient treatments through the use of objective mathematical models",Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,10140308,U01CA238475,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'Erlotinib', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Inbred BALB C Mice', 'Individual', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'MAPK Signaling Pathway Pathway', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Normal Cell', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell growth', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning network', 'mRNA sequencing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neoplastic cell', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'treatment strategy', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2021,572275
"The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells and Estrogen Receptor Expression in Racial Disparities in Breast Cancer Biology. ABSTRACT: African-American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European-American (EA) women. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying this disparity is a critical unmet need with major public health implications. The tumor immune milieu may play a pivotal role in breast cancer disparities, specifically tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that have roles in oncogenesis and disease progression. Using H&E stained slides from a large epidemiological case-control study, we have discovered that AA women have significantly higher levels of TILs than EA women – especially in the estrogen receptor (ER) negative subgroups. This indicates a distinct biological difference in the tumor immune response related to race and ER status, and also presents a conundrum in which TILs that are often associated with better outcome are higher in AA women, who typically fare worse with breast cancer. These findings indicate that the specific composition of immune cell populations and their spatial arrangement within the tumor environment are likely to be important mitigating factors for the role of TILs in breast cancer progression, and tumor differences between AA and EA women. Our preliminary data from the NanoString PanCancer Immune Panel support this idea by revealing that AA women have gene expression signatures indicative of higher levels of exhausted T cells than EA women, which have a diminished capacity to destroy tumor cells, consistent with the poorer survival observed in AA women. Here, immune gene expression profiles also varied by ER status, pointing to a potential immunoregulatory role of ER in breast cancer.  To date, most studies that examine TILs do so in cohorts of predominantly EA women and in-depth immune profiling studies in large cohorts of AA women are lacking. To address this shortcoming, we will employ multispectral staining and imaging with the Vectra® Quantitative Pathology System to delineate immune cell populations and ER expression in 996 breast cancer samples from the Women's Circle of Health Study. Building on our preliminary data, we propose to evaluate two immunofluorescence panels, each with multiple biomarkers in their spatio-morphological context. While both panels will include ER and a differentiating cytokeratin marker, panel 1 will include four common T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3), and panel 2 will include markers of T cell exhaustion (TIGIT, LAG3, PD-1) that may play a key role in the differential immune response between AA and EA women. Our proposal involves the full implementation of a new generation of biomarker assessment techniques – multiplexed staining, multispectral imaging, automated scoring, and digital spatial analyses. A thorough comparison of the immune landscape in breast tumors in regards to race and ER expression will inform our understanding of immune escape mechanisms, and how these processes differ by ancestry. This will be critical for designing immunotherapy strategies that will equally benefit AA women, serving to reduce racial disparities in breast cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-American women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European- American women and this may be due to biological differences in their tumor immune cells. We will use a sophisticated tumor tissue staining and imaging approach to evaluate the immune cells in breast cancer samples from a large group of predominantly African-American women. Our findings will inform on the abundance and types of immune cells present in breast tumors and may improve cancer immunotherapy strategies for African-American women.",The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells and Estrogen Receptor Expression in Racial Disparities in Breast Cancer Biology.,10058825,R03CA238792,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'American', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Cytokeratin', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Estrogen Receptor Status', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Estrogen receptor negative', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Estrogens', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Slide', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Space Perception', 'Stains', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissue imaging', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Woman', 'biomarker panel', 'breast cancer progression', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'liquid crystal polymer', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'nano-string', 'neoplastic cell', 'pathology imaging', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'racial disparity', 'receptor expression', 'spatial relationship', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R03,2021,87350
"Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This proposal presents a five-year career development plan focused on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) and the application of AI to improve outcomes in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The candidate is a Radiologist at MGH and an Assistant Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. The proposal builds upon the candidate’s previous research and clinical experiences in breast imaging and also upon a strong ongoing research partnership between MGH and MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The candidate’s long-term career goal is to become a leader in academic breast imaging by investigating and applying AI to critical areas in breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The proposed research project and advanced didactic training at Harvard and MIT will position the candidate with a unique set of knowledge and skills in data science and AI that will enable her to develop an independent cancer research program that focuses on applications of AI to breast imaging.  The incidence of DCIS has dramatically increased over the past 40 years, with an estimated 63,960 diagnoses in 2018. Current guidelines recommend that DCIS be treated with surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy, but there remains considerable controversy over whether this regimen represents overtreatment for those women with indolent non-hazardous DCIS. Given concerns about overtreatment, there are currently three randomized controlled trials underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of active surveillance versus standard treatment, and critical to the implementation of active surveillance programs is careful selection of eligible patients. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust AI tool that incorporates clinical data, mammographic imaging, and biopsy histopathology slides for pre-operatively predicting the risk of concurrent invasive cancer in women with DCIS. The tool will be built using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Incorporation of mammographic imaging and histopathology slides into the AI tool will be supported by the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS) and the MGH Department of Pathology. After development and validation of the AI tool based on a retrospective cohort of 1,400 women diagnosed with DCIS at MGH, the tool will then be integrated into MGH’s mammography information system and used to categorize new cases of DCIS. The specific aims are: (1) to develop a robust AI tool that predicts the risk of upgrade of DCIS diagnosed by image-guided core needle biopsy to invasive cancer at surgery and (2) to implement and evaluate the AI tool in clinical practice. Use of this tool could identify the subset of women who are appropriate candidates for active surveillance, decrease the morbidity and costs of overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, more than 60,000 women are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is also known as noninvasive or Stage 0 breast cancer, and undergo an aggressive treatment regimen involving surgery, radiation, and hormonal therapy. We propose to develop and implement a robust tool, using artificial intelligence, to pre-operatively predict the risk that DCIS will upgrade to invasive cancer at surgery. Development of a highly reliable prognostic tool could identify the subset of women who may not need aggressive treatment, decrease the morbidity and costs associated with overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS.",Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ,10206069,K08CA241365,"['Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Histopathology', 'Hormone Receptor', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Indolent', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Mammographic Density', 'Mammography', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Slide', 'Surveillance Program', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cancer invasiveness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'complex data', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'hormone therapy', 'image guided', 'improved outcome', 'intelligent algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical schools', 'overtreatment', 'patient health information', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'professor', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'risk stratification', 'skills', 'standard care', 'surgery outcome', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2021,260112
"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls. By introducing this newly emerged powerful machine learning technique to the clinical side of breast cancer screening, it will contribute to improving personal breast cancer risk prediction and reducing unnecessary recalls.

"The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health disparities Women of African heritage suffer a higher breast cancer mortality compared to their European counterparts. Though the biologic basis for these disparities remains poorly defined, recent studies suggest definitive roles for biological variation in the gene expression pathways governing tumor behavior and alterations in the tumor microenvironment. The transcription factor Kaiso (ZBTB33) is a gene regulatory factor, found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of breast cancer cells, that has been functionally linked to racial differences in survival outcome in several epithelial cancers. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to define functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the immmune tumor microenvironment that contribute to racial differences in breast cancer survival. We accomplish this through application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to characterize the Kaiso dependent differences in spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment using multiplex immunofluorescent technologies to profile a unique breast cancer health disparities cohort (Specific Aim One). We then apply this technology to examine the impact of Kaiso disruption on autophagy and the immune tumor microenvironment using a murine orthotopic allograft model for Kaiso depletion in the presence and absence of pharmacologic blockade of autophagy (Specific Aim Two). We then perform a large-scale application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to profile the spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment in 901 racially diverse breast cancer specimens by multiplex immunohistochemistry to define the detailed role of Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment in population-specific differences in breast cancer outcome (Specific Aim Three). Together with a closely integrated multi-disciplinary team of breast cancer pathologists, cancer biologists, computer scientists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticians and data scientists, we will define new prognostic and predictive biomarkers that link Kaiso to tumor progression, the immune tumor microenvironment, breast cancer outcome and how their association differs by race. Elevated expression of the multifunctional transcriptional regulator, Kaiso (ZBTB33) is associated with worse breast cancer survival based on race. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to study a novel breast cancer health disparities cohort to define new functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment that contribute to racially disparate breast cancer outcome.","The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health disparities",10269010,R01CA253368,"['African', 'Allografting', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Computers', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Histopathology', 'Hormone Receptor', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppression', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Race', 'Recurrence Score', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Slide', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Specimen', 'Technology', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Biology', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast cancer progression', 'breast cancer survival', 'cancer health disparity', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disparity reduction', 'health disparity', 'hormone receptor-negative', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'improved', 'inhibition of autophagy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'response', 'survival outcome', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,617044
"Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY Screening mammography saves lives but human interpretation alone is imperfect and is associated with significant harms including ~30,000 missed breast cancers and ~3.8 million false-positives exams each year in the U.S. alone. Traditional computer-aided detection failed to improve screening accuracy, in part due to the static nature of software trained and tested on small datasets decades ago. Recent advances in improved computer processing power, cloud-based data storage capabilities, and availability of large imaging datasets have led to renewed excitement for applying artificial intelligence (AI) to mammography interpretation. We propose a unique academic-industry partnership to validate, refine, scale, and clinically translate our proven 2D mammography AI algorithm to 3D mammography interpretation. Our team helped organize and lead the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) Digital Mammography Challenge, an open crowdsourced AI algorithmic challenge that provided >640,000 digital 2D mammogram images and associated clinical metadata to >1,200 coding teams worldwide. Our industry partner for this grant, DeepHealth, Inc., was the top performing team in the DREAM Challenge. With >50% of U.S. facilities now offering 3D mammography for screening, the 50-to-100-fold increase in imaging data represents a new critical barrier for both radiologists and AI algorithm developers. To date, there have been few publications addressing AI-enhanced interpretation of 3D mammography, the emerging screening exam of choice. We will validate our post-DREAM algorithm for 2D mammography (which currently rivals human interpretation alone) using UCLA's Athena Breast Health Network, one of the largest population-based breast imaging registries. We will enhance our 2D AI algorithm with expert radiologist supervision and examine the impact of adding novel non-imaging data parameters, including genetic mutation and tumor molecular subtype data, to help train the AI model to identify more clinically significant cancers. We will use several novel technical algorithmic approaches to scale from 2D to 3D mammography which, in our preliminary studies, have shown improved accuracy beyond radiologist interpretation alone. Finally, we will perform a series of interpretive studies to identify the optimal interface between “black box” outputs and radiologist interpreters, which remains an understudied topic. With >40 million U.S. women undergoing screening each year, seemingly small improvements in overall accuracy would still imply significantly improved population-based outcomes. In summary, we have assembled an unparalleled multidisciplinary team with expertise in machine/deep learning, breast cancer screening accuracy, medicine, oncology, radiology, imaging technology assessment, and biostatistics. We have a proven track record of strong collaboration and are well positioned to validate, enhance, scale, and translate our proven 2D AI algorithm for improved 3D mammography accuracy. Our new end user tool will help tip the balance of routine screening towards greater benefits than harms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current interpretation of screening mammography suffers from human limitations, leading to approximately 30,000 missed cancers and 3.8 million false positives exams every year in the U.S. alone. Our multidisciplinary team of experts on breast cancer screening, machine and deep learning, data science, and imaging technology assessment will validate our highly accurate 2D mammography artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that was the best performer in an international competition with >1,200 participants and then further enhance it with novel AI augmentation methods. We will then apply innovative techniques to scale the AI algorithm from 2D to 3D mammography, addressing the issue of a 50-to-100-fold increase in volumetric data with 3D exams, and then clinically translate our optimized AI 3D mammography tool through a series of interpretive accuracy studies involving experienced and inexperienced radiologists from both academic and community practices.","Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation",10075243,R37CA240403,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Community Practice', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Institution', 'International', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publications', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'algorithm development', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'computer aided detection', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'long short term memory', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prospective', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R37,2021,528811
"Machine learning for risk-adjusted breast MRI screening SUMMARY Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging modality for breast cancer diagnosis to date. Women with a strong family history or related genetic mutations have an elevated risk of breast cancer and are recommended to participate in yearly MRI screenings. However, the rate of detection in this high-risk cohort is small, prompting a desire to reduce unnecessary MRI exams. The basic hypothesis of this project is that within the screening cohort the individual risk of a future cancer can be estimated based on the appearance of breast MRI and mammograms today. In preliminary work we have already identified low-risk women that could have omitted a screening session without missing a new cancer. The discovery of this lower-risk subgroup was made possible by modern deep-learning tools developed in preliminary work. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) has accrued a database of approximately 70,000 breast MRI exams over 18 years along with the patients’ clinical outcomes. This unprecedented resource enables the training of modern machine learning “from the ground-up” to extract and classify volumetric MRI features. The specific aims of this project are as follows. Aim 1 (Data curation): Systematic analysis of the large dataset accrued at MSK requires careful curation including image content, image quality, pathology results, clinical follow-up, as well as demographic and genomic information. The outcome of this Aim is a curated dataset that can broadly benefit future technical efforts in breast diagnosis. Aim 2 (Deep learning): To make risk stratification quantitative we propose to analyze the MRI scans using modern deep networks that have been trained to identify the location and extent of a cancer. We will then transfer the MRI features of these trained networks as well as networks trained on mammograms to the task of diagnosis and risk assessment. The intended outcome of this Aim are predictive models with human-level performance at diagnosis and segmentation. Aim 3 (Risk adjusted screening): To reduce the burden of screening while maintaining sensitivity we will estimate the risk of finding a malignant tumor in the future, based on the present MRI exam and most recent mammogram as well as patient information. The machine-estimated risk will be used in a retrospective analysis to determine the primary outcome, namely, the number of exams that could have been omitted by scheduling a longer screening interval without compromising sensitivity. This will be repeated on newly accrued data at MSK, Duke and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) as secondary sites. Once validated, the risk-prediction model will be publicly released to encourage data sharing and clinical adoption. The preliminary work performed over the last two years has brought together a unique interdisciplinary team including clinical investigators on breast MRI at MSK, and machine-learning and medical imaging experts at CCNY, Duke and JHU. The platform technology that will be developed here is applicable beyond breast cancer, and the transfer learning approach applicable in particular to cancers with more limited datasets. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to detect breast cancer as early as possible while limiting the burden of screening in high-risk women. To this end, risk will be estimated from magnetic resonance images of the breast as well as mammograms using deep learning techniques. A retrospective analysis of a very large dataset will determine if some women could have avoided unnecessary scans without missing newly developing cancers.",Machine learning for risk-adjusted breast MRI screening,10121555,R01CA247910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancerous', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'High Risk Woman', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reader', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast imaging', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data exchange', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'individualized prevention', 'large datasets', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'quality assurance', 'radiologist', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'screening program', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2021,703284
"Convergent AI for Precise Breast Cancer Risk Assessment ABSTRACT  Breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the United States, despite the advances made in the identification of prognostic and predictive markers for breast cancer treatment. Mammographic reporting is the first step in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Abnormal mammographic findings such as a mass, abnormal calcifications, architectural distortion, and asymmetric density can lead to a cancer diagnosis. The American College of Radiology developed the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to standardize mammographic reporting to facilitate biopsy decision-making. However, application of the BI-RADS lexicon has resulted in substantial inter-observer variability, including inappropriate term usage and missing data. This observer variability has lead in part to a considerable variation in the rate of biopsy across the US, with a majority of breast biopsies ultimately found to be benign lesions. Hence, there is the need for a system that can better stratify the risk of cancer and define a more optimum threshold for biopsy. To address this need, we propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques.  This study aims to develop a well-defined, novel risk assessment system incorporating multi-modality datasets with a novel predictive model that outputs a probability measure of cancer that is more clinically relevant and informative than the six discrete BI-RADS scores. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI- RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a predictive model that is more precise and clinically relevant may be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group. Our proposed technique entails a novel strategy using Natural Language Processing to extract pertinent clinical risk factors related to breast cancer from vast amounts of patient charts automatically and integrate them with corresponding image-omics data and radiologist- generated reports. We will extract and quantitate image features from both large amounts of mammography and breast ultrasound images and combine them with the radiology reports and pertinent clinical risk profile and other patient characteristics to generate a risk assessment score to aid radiologists and oncologists in breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decisions. Such a web-based application tool will be the first breast cancer risk assessment system based on integrative radiomics data augmented by AI methods. The iBRISK tool will enhance engagement between the patient and clinician for making an informed decision on whether or not to biopsy.  Our hypothesis is that BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics contain significant features for the breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decision-making. By using BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics, we will be able to develop new metrics to better breast cancer risk assessment. The novelty of the breast cancer risk assessment system is that it will incorporate a new predictive model that deploys deep learning and AI technology to provide a more reliable stratification of the BI-RADS subtypes for breast cancer risk assessment and reduce unnecessary breast biopsies and patients’ anxiety. Project Narrative  We propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI-RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a more precise and clinically relevant predictive model will be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group. The more reliable stratification of BI-RADS subtypes for breast cancer risk assessment will reduce the number of unnecessary breast biopsies and save billions of dollars in medical costs annually.",Convergent AI for Precise Breast Cancer Risk Assessment,10172878,R01CA251710,"['Address', 'American College of Radiology', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Communication', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Ultrasonography', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodist Church', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Probability', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'augmented intelligence', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast imaging', 'calcification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer type', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'demographics', 'density', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NCI,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,503083
"Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk SUMMARY Risk of developing contralateral breast cancer is a major concern among breast cancer survivors, especially for those who received radiotherapy for a first primary breast cancer. The risk of developing radiation-associated contralateral breast cancer (RCBC) is further increased among those who were exposed to radiation at an early age. Several genotyping studies have shown that variation in the individual risk of developing RCBC is associated with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic variants. However, these studies have mainly analyzed a limited set of target/candidate SNPs that had been associated with general primary breast cancer in prior studies. This approach, building predictive models based on a small set of SNPs, has made marginal progress in distinguishing individual risk of RCBC. To the contrary, complex phenotypes or traits are likely the result of interactions of many biological sub-systems, most of which individually provide small effect size to predictive models, incrementally improving risk prediction. We have recently developed novel machine learning methods that use genome-wide SNPs to build patient-specific risk models of radiation-induced toxicity. These models use hundreds of SNPs in a nonlinear fashion and can be used to identify key biological correlates. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinical decision support tool that can be used to guide radiotherapy treatment decisions based on individual risk of RCBC. To improve patient-specific risk prediction of RCBC, we propose to apply these innovative methods to a rich dataset of the Women’s Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study. Under SA1: Genome-wide genotyping of the WECARE Study II, as part of this grant, we will complete genome-wide association studies (GWAS) genotyping of 1626 samples from the WECARE Study II. Under SA2.1: Predictive modeling and biological analysis, we will apply our novel machine learning methods to the combined WECARE Study I and II to design a predictive model of RCBC risk in a young subpopulation treated with radiotherapy, using GWAS genotyping, clinical, and radiation data. We will also use bioinformatics methods to identify key biological correlates associated with RCBC risk. Under SA2.2: Comparison of biological correlates between subgroups, we will further investigate biological processes associated with radiation-unrelated contralateral breast cancer for the combined cohort in the WECARE Study I and II who did not receive radiotherapy. The resulting biological correlates will be compared with those found in SA2.1 for radiotherapy-treated women to better understand RCBC-specific biological mechanisms. Our model validation using an independent series of childhood cancer survivors who have developed radiation-associated breast cancer will enable us to examine the reliability and reproducibility of the model as a decision-making tool. If the RCBC risk model is validated, it will provide a clinical guide to identify high-risk patients who may need altered radiotherapy techniques (e.g., proton therapy), which offer reduced scatter dose. NARRATIVE Young women who receive radiotherapy are at increased risk for radiation-associated breast cancer. We have developed innovative modeling methods to build a predictive model of radiation-associated breast cancer risk based on patient genetic profiles using the unique, multi- center WECARE Study dataset for this study. If successful with rigorous validation on an independent dataset, this project will result in a clinical tool that could be used to inform breast cancer treatment decisions for young women at increased risk of radiation-associated breast cancer.",Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk,10104459,R21CA234752,"['Age', 'Age-Years', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chest', 'Childhood Cancer Survivor Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Contralateral Breast', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Late Effects', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Scattering', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Induced Cancer', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Factor', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological systems', 'cancer genetics', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'dosimetry', 'environment related cancer', 'environmental radiation', 'epidemiology study', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lifetime risk', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'proton therapy', 'radiation risk', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R21,2021,167926
"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories.

"Predicting Long-Term Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment ABSTRACT Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects an estimated 60% of patients, negatively impacting quality of life. Currently, there is no established method for predicting which patients will develop CRCI. This information could be practice-changing by assisting clinicians with treatment decision-making for individual patients. We have shown that the brain network (“connectome”) is significantly altered in patients with CRCI. Therefore, we measured the connectome is patients prior to any treatment and demonstrated that these connectome properties could be used in combination with machine learning to predict 1 year post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment with 100% accuracy. The proposed project aims to test this preliminary prediction model in a new, larger sample with the overarching goal of validating its use for clinical practice. We will enroll 100 newly diagnosed patients with primary breast cancer scheduled for adjuvant chemotherapy who will be assessed prior to any treatment, including surgery with general anesthesia, 1 month after chemotherapy treatment and again 1 year later. We will also enroll matched healthy female controls who will be assessed at yoked intervals. We will combine these data with retrospective data we obtained during a prior study for a total sample of 150 in each group. Data from healthy controls will be used to determine impairment status in patients with breast cancer and to provide a template of typical connectome organization for comparison. We hypothesize that our machine learning model will accurately predict 1 year post- chemotherapy cognitive impairment and that it will be more accurate than a model that includes patient- related and medical variables alone. We will also examine longitudinal changes in connectome organization associated with impairment subtypes (i.e. persistent vs. late onset impairment) as well as changes in specific functional networks (e.g. default mode, salience, executive-attention and sensory- motor networks). This information will provide novel insights regarding the neural mechanisms of CRCI and may also help us refine our prediction models. RELEVANCE A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to validate a model for predicting who will develop long-term cognitive impairment and to examine the underlying causes of this impairment. This research is highly relevant to breast cancer, one of the most common public health problems, affecting 1 in 8 women.",Predicting Long-Term Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment,10124310,R01CA226080,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'chemobrain', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'connectome', 'disability', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'social']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,281784
"Developing a personalized breast cancer screening tool using sequential mammograms Project Summary The current breast cancer screening recommendations are essentially a one-size fits all approach and, therefore, not optimal in terms of effectiveness and resource utilization. This is because the typical approach focuses on finding subgroups of women who are at “higher than average risk” for developing breast cancer and aggressively promoting additional imaging techniques. However, most women (approximately 70%) who get breast cancer do not have any known risk factors. In addition, the majority of women (approximately 88%) never get breast cancer and these women benefit the least from breast cancer screening. To maximize the benefit to all women and minimize possible harms, investigators have advocated personalized screening using a woman's individual breast cancer risk. To do so, it is essential to have a marker that can provide an accurate near term mammography-detectable breast cancer (mBCa) risk to identify women with very high or very low near term mBCa risk. The goal of this application is to provide person-centered markers of mBCa risk, thus, offering a personalized screening strategy. We hypothesize that we can use temporal changes and lateral differences in images extracted by a novel imaging transformation from sequential mammograms to develop image-based risk markers that can provide women with an accurate near-term mBCa risk from their last negative mammography exam. We will build a database (N= 1,200, 400 cases and 800 controls) of sequential (≥ 5 years) full field digital mammograms collected from the medical records of women over 40 years of age for development and additional independent validation dataset (N = 600, 200 cases, 400 controls) for validation. We will develop year-specific risk markers using a novel Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (RCDT), convolutional neural network (CNN), and traditional non-imaging markers (such as age). RCDT effectively compares any two lateral and temporal mammograms and highlights differences between the two without having to explicitly align the two images. We will use CNN as a robust imaging marker to analyze the resulting RCDT images from mammograms. Using a statistical approach for handling longitudinal data based on risk sets, we will combine imaging-based risk markers and conventional non-imaging risk factors to develop two near-term risk markers, one for accurately predicting very high risk of having mBCa within a few years and another for predicting very low risk of having mBCa within a few years. High-risk and low-risk markers will be optimized separately to maximize the sizes of accurately predicted high and low risk groups. Project Narrative There is much controversy surrounding breast cancer screening guidelines, resulting in women making individual choices regarding their screening, in consultation with their physician. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information available to women as to the benefit of screening mammography for them as an individual. Our research goal is to develop a near-term mammography-detectable breast cancer risk marker using a new image transformation, deep learning, and statistical approach for longitudinal data on serial mammograms that will help women choose their own personalized protocol in consultation with their doctor.",Developing a personalized breast cancer screening tool using sequential mammograms,10174885,R37CA248207,"['Advocate', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'High Risk Woman', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radon', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Screening procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast density', 'cancer risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'data curation', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized screening', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,357994
