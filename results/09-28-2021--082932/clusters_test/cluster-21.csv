"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,10118191,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2021,177444
"Reliable prediction of high-risk infants of autism with cortical microstructural biomarker Abstract  The diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is based on behavioral assessments that cannot be confirmed until 2-3 years of age. ASD affects 1 in 59 children in the U.S., and infants from high-risk families have 20 times of risk to develop ASD compared to the general population. Current paradigm misses the precious time window for potential early intervention from birth to 2-3 years of age. Therefore, the focus in ASD research is shifting toward developing early biomarkers which can predict the risk of an infant developing future behavioral abnormalities, while the infant is still in pre- symptomatic stage. Imaging markers play major roles in understanding of both ASD and typical developing (TD) brains. Neural MRI at early infancy may improve the current paradigm for diagnosis for ASD in high-risk infants. Macrostructural measurements such as cortical thickness and surface area from conventional T1 weighted MRI (T1w) have been the primary measurements for characterizing the maturation of infant cortex. However, T1w MRI cannot reveal information about the complex microstructural changes inside the cortical mantle. Cortical microstructure, associated with the underlying cellular and molecular processes, plays a vital role in neuronal circuit formation and emergence of brain functions. We have recently developed a novel protocol to quantify the cortical microstructure using advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI), including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). These advanced dMRI-based cortical microstructural measurements are sensitive imaging markers for the microstructural differentiation that characterizes the infant cortex maturation. We hypothesize that dMRI-based cortical microstructure measurements in early infancy could be potential biomarkers for early detection of ASD in high-risk infants. The goal of this study is to develop and test a novel protocol, using dMRI-based cortical microstructure feature, to reliably predict clinical score of infants at high risk for ASD and other brain disorders in general. We aim: 1) to develop a technique that incorporates dMRI-based cortical microstructural measures at early infancy with cutting-edge multi-kernel machine learning algorithms to reliably predict infants’ future neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age; 2) to demonstrate the initial clinical utility of the technique in infants at high-risk for ASD. To accomplish these goals, we leverage a large cohort of infant study that consists 100 TD infants who longitudinally undergo multi- modal MRI scans at early infancy and neuropsychological testing at 2 years for developing the prediction techniques, and a high-risk ASD study that allows us to longitudinally image the infants during infancy for testing our developed techniques. Finally, it should be emphasized that, although the present project focuses on its clinical applications in infants at high risk for ASD, the method developed also has important utility in detecting behavioral abnormalities in high risk subjects for other brain disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, ADHD), at a time prior to the age of diagnosis. Thus, this technique is expected to have a broad clinical impact. Narrative Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) based cortical microstructural measurements are sensitive markers characterizing infant cortex maturation. The present application aims to develop a technique that incorporates these advanced dMRI-based cortical microstructural measures at early infancy with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to reliably predict infants’ future neurodevelopmental outcomes and clinical scores. This technique is expected to have a range of clinical applications in detecting behavioral abnormality in subjects at high risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, at a time prior to the age of diagnosis.",Reliable prediction of high-risk infants of autism with cortical microstructural biomarker,10218522,R21MH123930,"['2 year old', '3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Broca&apos', 's area', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Language', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autism diagnostic observation schedule', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'density', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'early detection biomarkers', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk infant', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'infancy', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neonate', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'regression algorithm', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'serial imaging', 'synaptogenesis']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2021,218963
"Gait and communication growth in typical development and autism spectrum disorder Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1 in 59 children in the United States1 and incurs substantial public health burden over the lifespan2. Although one of the strongest predictors of later independence for individuals with ASD is early language ability3,4, the mechanisms underlying disrupted language development in ASD are not well understood. Recent research indicates that the transition from crawling to walking represents a sensitive period for language development, during which infants with ASD exhibit atypical trajectories of language growth. For typically-developing (TD) infants, walk onset is closely linked with a sudden increase in infants’ rate of language acquisition5–8 and dramatic changes in how infants perceive and interact with their environment. Emerging evidence indicates that infants with ASD do not exhibit the same “spurt” in language development following walk onset as their TD peers5, but reasons for this difference are not yet known. We propose that gait control, the ability to effectively regulate and coordinate the rhythmic movements needed for walking, is a fundamental mechanism supporting language growth following walk onset that is impaired in infants with ASD. Poor gait control may impede language acquisition after walk onset by making it difficult for children to access the increased communicative learning opportunities that walking affords, including seeing more faces9 and having hands free to gesture10 and share objects with others11,12. Regions of the brain known to support gait and postural control exhibit atypical structure and function in individuals with ASD13,14, and older children and adults with ASD exhibit poorer gait control15–17, indicating that gait control may be fundamentally disrupted in ASD. However, no studies to date have prospectively assessed early gait control in infants with ASD. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate gait control as a potential mechanism linking ASD to change in the rate of language growth after walk onset. This study will test whether gait control 4 weeks after walk onset (measured by a pressure- sensitive gait mat) predicts change in the rate of language growth following walk onset in infants at high and low familial risk for ASD (Aim 1). Next, we will examine whether ASD symptoms at 24 months are associated with gait control after walk onset (Aim 2). Finally, the proposed study will also explore whether innovative computer vision technology can provide an infant gait assessment tool that is more scalable to settings outside the lab than current gold-standard pressure-sensitive gait mats (Aim 3). This study will be the first to explicitly test the relationships between gait control, language development, and ASD symptoms. In so doing, it will yield a deeper understanding of the link between early motor and language development during this sensitive period, with the potential to identify possible targets for early intervention to promote improved language outcomes in infants with ASD. Taken together, this project and the accompanying training plan will prepare the applicant for a research career investigating the early motor and social communication development in ASD. Project Narrative Learning to walk is associated with a significant increase in the rate of language development for typically- developing infants, but not for infants who go on to receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While the reasons for this difference remain unclear, previous research indicates that children and adults with ASD are impaired in their ability to control the gross motor movements involved in walking, which may impede their ability to take advantage of the increased communicative learning opportunities that walking affords. By (1) prospectively testing the relationship between early gait control, language development, and ASD symptoms, and (2) developing a scalable computer vision tool for the automatic assessment of infant gait, the proposed study will investigate gait control as a potential mechanism contributing to disrupted language growth in ASD and make it possible to identify and study early gait impairment on an unprecedented scale.",Gait and communication growth in typical development and autism spectrum disorder,10199744,F31MH123033,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Assessment tool', 'Brain region', 'Calendar', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Chiroptera', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Periodicity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Walking', 'Width', 'adult with autism spectrum disorder', 'autism diagnostic observation schedule', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'career', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'language onset', 'language outcome', 'peer', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'recruit', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,48536
"Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants. Project Summary Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) has revealed two major principles of the functional organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in human adults. First, some regions of VTC respond selectively to a specific category of stimuli, such as the fusiform face area (FFA) which responds more to faces than to any other stimulus category. The second principle of organization is that different categories of stimuli have systematically distinct patterns of response across the entire VTC. How do these two key aspects of VTC functional organization in adults arise in development? The goal of my research program is to discover if these organizing principles are present in the infant brain (Aims 1 and 2) and design computational models to test different theories of cortical development (Aim 3). The dissertation work in this proposal will provide invaluable data toward the goal of refining theories of cortical development. In addition to innovations that enhance the quality of awake infant fMRI data, Aim 1 provides the first evidence that like adults, infants have face-selective responses in the FFA, scene-selective responses in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), and body-selective responses in the extrastriate body area (EBA). Aim 2 directly follows this up by asking if infants have systematically distinct patterns of response across higher- level visual areas that are similar to those found in the adult brain. The F99 phase of this proposal will provide training to optimize machine learning (ML) techniques that can withstand the unique challenges of infant fMRI data – specifically unbalanced and missing data. The F99 phase will be conducted at MIT, an intellectual environment with access to leaders in the fields of ML, cognitive neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Finally, Aim 3 of this proposal is to build computational models designed to test current theories of cortical development. The K00 phase of this proposal will provide training on the design and implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) models as well as training on the best methods to test ANN models using infant fMRI data. Research for the K00 phase will provide a new mentorship experience with an established investigator in computational neuroscience and will take place at an institution with a thriving intellectual environment that has access to an MRI scanner and the computational resources necessary to build a variety of ANN models. In summary, the objective of the proposed research is to determine if the principles of functional organization in the adult brain are present in infants. Insights from this proposal will advance and refine theories of cortical development and have the potential to be applicable to other domains such audition and language. Further, by combining my predoctoral training in awake infant fMRI with my proposed postdoctoral training in computational modeling, the proposed research will enable me to become an independent investigator and leader in the field of computational developmental neuroscience. Project Narrative The last 20 years of cognitive neuroscience has revealed the functional architecture of the human brain with an exquisite degree of detail yet has left wide-open the question of what guides the precise development, organization, and structure of the human mind. This proposal outlines a plan to unify developmental cognitive neuroscience and computational cognitive neuroscience to uncover the starting state of the human visual system and how it develops. The proposed research stands to not only inform and refine theories of cortical development and inform our understanding of neurodevelopmental differences, but also has the potential to begin to unravel one of the most intriguing questions available to humanity: what are the origins of the human mind?",Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants.,10319402,F99NS124175,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Social Desirability', 'Social support', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computing resources', 'design', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning community', 'model design', 'object recognition', 'organizational structure', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'response', 'social cognition', 'social engagement', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'tool', 'vision development']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F99,2021,47036
"The Gut Microbiome Brain Axis and Preterm Infants PROJECT SUMMARY  Infancy is increasingly being recognized as a key time point of microbiome establishment that impacts neonatal health as well as later outcomes. The intestinal microbiome has specifically been implicated in neurologic outcomes via the gut-brain axis. However, means by which the intestinal microbiome can have influence on the brain are poorly understood. The preterm infant is at the nexus of these unknowns. Preterm infants are a vulnerable patient population at risk for significant poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Preterm infant brain development occurs in parallel with intestinal microbiome development, thus modification of the intestinal microbiome is a potential means of improving neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that distinct gut microbiome taxa and metabolites at key time points improve preterm infant neurodevelopmental outcomes at school age.  Our preliminary and published data in gnotobiotic mouse models demonstrates that different early preterm infant microbiota impact neuron number, myelination, and behavior. This proposal will use our ongoing MIND (Microbiome In Neonatal Development) preterm infant cohort to determine how the gut microbiome impacts neurodevelopmental potential in the NICU, and how it may alter neurodevelopmental trajectories post- NICU discharge. We will conduct longitudinal sampling of participant fecal and blood samples to monitor gut microbiome as well as fecal and serum metabolites. We will also perform neurodevelopmental testing during the NICU course and up until preschool/school age (3.5-5 years old). School readiness, which describes children's strengths, challenges, and needs for supports when learning in the classroom, is a functional outcome that differs from single summary measures of intelligence (IQ) and will be the outcome measure.  A combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics and metabonomics will be applied to the collected fecal samples. Sophisticated machine learning strategies will be used to develop novel models of preterm infant gut microbiome succession with time as a critical element. Serum cytokine analysis and metabonomics will provide mechanistic insight into how the gut microbiome may be impacting neurodevelopment. We have established complementary in vivo gnotobiotic mouse models, in which germ-free mice are transfaunated with preterm infant microbiota. This state-of-the-art experimental model will allow specific investigation of the impact of clinically relevant microbiota on brain development that is not possible in human infants. The goal of this proposal is to discover intestinal microbiome patterns associated with school readiness, identify the key time points that represent windows of opportunity for microbiome optimization, and identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiome impacts brain development and behavior. This new knowledge will enhance our understanding of the gut-brain axis and lay the foundation for microbial based therapeutics to improve infant neurodevelopmental trajectories. PROJECT NARRATIVE The intestinal microbiome has impact beyond the gut and the existence of a gut-brain axis has been proposed. Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. This proposal will study how the changes in bacterial colonization patterns of preterm infants over time from birth until school age impact brain development, and thus school readiness and learning for these vulnerable infants.",The Gut Microbiome Brain Axis and Preterm Infants,10200392,R01HD105234,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '5 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genes', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head circumference', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurons', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior test', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'functional outcomes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut-brain axis', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intestinal barrier', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy design']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,705079
"Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care ABSTRACT – Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care  The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate novel tools to identify risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infants 6-12 months of age in a pediatric primary care setting. Research has confirmed that ASD is associated with changes in brain and behavior that are evident during infancy, and proof-of-concept studies suggest that early intervention during the infant period can improve early brain function and developmental outcomes. Moreover, early universal autism screening has been shown to reduce existing disparities based on socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnicity/race in access to early diagnosis and treatment. This project leverages ongoing work that is currently funded as part of the Duke NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Award (NICHD P50 HD093074; Dawson, Center Director), which is evaluating a novel digital phenotyping tool for early ASD risk assessment in toddler-age children in a pediatric primary care setting. Our novel screening tool, SenseToKnow, is based on active closed-loop sensing, where children are shown brief, developmentally-appropriate, dynamic stimuli on a smart tablet or smartphone, while the sensors in the same device capture information for automatic, objective quantification of several behavioral risk markers, based on patterns of attention, orienting, affect, vocalizations, and motor behavior. The proposed research will 1) evaluate a novel infant version of the app, SenseToKnow-Infant, in a large population of infants in the context of routine pediatric care, and 2) examine the utility of a multi- modal approach to risk assessment that combines information from SenseToKnow-I with information from infant and maternal electronic health records (EHRs). Using both direct digital behavioral measurement via SenseToKnow-I and data readily available in the EHR, we aim to develop and validate a multimodal ASD risk assessment algorithm for use in infants (6-12 months of age) that can be deployed in the general population.

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic.

"Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess Parent-Infant Interactions as a Mechanism Linking COVID-related Stress and Infant Neurobehavioral Functioning The young child’s ability to regulate stress sets the foundation for a host of developmental outcomes, and the parent-infant relationship is the primary context in which stress regulation capacities first develop. Prior research underscores how parents’ own stress may lead to disturbances in parent-infant co-regulation of stress. Given the immense disruptions to family life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to understand the degree to which COVID-related stress may impact the parent-infant relationship and ultimately infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes. We posit here that (a) maternal stress due to the pandemic will be associated with disturbances in the mother-infant relationship, particularly with respect to mother-infant co- regulation of infant distress and (b) mothers’ experiences of COVID-related stress will have an indirect effect on infant neurobehavioral outcomes, in part, due to disturbances to the mother-infant relationship. We also aim to investigate risk factors (e.g., maternal depressive symptoms, substance use; infant negative emotionality) that might exacerbate such linkages, as well as protective factors (e.g., maternal social support, coping) that may attenuate them. We will partner with six sites from the NIH HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study- Phase 1 (New York University, Oregon Health Sciences University, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute) that will permit addressing the proposed aims among a geographically diverse sample of 240 families with infants between 6 and 18 months of age. To assess key constructs relevant to mother-infant relationship disturbance, we will use a novel multimodal sensing platform that captures infant vocalizations, stress physiology, and motor behavior, and we will employ machine learn approaches to these multimodal data to yield automated assessments of mother-infant co-regulation of infant distress. By combining assessments of (a) mothers’ COVID-related experiences, as well as maternal, family, and infant functioning, collected by the six HBCD sites via maternal reports and virtual visits and (b) mother-infant co-regulation of stress in home environments using remote multimodal sensing technology, the current study will provide unique opportunities for a nuanced and rich understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on infants born during this unprecedented time. Downstream effects of COVID-19 on infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes are likely to be transmitted, in part, through disruptions in the parent-infant relationship due to parents’ heightened stress and poorer mental health. This project will investigate such downstream effects using novel technology and machine learning methods that permit remote assessment of infants and parents in the home. Results from this project may aid in the development of “just-in-time” interventions for parents and infants at risk for relationships disturbance.",Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess Parent-Infant Interactions as a Mechanism Linking COVID-related Stress and Infant Neurobehavioral Functioning,10239919,R34DA050256,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Arkansas', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Church', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Services', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Home Economics', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Job loss', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Mind', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'New York', 'North Carolina', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'caregiving', 'coping', 'coronavirus disease', 'depressive symptoms', 'economic impact', 'experience', 'falls', 'infancy', 'infection rate', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'maternal stress', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'patient home care', 'phase 1 study', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'remote sensing', 'resilience', 'sensor technology', 'social culture', 'stressor', 'virtual', 'virtual visit', 'vocalization']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R34,2021,234822
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9981015,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'home test', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2021,118352
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC.",Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools,10141299,R01MH117943,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education and Outreach', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'file format', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,465332
"Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships Project Summary Infants communicate to their caregivers that they need food by crying. This represents our very first social interaction that lays the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing a strong social bond with caregivers. Infants that cannot regulate their nutrition are at risk for malnourishment or obesity, whose deleterious effects will negatively impact the wellness of these individuals for their lifetime. Abnormalities in social recognition and communication, like those found in autism spectrum disorders, also become apparent during infancy. Despite the critical importance of infants communicating nutritional need to caregivers, the neuronal basis remains unknown. To address this deficit, I propose to study social tadpoles that beg their parents for food by dancing. Tadpoles use this begging display to encode nutritional state, enabling us to quantify hunger- based communication. These tadpoles are translucent, allowing us to visualize the development and activity of neurons in the brain. I am combining this novel model system and behavioral paradigm with advanced neurogenetic tools to interrogate the neuronal substrates of hunger-based communication. I will examine whether nutritional quality influences the development of neurons that regulating feeding and communication with in vivo brain imaging. I will also test for a functional role of these neuronal cell-types in begging behavior using a high throughput behavior assay, whole brain clearing and immunohistochemistry, and cell-specific manipulations of neuronal activity. As social recognition is important for establishing parent-offspring bonds, I will then use in vivo neural activity imaging to determine how tadpoles recognize their parents using multi-modal sensory integration. Completion of these experiments will transform our understanding of a social behavior critical for infant survival and life-long wellbeing. There is a pressing need for this research because there are currently no established models for studying the neural mechanisms of infant communication of hunger. This work is important to public health because some of the most prevalent disorders afflicting children in the United States are eating related disorders and conditions involving abnormalities in social recognition and communication, such as autism spectrum disorders. More research on infant feeding and communication is needed to better understand these pathologies in the youngest members of our society. Narrative Communication of nutritional need during infancy is our very first social interaction, laying the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing strong social bonds with caregivers. The proposed work uses a unique biological model – social tadpoles that communicate nutritional need to their caregivers – to uncover how infants evaluate their nutritional state, recognize their caregivers, and communicate that they need food. These studies have implications for informing preventative strategies and treatments for childhood obesity and autism spectrum disorders, two of the most prevalent diseases afflicting the youngest members of our society.",Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships,10263607,DP2HD102042,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Communication', 'Critical Thinking', 'Crying', 'Dancing', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Eating', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hunger', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Life', 'Methodology', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Study models', 'Tadpoles', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'member', 'multimodality', 'neurogenetics', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity in children', 'offspring', 'parent grant', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social attachment', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP2,2021,86547
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,10065509,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Well Child Visits', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2021,605422
"Harmonizing and Archiving of Large-scale Infant Neuroimaging Data Project Abstract The first postnatal years are an exceptionally dynamic and critical period of structural and functional development of the human brain. Many neurodevelopmental disorders are the consequence of abnormal brain development during this stage. Several NIH-funded studies have recently acquired and released large-scale infant brain MRI datasets in the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA), leading to over 3,000 publically-available infant MRI scans from multiple imaging sites. Joint analysis of these big data of infant brains will undoubtedly improve our limited understanding of normative early brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders with boosted statistical power and reproducibility. However, the processed and harmonized data of these multi-site infant MR images still remain publically absent, due to the challenges in processing and analyzing infant MR images, which typically exhibit extremely low tissue contrast, large within-tissue intensity variations, and regionally-heterogeneous dynamic changes. To address this critical issue, the goal of this project is to comprehensively process, harmonize, discover and archive large-scale, multi-site public infant MRI datasets to significantly advance early brain development studies, by taking advantage of our infant-tailored computational tools and further developing advanced machine learning techniques. In Aim 1, we will extensively process large-scale infant MRI datasets by adopting our established and recently-improved infant- dedicated cortical surface-based computational tools and further develop a deep spherical neural network for quality control of produced cortical property maps. This will lead to quality-ensured vertex-wise maps of multiple biologically-distinct cortical properties, e.g., cortical thickness, surface area, myelin content, sulcal depth, local gyrification, curvature and diffusivity. In Aim 2, to remove site effects associated with different scanners and imaging protocols and meanwhile preserve biological associations, we will harmonize the computed cortical property maps from multi-site data in Aim 1 by leveraging our surface-to-surface cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (S2SGAN) based on the spherical U-Net, without requiring traveling subjects (paired data) across sites. To further increase the efficiency and learn more robust feature representation in the whole multi- site data, we propose to extend S2SGAN to jointly harmonize all multi-site cortical property maps using a single generator. In Aim 3, leveraging the informative growth patterns and gradient information of the harmonized maps of multiple cortical properties in Aim 2, we will discover distinct cortical regions, by capitalizing on multi-view nonnegative matrix factorization in a data-driven manner, without making any assumption on the parametric forms of growth patterns. All our processed data, results, computational tools, and source codes will be deposited into NDA, NITRC, and GitHub to significantly accelerate the pace of early brain development studies. Project Narrative This project aims to comprehensively process, harmonize, discover, and archive large-scale, multi-site public infant neuroimaging data, by taking advantage of our pioneered infant-tailored computational tools and developing advanced machine learning techniques.

"Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Data to a Predictive Model of Neuroblastoma Project Summary There is currently no diagnostic tool to accurately predict pediatric neuroblastoma disease outcome that is based on the mechanistic nature of the disease and genomic information of a child’s tumor. Neuroblastoma is a solid, cancerous tumor of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that accounts for half of all cancers in infants younger than 1 year. Uncertainties in the trajectory of disease progression has led to aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments that often result in long-term developmental disabilities for children. Determination of the critical drivers of neuroblastoma initiation and assessment of their interactions for an individual child would help target chemotherapy and limit over-treatment, possibly resulting in an increased quality of life and infant survival. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) and use genomic input from a child’s tumor to test its predictive strengths to predict disease progression, identify critical disease drivers and compare results to current clinical statistical-based algorithms. PredictNeuroB is based on the network interactions of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) developmental signals and is supported by our discovery of a critical role for trkB and its ligand brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) during SNS development. Our published model’s prediction of early stage neuroblastoma (for infants 0-2yrs old) using genomic information of 77 children is more accurate than any current clinical prognostic (Kasemeier-Kulesa et al., 2018). In this study, we propose to strengthen the predictive capability of our model for a broader class of patient data (age, stage of disease, chromosome status, MYCN amplification) by applying Gabriella Miller Kids First neuroblastoma databases. Further, we will perform in silico perturbations of the algorithm to determine critical drivers capable of altering neuroblastoma outcome states. At the conclusion of our study, by using a larger set of patient-derived data with associated clinical and disease outcome information, we expect our PredictNeuroB model will prove highly predictive for a broad class of neuroblastoma patients and support clinical decision making in disease treatment and targeted drug therapies. Project Narrative Neuroblastoma accounts for half of all childhood cancers in infants younger than 1 year, yet there is no diagnostic tool to accurately predict disease progression and outcome. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) that is based on the developmental signaling network from which neuroblastoma originates and test its capability to more precisely predict disease outcome using a child’s genomic information as input. By leveraging the information in Gabriella Miller Kids First databases we will test PredictNeuroB for a broader class of children than available in published academic data, resulting in a precise and personalized prognostic tool with the possibility to increase infant quality of life and survival by limiting over-treatment and targeting chemotherapy.",Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Data to a Predictive Model of Neuroblastoma,10193881,R03HD105079,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cancerous', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'MYCN gene', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Research', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Staging System', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Testing', 'Tumor Markers', 'Uncertainty', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell motility', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'intelligent algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'nervous system development', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'personalized predictions', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'receptor', 'risk variant', 'surgical risk', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NICHD,STOWERS INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R03,2021,165000
