"The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate for this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award aims to become an international leader in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel health care interventions and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis that is diagnosed in utero but that persists after birth, or postnatally persistent hydronephrosis (PNH). The proposed mentored research and career development plan lays the foundation for this career and the eventual development of a standardized management strategy for PNH by generating the evidence needed to support its development and creating an ultrasound (U/S) grading tool needed to implement it in routine clinical practice. Kidney U/Ss are the main test to monitor PNH, but U/S reports are heterogeneously formatted and contain synonymous and ambiguous terms that complicate their interpretation. Another major obstacle in the field is a need to predict those at risk for worsening disease and to better understand the natural history of PNH. Aim 1 will develop a Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically translate free-text U/S reports into structured data providing the PNH grade. Aim 2 will use baseline U/S and renal scan data to predict the PNH grade at 2 years. Aim 3 will use growth curves to simulate PNH’s natural history and provide the time and frequency of disease resolution/improvement, stability, and progression. The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large tertiary care children’s hospital and core research skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. An integral part of his career development will be a continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team with complementary strengths. The candidate’s primary mentor is Rachel Hess, MD, MS. Dr. Hess is a world renown expert in implementing interventions in routine clinical care and has an exemplary track record of mentorship. Flory Nkoy, MD, MS, MPH, the candidate’s co-mentor, is an expert in bioinformatics and internationally recognized for developing, disseminating, and implementing pioneering approaches to treat chronic disease in children. Advisors include Jeffrey Ferraro, PhD, and Wendy Chapman, PhD (bioinformatics), Angela Presson, PhD (biostatistics), Patrick Cartwright, MD (pediatric urology), and Mark Ebert, MD (pediatric radiology). The proposed research and training plan will establish the candidate’s solid foundation in bioinformatics, augment his prior epidemiology and biostatistics training, and provide extraordinary training in dissemination and implementation science. This will provide him with the skills and experience necessary for a career as a successful independent researcher focused on developing, implementing, and disseminating novel management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero but persisting after birth (PNH) affects tens of thousands of infants each year in the United States, but its management is complicated by ambiguous reporting of hydronephrosis severity and a relatively limited understanding of predictors of disease outcome and knowledge of the disease’s natural history. The proposed research uses the largest known pediatric hydronephrosis cohort to develop a tool to translates free-text ultrasound reports into coded PNH grades, predict the 2-year outcome using 3-month baseline data, and apply sophisticated modeling techniques to simulate the disease’s natural history. Taken together, results from this proposal will lead to the development of a standardized management strategy for PNH and facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel treatment and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, beginning with pediatric hydronephrosis.",The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH),10086087,K08DK119535,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Infant', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Radiology', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Selection Bias', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologic Surgeon', 'Urology', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'in utero diagnosis', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatrician', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prognostic', 'research and development', 'skills', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2021,166997
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE: HERCULES Human health and disease is dictated by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The HERCULES Center is focused on providing a more comprehensive assessment of these environmental influences by utilizing exposome-based concepts and approaches.",HERCULES: Exposome Research Center,10144435,P30ES019776,"['Achievement', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Leadership', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Toxicology', 'Translations', 'Update', 'Vision', 'base', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'operation', 'ranpirnase', 'treatment strategy']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,1471985
"Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (R35) PROJECT SUMMARY The “Tools for Transmission of Agents and Conditions (TRAC)” program will synergize statistical and mathematical modeling work in three areas of application: 1) Tuberculosis (TB) incidence and transmission; 2) monitoring substance use disorder (SUD) patterns; and 3) SARS CoV-2 transmission modeling. These three conditions are major public health problems, with TB being the leading cause of infectious disease death globally, SUD causing more deaths in the United States than HIV/AIDS in its peak, and SARS CoV-2 causing a pandemic with societal disruption and mortality exceeding anything we have experienced in the last century. We need improved analytical tools that leverage existing data to monitor these diseases, infer transmission hot spots, determine the efficacy of interventions, and understand the burden of these conditions. This program will bring together an expert group of quantitative researchers with skills that are readily applied to these problems. We also leverage our strong collaborations with clinician researchers and public health officials to ensure that the methods we develop are addressing important questions and consistent with our current understanding of these diseases. By creating a program to facilitate communication between these experts, we will enable greater innovation in modeling key aspects of these diseases and create exciting methodological synergies across diseases. Our team is well positioned to incorporate data from emerging technologies, including high throughput sequencing data to determine TB risk signatures and inform transmission links for TB and SARS CoV-2. Our expertise in machine learning, a broad range of statistical methodologies, and mathematical modeling will enable us to leverage the rich information in large databases that are emerging to better understand SUD patterns and identify risk signatures. We will also build infrastructure with our partners to make the analytical tools that we develop more accessible to public health practitioners and other researchers. The impact of this work is to develop a suite of analytical tools that leverage rapidly emerging rich data sets to improve our understanding of disease transmission patterns, monitor changing dynamics of these conditions, and understand intervention strategies that are most effective. This work will inform public health practice for these diseases and create reproducible tools that can be used in an ongoing way. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will generate analytical tools to address three major public health challenges: 1) Tuberculosis, 2) Substance use disorders, and 3) SARS CoV-2. These tools will improve our understanding of the transmission patterns of these diseases, advance our ability to monitor them, and inform intervention strategies. We will build infrastructure to make these methods available to public health practitioners and other researchers.",Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (R35),10205596,R35GM141821,"['2019-nCoV', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 transmission', 'Statistical Models', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'skills', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R35,2021,171876
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,10129203,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2021,336445
"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. This knowledge can be utilized to reduce the public health burden of tobacco use.",Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment,10074543,R01CA224537,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anger', 'Behavioral', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'knowledge base', 'mobile computing', 'negative affect', 'primary outcome', 'risk prediction model', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'success']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,1
"Genetic determinants of thoracic aortic stiffness and remodeling Project Summary / Abstract This is an application for a K24 mentoring award for patient-oriented research (POR) from Julio Chirinos, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). Dr. Chirinos‘ long-term goals are to: (1) Substantially contribute to our understanding and approaches to the prevention and treatment of aortic aging and its associated disease burden, and; (2) to mentor the next generation of investigators interested in the epidemiology of aortic aging and its consequences in human health. This mid-career development award will be critical to help him achieve these goals via dedicated/protected time for mentoring activities, research and development of new skills that are anticipated to greatly enhance the applicant’s impact in this field throughout the rest of his career, as well as the impact and success of his trainees. The candidate has a strong record of mentorship, leadership, and research productivity. His research program encompasses epidemiologic, translational and POR studies of arterial aging and its role in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) and other conditions that afflict our aging population. The scientific goal of this proposal is to investigate the genetic determinants of age-related thoracic aortic stiffening and elongation using large available biobanks with associated genomic and aortic imaging data. These include the UK Biobank and the Penn Medicine Biobank. The projects will include the application of a novel method for quantification of aortic pulse wave velocity that can, for the first time, be applied retrospectively in widely available clinical imaging studies. Deep learning for high-throughput aortic phenotyping will play an important role in this research. The mentoring goals of this application are to engage and support the training of Penn fellows and junior faculty to conduct POR in arterial aging. The career development goal of this application is to support the candidate’s professional development and acquisition of new skills for POR research in aging, specifically: (1) genomics (genome-wide association studies, next generation sequencing, and Mendelian Randomization); (2) Applied deep learning to leverage large banks of imaging data in order to accomplish accurate high-throughput phenotyping of aortic aging. This will be achieved through formal training courses and engaging in sustained collaboration experiences with experts in these topics. The candidate will also engage in career development and promotion of arterial aging research through convening scientific meetings on aortic aging research and improving the national network of POR research in arterial aging through existing professional societies. The institutional environment for clinical and translational science at Penn is outstanding. The Department of Medicine at Penn has made a substantial commitment, including protected time and dedicated space, toward the candidate’s sustained success as a patient-oriented researcher responsible for training a new generation of junior investigators who conduct research in older participants.

"The Study of the Environment and Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias (SEAD) PROJECT SUMMARY The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a major public health and clinical challenge in the United States. Identification of ADRD causes to inform prevention and policy is the most efficient way to address these challenges. Most research to date has focused on identifying genetic causes of ADRD, however, recent population-scale studies have shown that environmental exposures, such as lead and cadmium, also contribute to ADRD risk and etiology. Initial findings on environmental factors linked to ADRD risk is promising, but human evidence is limited. A wide range of environmental exposures (exposome) have never been evaluated systematically in relation to incident ADRD. While there is a growing demand to predict future risk for ADRS more precisely, the role of exposomic data in improving ADRD risk prediction has never been evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a prospective cohort study by capitalizing on existing large-scale, United States nationally representative, multi-ethnic population-based data. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, from 1998-2010, n>15,000) has a variety of environmental chemical exposure measurements, behavioral risk factors, and clinical phenotypes, and when linked to Medicare data, provides up to 25 years of incident ADRD. We aim to (1) conduct a biologic hypothesis-based approach to test the associations of chronic exposure to lead and cadmium with incident ADRD; (2) conduct a data-driven environment-wide association study to systematically evaluate a wide-range of environmental toxicants with incident ADRD; and (3) develop and validate an exposome-based risk prediction model for ADRD using machine learning methods. The proposed study will advance scientific understanding on how modifiable and currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants can lead to the development of ADRD. This study assesses the exposome to improve prediction of future disease risk and define vulnerable populations more precisely. This research will highlight individual-level and population-level interventions (i.e. precision health) to effectively prevent or reduce the risk of ADRD in the US population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health and precision health because comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of modifiable environmental exposures, including the currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants lead and cadmium, will advance scientific understanding on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and inform individual-level and population-level interventions to effectively prevent or reduce the burden of ADRD. The proposed study is directly responsive to the 2018 National Institute on Aging AD Research Summit recommendations related to Understanding the Impact of the Environment to Advance Disease Prevention and Enabling Precision Medicine Research for AD/ADRD, and to the research goal of NOT-AG-18-053, Enabling precision medicine for AD/ADRD through deep molecular phenotyping.",The Study of the Environment and Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias (SEAD),10120924,R01AG070897,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cadmium', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotoxins', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'abeta deposition', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chronic Pb exposure', 'clinical phenotype', 'dementia risk', 'demographics', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'effective intervention', 'environmental chemical', 'environmental chemical exposure', 'follow-up', 'human population study', 'improved', 'lead exposure', 'machine learning method', 'modifiable risk', 'molecular phenotype', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'symposium', 'tau expression', 'toxicant']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,692598
"Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL—PROJECT SUMMARY Healthspan is a complex trait, influenced by many interacting polymorphic alleles and environmental factors that may accelerate or delay aging, reduce or increase disease risk, and/or promote extended lifespan. Thus, assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic and biological complexity of human populations while allowing for efficient identification and validation of candidate genes. With this proposal, the JAX NSC seeks support to further develop and disseminate the next generation of genetic, phenotyping, and information resources necessary to enable a systems-wide approach to understanding healthy aging. Over the past 15 years, The JAX NSC has transformed aging research both at JAX and across the geroscience community, providing central resources to support investigators that have resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications in the last funding period. The Center has developed nascent regional and national resources for aging research, including aging mouse resources and tissues that support our numerous collaborations and external researchers. All JAX NSC data and tools are publicly disseminated on the Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise acquired through the Center is readily available to the aging research community. In this renewal, we will advance towards our goal by providing unique resources, tools, and support to geroscience investigators while leveraging JAX's unparalleled expertise in the large-scale identification and functional validation of complex polygenic traits in mice. We will do this by providing effective Center administration and enhancing the utility of JAX NSC resources throughout the aging community (Aim 1); expanding the research focus on aging, healthspan and age-related diseases through a robust Research Development Core (Aim 2); increasing the diversity of mouse resources available for aging research, including a new study to, for the first time, investigate the effect of genetic variation on cellular senescence and treatment with senolytic drugs (Aim 3); strengthening the data and computational and support available to the aging community (Aim 4); expanding the use of machine learning technologies in interpretation of aging pathologies (Aim 5). The Center will be led by a highly experienced team of Principal Investigators and Core Leaders who, with oversight from an External Advisory Board, will provide effective management to facilitate the goals and objectives of the Center. The Center will leverage unparalleled institutional resources, facilities and expertise of The Jackson Laboratory, a globally renowned institution for mouse genetics research, to enhance its goals and the utility of the resources it generates for the aging research community. OVERALL—PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human aging is influenced by genetic factors, whereby differences in longevity as well as changes in health and disease risk with time are linked to variation in individuals' genetic codes.

"The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration Delirium is a serious cognitive disorder associated with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) that affects ~2.6 million older adults yearly. It is a frequent complication of acute illness, surgery and, now, of COVID-19 infection in older adults. Recognizing the relative dearth of delirium research, the National Institute for Aging (NIA) supported the establishment of the Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative interdisciplinary group of 28 investigators, from 27 institutions, to advance delirium research and develop network infrastructure. This included the creation of an annual “NIDUS bootcamp” conference, to bring together the growing national- and international delirium research community for networking and education. The bootcamp aims are to advance the science of the field and to provide junior investigators with intensive mentorship, through mock NIH application reviews, clinical and research lectures, breakout sessions, and post-bootcamp networking. Bootcamp alumni are provided guidance on: 1) using the NIDUS Delirium Research Hub, Measurement resources and Bibliography, 2) submitting proposals to the NIDUS Pilot Program (13 one-year $50,000 grants awarded), NIA GEMSSTAR/CLINSTAR, the Alzheimer’s Association, and other foundations, 3) attending Mentoring webinars, 4) participating in Junior Faculty Working Groups, and 5) submitting research abstracts to the American Delirium Society (ADS) Annual Meeting. As PIs, 94 alumni have received 46 grants, of which 18 (40%) were NIH-funded, and published 265 original peer- reviewed articles. NIDUS has jumpstarted the careers of many young investigators, particularly bootcamp alumni, enabling them to launch independent programs in delirium research. The goal of this application is to support continuation of a yearly, themed Delirium Bootcamp Conference (DBC), to ensure that the progress of this active research community is sustained. The first-year theme will be the inter-relationship between delirium and ADRD. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Engage and support junior investigators in delirium research through mentorship and access to the NIDUS resources/network (2) Boost the researchers’ funding success (3) Facilitate publication of delirium research and provide ongoing mentorship, and (4) Facilitate networking among junior, mid-career, and senior researchers during and after DBC. As the pool of delirium investigators expands, there is a critical need for a conference focused on addressing cutting-edge research methods in all areas of delirium research, including the relationship with ADRD, “-Omics” research, machine learning and big data, innovations in randomized trials, animal models and mechanistic research, and clinical practice improvement. The DBC will provide an unparalleled opportunity to advance cutting-edge delirium research through interactive didactic sessions and in-depth guidance on complex and nuanced research methods essential for the highest caliber and most impactful delirium research. Delirium is a serious, yet understudied, cognitive disorder that affects millions of elder Americans, and is closely related to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). The NIA-supported (2015-2020) Network for Investigation of Delirium Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative international network of delirium investigators, developed a successful, annual “NIDUS Bootcamp” conference, laying the foundation for this proposal. The new Delirium Bootcamp (DBC) will convene junior investigators and senior faculty in an annual conference with innovations including: 1) a new thematic focus each year, with the 2021 theme highlighting ADRD; 2) focus on high-impact, state-of-the-art methodologies to advance the field in new directions; 3) finding optimal methods to address the unique challenges of delirium research, and 4) developing collaborative interdisciplinary papers to be initiated at the DBC and completed in ongoing groups; thus, fostering the training, career development and success of the next generation of delirium investigators.",The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration,10237513,R13AG072860,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bibliography', 'Big Data', 'COVID-19', 'Caliber', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Delirium', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Expenditures', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Study Section', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'patient population', 'peer', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'senior faculty', 'skill acquisition', 'success', 'support network', 'symposium', 'systematic review', 'webinar', 'working group']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R13,2021,50000
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,10128442,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,167900
"Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes a training program to integrate the PI, Dr. Varadan's previous research efforts in informatics and machine learning into investigations pertaining to the etiology and progression of Barrett's Esophagus, a gastrointestinal disorder of significant public health interest. Much of Dr. Varadan's previous research has involved developing intelligent algorithms and informatics approaches to decode the interconnections within complex biological systems, with only a basic understanding of the clinical needs and complexities involved in translational research. The proposed project would provide a broad and in-depth mentored experience focused on clinical and biological aspects of Barrett's Esophagus, as well as added knowledge in the use of preclinical model systems to investigate biological mechanisms. The overall goal is to expand the PI's experience and training in the design and conduct of translational studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This objective will be achieved through a combination of didactic and research activities conducted under an exceptional mentoring team of translational researchers at Case Western Reserve University, spanning achievements across clinical management of GI disorders, molecular genetics and inflammatory processes associated with diseases of the gut. Accordingly, this proposal leverages Dr. Varadan's computational background to address an urgent and unmet need within the biomedical research community to develop reliable analytic approaches that can quantify signaling network activities in individual biological samples by integrating multi-omics measurements. We recently conceived a systems biology computational framework, InFlo, which integrates molecular profiling data to decode the functional states of cellular/molecular processes underpinning complex human diseases. Barrett's esophagus is one such complex disease gaining increasing importance to public health, as it is the known precursor to the deadly cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that the mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus remain elusive, a major objective of this proposal is to employ the InFlo framework combined molecular profiles derived from primary tissue cohorts, in vitro and in vivo model systems to establish the molecular roadmap of BE pathogenesis and disease recurrence, thus elucidating unifying mechanisms underlying this disease. This systems biology approach would enable the development of evidence-based, diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus and inform preventive strategies within at-risk populations. Project Narrative This proposal details a novel systems biology approach to enable seamless integration of patient molecular data to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. Using this novel integrative analytics approach, we propose to resolve the molecular basis for the development and recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus, a disease with significant public health importance, since it is a known precursor to a lethal esophageal cancer and the mechanisms underpinning this disease remain largely unknown. The findings from our proposed research will enable the development of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and will also inform preventive strategies in high-risk patient populations.",Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders,10086862,K25DK115904,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Columnar Epithelium', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Ephrins', 'Epithelial', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal Tissue', 'Esophagitis', 'Esophagus', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Squamous Epithelium', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'computer framework', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'in vivo Model', 'injury and repair', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'standard of care', 'stem cells', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational scientist', 'translational study']",NIDDK,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,171720
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures,10140420,R00MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive signature', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2021,248878
"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics.

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",10177978,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data repository', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenomics', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2021,744955
"Identifying effective and efficient approaches to tuberculosis screening in Brazilianprisons Abstract. The goal of this career development plan is to support Dr. Leonardo Martinez, an infectious disease epidemiologist, in developing an independent research program focused on increasing tuberculosis case detection in high-risk groups. In active tuberculosis case finding studies, the majority of individuals are unable to provide sputum. In our previous work in Brazilian prisons, mass screening for tuberculosis among incarcerated individuals found a hyperendemic level of disease burden, 3,900 cases per 100,000 prisoners. We hypothesize that the tuberculosis burden in these prisons is greater than our current estimates, as a majority of prisoners were unable to produce sputum and therefore were not evaluated by diagnostic tools such as GeneXpert, culture, and smear testing. A re-assessment of the tuberculosis burden is urgently needed in this setting as well as an assessment of the feasibility and value of non-sputum-based diagnostic tools to increase case detection and reduce ongoing transmission. Dr. Martinez proposes to: (1) measure the prevalence of undiagnosed TB and characteristics of tuberculosis among Brazilian prisoners who are unable to provide sputum samples at the baseline screening visit; (2) determine the feasibility and sensitivity of Mask Aerosol Sampling system (MASS), a novel tool that directly captures exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients, during a mass screening intervention; and (3) identify cost-effective algorithms for tuberculosis screening in prisons. The proposed project will leverage an NIH-funded R01 study (AI130058-01, PI, Andrews/Croda) by the primary mentors, which is ongoing and enrolls adults in several prisons located in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. This research plan forms the basis of a 5-year career development plan for Dr. Martinez under the mentorship of Drs. Jason Andrews (infectious diseases, epidemiology), Julie Parsonnet (adult infectious diseases), Julio Croda (infectious diseases, health policy), Yvonne Maldonado (pediatric infectious diseases), and Upinder Singh (infectious diseases) with consultants Robert Horsburgh (clinical epidemiology), Michael Barer (tuberculosis diagnostics), and Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert (cost-effectiveness analyses). This interdisciplinary group has developed a career development program for Dr. Martinez that includes: (1) fostering skills in designing field-based research and data collection; (2) application of statistical methods for the study of novel diagnostics; (3) effective usage of and experience with new advanced statistical methodologies related to decision-tree algorithmic creation, cost- effectiveness analysis, and mathematical modeling; (4) regular meetings with mentors and consultants; (5) presenting results at scientific meetings and seminars; (6) publishing in peer-reviewed journals; and (7) writing and submitting an R01 grant. Completion of this career development plan will allow Dr. Martinez to successfully compete for extramural funding in the future to continue researching non-sputum-based tuberculosis diagnostics in high-risk populations. Project Narrative. Increasing tuberculosis case detection, especially in high-risk groups, is critical to meet the World Health Organization’s End TB Strategy to reduce tuberculosis incidence by 90% globally by 2035. A significant barrier to achieving this goal is that a large proportion of patients are unable to produce sputum and are therefore are not evaluated with commonly used and recommended diagnostics such as GeneXpert, culture, and smear testing. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify and quantify the burden of undiagnosed tuberculosis in Brazilian prisoners, evaluate the feasibility and value of non-sputum-based diagnostics to improve case detection in this setting, and to identify cost-effective algorithms for tuberculosis screening in prisons.",Identifying effective and efficient approaches to tuberculosis screening in Brazilianprisons,10105242,K01AI156022,"['Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Algorithms', 'Brazil', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Contracts', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhalation', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health Policy', 'Imprisonment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Masks', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Natural History', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prisoner', 'Prisons', 'Program Development', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'case finding', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'point of care', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIAID,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K01,2021,128574

"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,10256016,RM1HG009034,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All of Us Research Program', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'CCL4 gene', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Conceptions', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Protection', 'Data Security', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'European Union', 'Family', 'Film', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Identity', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Privacy', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newspapers', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral economics', 'blockchain', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'data access', 'data privacy', 'data sharing', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genomic data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'legal implication', 'minimal risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'news', 'next generation', 'sex', 'social', 'social media']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2021,1051733
"The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This U24 application is written in response to RFA-AT-20-003 to establish a high-priority research network on emotional well-being (EWB). While psychological research on well-being has dramatically increased over the past 15 years, virtually all of this work has been descriptive and has not emphasized the “how” of well-being: How might well-being be cultivated? In addition, virtually all of the extant work on the correlates of individual differences in well-being has used responses on retrospective questionnaires as the primary tool to assess well-being. While there have been exciting findings, particularly relating individual differences in well-being to various indices of physical health, many questions remain and methodological limitations plague the validity of this work. This U24 network will assemble a highly multi-disciplinary group of 10 investigators across 3 (or more in the future) institutions to significantly advance our understanding of the “how” of EWB, identify the core plastic constituents of EWB, specify and/or develop robust measures of these constituents at biological, behavioral and experiential levels of analysis and characterize the plasticity of these constituents. The measurement strategy will ultimately focus on the development of technology-based passive measures of EWB that require no explicit user input and are highly scalable. The network will also focus its efforts on the development and evaluation of programs to train EWB and will assess whether such programs might serve as prevention strategies. The network will consist of scientists and scholars from a broad range of fields including psychology, neuroscience, electrical and computer engineering, population health and biology, computer science and the humanities. These scientists and scholars will focus on the following major aims: Aim 1: To arrive at a core consensus of the minimal set of constituents that can be described and measured at biological, behavioral and experiential levels that constitute the plastic elements of EWB and to specify already existing measures and /or develop novel measures of each of these constructs at each level of analysis. Aim 2: Using the active measures described in Aim 1, to develop passive measures using digital technologies of at least two of the core constituents of well-being. Aim 3: To develop pilot projects specifically focusing on prevention strategies for learning well-being in various samples. The network will train new investigators and bring established investigators into this new field, disseminate a framework for understanding the plasticity of well- being, a toolbox of measures for assessing the plasticity of components of well-being, and several pilot datasets that showcase the novel passive and field-friendly biological measures. In these ways, the network will dramatically accelerate progress in the nascent field of EWB. PROJECT NARRATIVE This U24 network on emotional well-being (EWB) will catalyze the emerging field of the plasticity of well-being and will showcase how well-being can be learned and the consequences of such skill development on physical and emotional health and on prevention of disease. A framework for understanding how well-being can be learned along with measures of the core components of well-being that can be learned will be developed and disseminated. The network will also train new investigators in this area and will engage established investigators to contribute to this field.","The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing",10151850,U24AT011289,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Cellular Phone', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Drug abuse', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Humanities', 'Individual Differences', 'Institution', 'Interruption', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Population Biology', 'Prevention strategy', 'Program Evaluation', 'Psychology', 'Publications', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Well in self', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mindfulness meditation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'skill acquisition', 'social', 'standard measure', 'technology development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web site']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U24,2021,30000
"Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control 7. Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading major cause of preventable death in the United States, and cigarette smoking is a contributor to lung cancer in 80%–90% of cases. Though adult cigarette smoking rates have declined substantially during the past 50 years, they remain as high as 30% in certain groups, such as individuals living in poverty. Quitting is difficult: a given quit attempt results in cessation in fewer than 10% of cases, and most adult cigarette smokers have attempted and failed to quit, and often many times. What is urgently needed are novel interventions for cigarette smoking cessation that operate through different mechanisms from those targeted by existing interventions, which are likely to have been unsuccessful for persistent smokers. A barrier to progress is that the mechanisms of action of most treatments are not known, which makes it difficult to know which treatment will work best for whom. We turn to affective science to identify a candidate technique that could serve as the basis for a novel intervention. Research on affect regulation typically focuses on down- regulation of affective states, such as craving for cigarettes, using effortful strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. However, a new insight in affect regulation is that people can construe, or subjectively understand, events with varying levels of abstraction, and that construing health-related behaviors in high- versus low-level terms promotes health behavior in several domains. For example, smokers who want to quit are more likely to resist a cigarette when they construe the same event (e.g., “abstinence”) in more abstract, high-level terms (e.g., “becoming a better me”) versus more concrete, low-level terms (e.g., “not smoking this cigarette”). There is some evidence that high-level construal might rely on distinct mechanisms from traditional affect regulation and smoking reduction interventions, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. Directly comparing its mechanisms to those of alternative affect regulation strategies and developing tools to induce high-level construal are the next steps on the path toward developing a novel intervention. Also, establishing individual differences in the effects of high-level construal will allow future interventions to be targeted to the individuals for whom they will be maximally effective. We identified two candidate mechanisms through which high-level construal might operate: down-regulation of craving and up-regulation of goal energization (i.e., motivation to quit). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed the neural systems engaged by those processes to be distinct. So, we will use multivariate analyses of fMRI data to quantify the similarity of high-level construal to each candidate (Aim 1). This will be done in a longitudinal translational experiment with 4 conditions—high- level construal, down-regulation of craving, up-regulation of goal energization, and treatment-as-usual—in a sample of persistent smokers in poverty, who are the most likely to benefit from a novel, theory-based treatment. The sample size (N = 240) affords an examination of individual differences in the effect of high-level construal on neural activity and craving, and the degree to which they predict smoking reduction (Aim 2). 8. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking is among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States because smoking increases risk for lung cancer and various diseases. Though U.S. smoking rates have declined, a substantial percentage of adults, particularly those living in poverty who have repeatedly tried and failed to quit, still smoke and therefore could benefit from novel interventions for cessation that operate through different mechanisms than those of traditional treatments. This study will use neuroimaging to uncover the mechanisms of action of a promising strategy for affect regulation and smoking cessation and also build profiles of individuals for whom this strategy does and does not work, thereby providing tangible and practical information that public health professionals and clinicians can use to inform personalized treatments for cigarette smoking cessation.",Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control,10127602,R01CA240452,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medial', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cigarette craving', 'cigarette smoking', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cost', 'craving', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'insight', 'lens', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'preventable death', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,595543
"Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of this study is to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that link acute alcohol intoxication with cigarette use in young nondaily smokers (ages 21-25). Nondaily smokers experience fewer symptoms of cigarette withdrawal than daily smokers; however, they still experience difficulty quitting. Since smoking cessation before the age of 30 substantially attenuates the long-term health consequences associated with smoking, understanding the factors that motivate cigarette use in young nondaily smokers and developing tailored interventions will be critical for curbing cigarette use and improving public health. The proposed project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how acute alcohol intoxication impacts brain function and will assess the extent to which alcohol-induced changes in brain function correlate with impulsive choice, cigarette craving, and craving regulation in young adults. Furthermore, we will assess how alcohol-induced changes in brain function, impulsivity, craving, and capacity for craving regulation predict cigarette use over the course of 1 year.  This K01 application advances the PI's long-term research goal of establishing an independent line of research examining neurobiological markers that confer risk for future substance use disorder using multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The proposed training plan will enable the PI to develop skills and expertise in five primary areas: 1) design and implementation of longitudinal studies, 2) task-based and resting- state fMRI, 3) advanced statistical methods, 4) the assessment of acute neurobiological responses to drugs and 5) the neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive choice. The training program combines formal coursework with mentorship from experienced consultants who are experts in the proposed areas of training. This project will leverage the intellectual and institutional support at OHSU and in Dr. Nagel's Developmental Brain Imaging Laboratory in order to develop a new line of research that will form the foundation for a career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although rates of cigarette use are declining, the proportion of nondaily smokers is rising, particularly among young adults. Among young adults, nondaily smoking is associated with negative health consequences and, for some, may lead to the establishment of life-long smoking patterns. The goal of this project is to understand the behavioral, psychological and neurobiological factors that contribute to cigarette use in nondaily smokers to aid the development of tailored evidence-based interventions.",Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers,10125984,K01DA046649,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Beverages', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cigarette', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol response', 'base', 'career', 'cigarette craving', 'cigarette smoking', 'craving', 'design', 'discounting', 'drinking', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'problem drinker', 'psychologic', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking intervention', 'statistical and machine learning', 'therapeutic target', 'young adult']",NIDA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,183179
"Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores PROJECT SUMMARY The key appeal of polygenic risk scores (PRS) is the provision of individual-level estimates of genetic liability to complex disease. These proxies of genetic liability enable a raft of applications across clinical and basic research settings. However, while PRS are set to play a pivotal role in the future of biomedical research, their present formulation is suboptimal since it fails to directly account for substructure in genetic disease risk. The overarching goal of our proposal is to introduce a new generation of pathway-specific PRS, informed by biological function. Rather a single genome-wide PRS for each individual, they will have a set of k PRS over k pathways. Pathways will be defined according to multiscale integration of ‘omics data, exploiting co-expression networks, the transcriptome and the epigenome. The key deliverable from this project will be the production of a powerful and comprehensive pathway-specific PRS computational tool, PRSet, informed by biological function. The rationale is that PRS calculated for individuals by aggregating the effects of all risk variants genome-wide, results in a loss of vital individual-level information. Providing pathway-specific estimates of genetic liability, computed in a scalable, statistically rigorous way, informed by latest multi-omic data, could enable researchers to better decompose heterogenous complex disease, identify key pathways that explain overlap or differences among disorders, and explain problems of portability of PRS between and within populations. Applying our pathway-specific PRS tool, we seek to stratify patients into more homogenous subgroups by their liability over key pathways. We will use PRSet for stratification in three ways: (i) stratifying within SCZ/BiP, testing if liability over different pathways forms multiple routes to disease, (ii) differentiating between SCZ and BiP, testing if key pathways differentiate these highly overlapping disorders, (iii) testing whether variation in treatment response can be explained by pathway liability. Such stratification could help explain past successes, failures and adverse-effects in clinical trials, and provide new therapeutic targets tailored to subsets of patients. Our proposal is significant because the burgeoning application of PRS means that any advance in the PRS approach will have immediate, high impact across psychiatric research. Pathway-specific PRS could open-up routes to hypotheses that cannot be answered by genome-wide PRS. If PRSet reveals that genetic liability is more stratified than presently modelled, then this would call for a focus on pathways and their multi-omic integration, paving a new path towards precision medicine. Our proposal is innovative because we develop the first pathway-specific, function-informed, PRS tool, we propose that disease risk may be influenced by multiple genetic liabilities, and we stratify patients according to pathway-specific genetic risk for the first time. In conclusion, our proposal delivers a tool for the field to perform powerful pathway PRS analyses, better understand genetic liability to disease, and which may offer a more direct route to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are set to play a key role in advancing our understanding of the etiology and treatment of disease. While the application of genome-wide PRS is burgeoning across biomedical research, we propose that pathway-specific PRS have even greater potential to provide etiological insights and will help pave the way to precision medicine. Here we introduce a new generation of pathway-specific polygenic risk scores, informed by biological function, and deliver a comprehensive computational tool for their analysis, applying it to perform patient stratification in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.","Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores",10136725,R01MH122866,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,635256
"Patient Oriented Research and Mentorship and Training in Functional Neuroimaging of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ABSTRACT  This K24 Mid-Career Investigator Career Development Award seeks support for training and mentorship for Christopher Pittenger, MD, Ph.D., a well-established, tenured Associate Professor in Psychiatry at Yale University, Director of the Yale OCD Research Clinic, and Assistant Chair for Translational Research in the Department of Psychiatry. Dr. Pittenger leads a robust patient-oriented research (POR) research program, which is integrated with his basic/translational lab-based research and has produced important new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings and novel treatment avenues for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS). Dr. Pittenger has a long-standing commitment to mentorship; most notably, he is Co-Director of the Neuroscience Research Training Program (NRTP), the research track within the Yale psychiatry residency.  The training plan supported by this grant will allow Dr. Pittenger to increase his skills in quantitative analysis, with a focus on advanced statistical methods and on the design and analysis of fMRI studies. These are areas in which he already has active research with expert collaborators; the aim of the proposed training plan is to enhance his own proficiency to make him a more effective collaborator and mentor in these important domains. Additional training is focused on his own abilities as a mentor and leader, with the goal of increasing his efficacy in the management of his own research groups and in effective and individualized mentorship. These training activities will take place in the context of two NIMH- funded research studies. The first, R01 MH116038, is a recently funded grant on which Dr. Pittenger is co-PI with his close collaborator Alan Anticevic and deploys cutting-edge imaging technology and data analysis approaches to examine brain network connectivity parallels and predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacotherapy in OCD. The second, R01 MH100068, is a grant with collaborator Michelle Hampson that is developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a probe and potential treatment for OCD, with promising early results. These two exciting projects provide a fruitful vehicle for the proposed training in statistics and neuroimaging.  Dr. Pittenger will devote substantial time to mentoring under this award. One major focus will be the NRTP; the plan is for him to take over as Director of this program over the next few years, and to take the lead in the next resubmission of our T32 grant in 2022.

"Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry - Study Sites Abstract/Summary Globally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) outrank infectious diseases in terms of public health burden. Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death worldwide. In this application we will explore the genomic risk for common CMD, including hypertension, stroke, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and kidney disease, and related traits (including BMI, blood pressure, lipid, glucose, insulin and creatine) across populations with African ancestry (AA). There is evidence to suggest that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) translate poorly from a discovery study in one ancestral population (e.g. European Americans) to a target population (e.g. sub-Saharan Africans), especially when they are separated by large genetic differences. However, this has not been evaluated with large, well-powered AA datasets. Furthermore, the high genetic diversity and population structure among non-European Ancestry (EA) populations need to be investigated to understand the performance of PRSs in other regions populated by people with diverse genomic backgrounds. We bring together the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Consortium (H3Africa), other African, Jamaican and African American core cohorts, to develop a joint resource of over 50,000 participants with relevant phenotype and genomics data, referred to as the CARdiometabolic Disorders IN African-ancestry PopuLations (CARDINAL) Study Site. In addition, the CARDINAL Study Site will include 5 replication cohorts with >100,000 participants from diverse ancestry populations. Our main objective is to establish a Study Site for PRS Methods and Analysis for AA Populations and to collaboratively generate and refine PRS for other populations of diverse ancestry by integrating existing datasets with genomics and phenotype data for a range of complex diseases and traits. Our first aim is to integrate phenotype and genomic datasets from ~50,000 African individuals from seven individual cohort studies. Subsequently, we will evaluate PRSs and develop a novel method that takes into consideration, ancestry-specific genomic regions to improve prediction of PRSs in populations characterised by genetic sub-structure. Finally, we will develop an interactive dashboard for dissemination of PRS-related data from diverse ancestry populations. CARDINAL Study Site is ideal for generating novel biologic insights into complex disease etiology, with applications in global populations. Members of the CARDINAL team have successfully worked together for about a decade, generating and disseminating scientific knowledge through high impact publications. By establishing a Study Site in the Polygenic Risk Score Diversity Consortium, CARDINAL brings the largest cohort of African-ancestry participants to the table, to explore the genomics contribution to common CMDs and other NCDs. Narrative Cardiometabolic diseases are on the increase worldwide, contributing to high levels of morbidity and mortality, with limited resources among lower-resource populations in North America and Africa to prevent disease, make diagnosis and clinically manage patients. In this study we bring together ~50,000 African-ancestry participants (African American, Jamaicans and continental African) to form the CARDINAL study to assess and develop polygenic risk scores for cardiometabolic diseases and traits, and to develop analytic approaches for multi-ethnic cohorts leveraging the increased genetic diversity and lower linkage disequilibrium in African genomes. This research will lead to a better understanding of the transferability of polygenic risk scores from discovery to target populations of different ethnicities, informing prevention and diagnostic strategies that could contribute to the development of effective public health policies.",Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry - Study Sites,10212798,U01HG011717,"['Admixture', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Creatine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Funding', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heredity', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Jamaican', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Lipids', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'North America', 'Northern Africa', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'dashboard', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'data standards', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'improved', 'insight', 'interactive tool', 'lifestyle data', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'population stratification', 'prevent', 'tool', 'trait', 'working group']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,U01,2021,958531
"Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats Project Summary (Overall)  The purpose of this renewal application is to continue the successful activities of our center, which uses quantitative genetic techniques to study the genetic basis of drug abuse-related behaviors in outbred rats. When our center was initially funded in June 2014, our goal was to develop outbred N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as a platform for genetic studies of behaviors that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. The first four years of funding have allowed us to establish a vibrant community of investigators using HS rats to study drug abuse and other traits, which we refer to as an ecosystem. This ecosystem includes both the investigators who are directly involved in this renewal application and many others who have obtained separate funding, some from NIDA, and some from other sources. The growth of this ecosystem reflects one of the ways that our center has served as national resource. We are proposing three projects that involved phenotyping HS rats for a variety of traits, including intravenous cocaine and nicotine self-administration, response to novelty, social behavior, reaction time, and delay discounting. Two of those projects are continuations from the prior funding period and are designed to increase our sample size from 1,600 to 3,200 rats per phenotype. We present data showing that such an increase produces an exponential increase in the number of significant findings. This approach parallels human genetics studies of SUD, which have also benefited tremendously from larger sample sizes. We will use these data to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a suite of related techniques. In addition, we will measure gene expression in behaviorally naïve rats using RNASeq and use those data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate GWAS and eQTL data in an effort to identify specific genes that influence the behavioral phenotypes. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also study genetic correlations, perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) and explore a novel strategy called polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS), that is intended to allow translation of polygenic signals across species. Project 4 will use a network-based approach to extend our GWAS to account for known biological networks. This proposed renewal also includes a pilot project core to support new directions and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. Finally we propose an administrative core that supports many activities of the center, including educational, career development and public outreach. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genes in a range of psychologically complex behaviors and will provide novel biological insights that may support future efforts at preventing or treating drug abuse. Project Narrative (Overall)  Using powerful genetic, molecular and statistical techniques, we will study the genetic basis of traits that have well-established relevance to drug abuse. We expect that these studies will enhance our understanding of drug abuse and lead to the identification of specific genes and pathways. These discoveries will improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to drug abuse in humans and may identify new opportunities to treat psychiatric disorders including but not limited to addiction.",Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats,10160842,P50DA037844,"['Adolescent', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crime', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Esthesia', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Individual', 'Intravenous', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Network-based', 'Nicotine', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Self Administration', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Reinforcement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'cocaine self-administration', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'discounting', 'drug abuse related behavior', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'premature', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P50,2021,3009655

"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,10294298,R00DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2021,248999
"Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments Project Summary: My goal is to build an independent research program in the development of causal inference methods for investigating environmental causes of childhood cancer. This K01 will enable me to conduct the focused, intensive research that will lay the groundwork for that program and to acquire the environmental, biological, and epidemiological training needed to maximize the rigor and impact of my work. Research: We propose to develop new causal machine learning (ML) methods that enable rigorous analysis of environmental natural experiments (NE) for estimation of the causal effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer. Classical approaches to studying relationships between environmental exposures and childhood cancer are plagued with challenges and are yielding inconsistent findings. We contend that the recent proliferation of local environmental regulatory programs has created ample relevant NEs, which provide a powerful alternative approach to study these relationships. However, existing methods for NE analysis are poorly-suited for environmental health contexts. In particular, existing methods fail in the presence of rare outcomes like childhood cancer (Aim 1), and they are not able to provide insight into the timing at which children are most susceptible to any adverse exposure effects (Aim 2). We propose causal ML methods that overcome these challenges and apply them to a NE to study the effects of traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia. We also provide open source software implementing these methods (Aim 3). Career Development and Training: Given my extensive prior training and experience in statistics and data science, the primary aim of the training funded by this award will be the acquisition of subject-matter proficiency, which will provide me with the insights needed to create more effective and impactful environmental health methods. Specifically, I will pursue knowledge in the biology and epidemiology of childhood cancer and in environmental health and exposure biology. The training will be achieved through a combination of (1) hands-on collaborative research as described above; (2) intensive cross-disciplinary mentorship, with mentors specializing in environmental health, pediatric oncology, cancer biology and epidemiology, and statistics; (3) carefully-selected coursework in the Departments of Epidemiology, Environmental Health, and Cell Biology at Harvard; and (4) relevant conferences, workshops, and seminars. I will place special emphasis on establishing a network of expert collaborators in all my areas of training. Environment: The Harvard Medical Campus is home to the top research teams worldwide in both childhood cancer and environmental health. Due to Harvard’s position at the forefront of scientific discovery in these fields, its unparalleled resources, its vibrant intellectual atmosphere, and its promotion of collaborative science that integrates knowledge across disciplines, it provides an ideal environment in which to train on these topics. Project Narrative: Decades of research on the relationship between environmental exposures and childhood cancer, relying on classic epidemiologic study designs, has produced a largely inconclusive body of literature, and has generated little robust, actionable evidence to protect children’s health. We propose an alternative methodological approach to this problem, which relies on environmental natural experiments to overcome many of the challenges presented by classic approaches. We develop causal machine learning methods tailored to this setting, which provide a promising new avenue for obtaining robust evidence about environmental causes of childhood cancer, and we apply the methods to study the effects of exposure to traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia.",Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments,10104187,K01ES032458,"['1,3-Butadiene', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Benzene', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gasoline', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Work', 'cancer epidemiology', 'career development', 'educational atmosphere', 'environmental agent', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'health application', 'health data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'open source', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2021,138538

Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,10137788,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'structured data', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,176541
"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation. If successful, this intervention can be cost-effectively scaled on a population level, thereby making a high public health impact.",Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation,10120658,R01CA247156,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antismoking', 'Car Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Cost Measures', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empathy', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Health behavior change', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social support', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Trust', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'patient engagement', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized effectiveness trial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'sex', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'text messaging intervention', 'web site']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,730398
"Novel imaging genetic biomarkers for sporadic frontotemporal dementia through machine learning Project Summary This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Iris Broce-Diaz, a neuroimaging genetics postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Diego and University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Broce-Diaz is establishing herself as a young imaging geneticist conducting clinical research on neurodegenerative disease. This K01 will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) gain proficiency in machine learning and computational modeling techniques, (2) gain proficiency in clinical and genetic research methodology for cognitive aging and complex spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including clinical characterization of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias, differential diagnosis, risk prediction, and biomarker development, and (3) develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Broce-Diaz has assembled an expert mentoring team, including her primary mentors: Dr Anders Dale (renowned computational neuroimaging genetics scientist) and co-primary mentor Bruce Miller (internationally recognized behavioral neurologist and leader in FTD), co-mentors: Drs. Jennifer Yokoyama (expert in FTD genetics) and Chun Chieh Fan (expert in epidemiology/biostatistics), and two collaborators: Drs. Adam Boxer (leader in clinical trials for FTD-spectrum disorders) and Wesley Thompson (expert in advanced statistics). The goal of the proposed project is to develop novel imaging genetics biomarkers for predicting individuals at risk of developing sporadic (non-familial) FTD and improving classification accuracy of sporadic FTD. Dr. Broce- Diaz will achieve this goal through the following specific aims: (1a) utilize a polygenic hazard approach to develop and validate a novel genetic biomarker for predicting age-specific risk of sporadic FTD; (1b) leverage pleiotropic information to increase accuracy of the genetic risk scores and derive biologically-based genetic risk scores; (2) use machine learning approaches to reliably and accurately classify FTD clinical subtypes and obtain personalized atrophy scores from these brain maps; and (3) improve FTD classification by integrating atrophy scores with genetic risk scores. This proposed study uses highly innovative methodological approaches for informing FTD prognosis, diagnosis, and, ultimately, clinical trial design. If validated, these biomarkers will make significant contributions by assisting clinicians in identifying patients at elevated risk for sporadic FTD and assisting in diagnosing sporadic FTD in its earliest stages—reducing diagnostic delays, accelerating the discovery of novel treatments, and improving recruitment accuracy in clinical trials. This K01 research project will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the protected research time and opportunity to train with leaders in the field she needs to master the skills required to establish an independent, patient-oriented, imaging genetics and biomarker development clinical research program that will inform diagnosis, prognosis, and guide treatments of FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Narrative The development and validation of predictive models is a critical step toward improving strategies for an early diagnosis of sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other neurodegenerative diseases and improving strategies for personalized treatment. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel imaging genetic biomarkers that can help clinicians with an early and accurate diagnosis and prognosis of sporadic FTD. This project is highly relevant to the NIA’s mission because it supports the conduct of genetic, imaging, and clinical aging research and fosters the development of a clinical research scientist in aging.",Novel imaging genetic biomarkers for sporadic frontotemporal dementia through machine learning,10106384,K01AG070376,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atrophic', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive aging', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Iris', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Social Behavior', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'genetic variant', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'model development', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'pleiotropism', 'polygenic risk score', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tool']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2021,120420
"Merging machine learning and mechanistic models to improve prediction and inference in emerging epidemics PROJECT SUMMARY When an outbreak of an established or emerging infectious disease occurs we ask a standard set of questions that are critical to a lifesaving public health response: Where will future incidence occur? How many cases will there be? And where can we most effectively intervene? The proposed research is motivated by real world instances where answering these questions was critical to making practical public health decisions, and current methods came up short: from deciding if and where to build additional Ebola Treatment Units in the 2014-15 West African Ebola epidemic, to identifying priority districts where oral cholera vaccine should be used in the 2016-17 cholera outbreak in Yemen, to picking locations where sufficient cases might occur to selecting and prioritizing interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. Forecasts informing such decisions are typically generated either using an epidemic model that relies on knowledge of the disease transmission mechanism and epidemic theory or using a statistical model to project the expected number of cases based on the relationship between covariates and observed counts. However, both approaches are subject to limitations, particularly early in an epidemic when few cases are observed. This project is based on the overarching scientific premise that inferences that combine the strengths of mechanistic epidemic models and statistical covariate models will substantially outperform either approach alone in forecasting and making decisions to confront emerging infectious disease threats. Specifically, this project aims to (1) Develop a framework to forecast incidence in ongoing outbreaks that merges mechanistic and machine learning approaches; (2) Validate the framework using retrospective data and apply the framework to inform decision making in emerging epidemics; (3) Integrate this inferential forecasting framework into causal decision theory to optimize critical actions in the public health response to emerging epidemics; and (4) Develop accessible and extensible tools for forecasting and decision analysis in infectious disease epidemics. We will validate these approaches using rigorous simulation studies and by applying the proposed approaches to retrospective data from important recent epidemics (e.g., Ebola, Cholera and COVID-19, as mentioned above). We will prospectively apply our approach to inform the response to emerging disease threats that occur during the project period, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure that the tools developed are useful, efficient, and user friendly, we will work with international humanitarian organizations responding to epidemics. Successful completion of these aims will provide a flexible and validated framework for forecasting and decision making during ongoing epidemics, while allowing for innovation in mechanistic and statistical approaches. In doing so it will provide tools to optimize responses and reduce morbidity and mortality during public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of the proposed project is to improve inference, forecasting and decision making in response to emerging infectious diseases by developing a framework to integrate mechanistic and statistical approaches to epidemic modeling and causal inference. Approaches developed will be validated using simulations and retrospective data and applied prospectively to reduce morbidity and mortality in emerging public health crises. Further, they will be incorporated into publically available tools for use in epidemic response.",Merging machine learning and mechanistic models to improve prediction and inference in emerging epidemics,10142638,R01GM140564,"['African', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Community Health', 'Cost utility', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ebola', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fogs', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Liberia', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Oral', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Update', 'War', 'Work', 'Yemen', 'base', 'case-based', 'curve fitting', 'dashboard', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'surveillance data', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,429701
"2021 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Investigative Pathology The purpose of this proposal is to seek support for the 2021 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Investigative Pathology (ASIP), which will be held in conjunction with the Experimental Biology 2021 conference from May 1-4 using a virtual meeting platform. ASIP’s Annual Meeting provides a unique forum for presentation and sharing of cutting-edge research in experimental pathology. The target audience and subject matter for the meeting are diverse but united by a common focus on mechanisms of disease. The theme of the ASIP 2021 Annual Meeting is ‘From microbiota to artificial intelligence: emerging technologies and approaches for discovering mechanisms of pathobiology.’ Reflecting the interests of the ASIP membership, the 2021 Annual Meeting contains strong components in neoplasia and precision medicine. Major sessions will focus on the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer; hepatic tumorigenesis; epigenetic regulation in cancer; single-cell transcriptome and epigenome analysis; precision oncology; new technologies in precision medicine; and progress in the use of big data and artificial intelligence to understand mechanisms of disease. Application of insights gained from basic research to therapy and prevention will be a particular focus throughout the meeting. The four-day program comprises symposia, workshops, and lectures by award recipients, as well as abstract-driven minisymposia and poster sessions. The program further provides a number of educational initiatives, both targeted and of interest to the biomedical research community as a whole. These include sessions on diverse career paths in the biomedical sciences; preparation for the first faculty position; and creation of individual development plans. The ASIP regards promotion of the career development of trainee and young investigators as an extremely important aspect of the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, the meeting provides not only special events designed for their needs but also sessions that showcase their work. Similarly, the Program Committee works hard to ensure diversity among the participants with respect to gender, ethnic/racial group, and stage of career. The sole specific aim of this application is to promote the participation of trainees in the 2021 Annual Meeting through provision of a trainee scholar award program targeted to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and clinical residents and fellows in pathology. The Annual Meeting of the American Society for Investigative Pathology offers a unique forum for the sharing of original research results related to a wide spectrum of human diseases and disorders, with particular emphasis on the development, treatment, and prevention of cancer. Such sharing fosters more rapid advances in the understanding of human diseases such as cancer and accelerates the rate at which this knowledge can be applied to the development of diagnostic and prognostic tests, as well as targeted therapies. A major goal of the meeting is to provide educational and career support to young investigators who are interested in cancer biology and experimental pathobiology.",2021 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Investigative Pathology,10231963,R13CA260876,"['American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biochemistry', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Educational workshop', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Pathology', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Individual', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Neoplasms', 'Organoids', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pharmaceutical Societies', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Program Development', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Societies', 'Special Event', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'breast cancer progression', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'design', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'lectures', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'member', 'microbiota', 'new technology', 'posters', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'prognostic assays', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis', 'virtual']",NCI,AMERICAN SOCIETY/INVESTIGATIVE PATHOLOGY,R13,2021,12500

"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health.

"Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY This application is for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington and affiliated institutions. This Center has over the past 25 years provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D). Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services. In coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, we will support a new Geropathology Research initiative. UW NATHAN SHOCK CENTER OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We apply for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington, which has for 25 years provided key resources supporting investigators who study the biology of aging. The overarching goal of this Center is to have a positive impact on the field by accelerating research discovery and providing research support for investigators nationally and internationally, particularly junior investigators in the process of building their own research programs. We will accomplish this goal through six cores that function synergistically together: four Resource Cores with particular expertise in protein (Core C) and metabolite (Core D) phenotypes of aging, invertebrate longevity and healthspan phenotypes (Core E) and artificial intelligence and bioinformatics (Core F), along with a Research Development Core (Core B) that supports external pilot projects and junior faculty studies, and an Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) that supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, sponsorship and organization of national meetings and pre-meetings, courses, workshops and seminars, and, in coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, a Geropathology Research initiative.",Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10260476,P30AG013280,"['Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology of Aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Faculty', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Gerontology', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Office of Administrative Management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell age', 'computerized tools', 'data dissemination', 'data sharing', 'healthspan', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'outreach', 'outreach services', 'programs', 'protein metabolite', 'research and development', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P30,2021,962037
"Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders supports a full day of presentations by leading scientists in areas that are having transformational effects in the communication sciences and disorders (CSD) discipline. The Research Symposium is held at the annual Convention of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and is open to all of the approximately 15,000 Convention attendees, which includes students, practitioners, and researchers. Following Convention, the Symposium content is widely disseminated through audio recordings of the presentations, which are synced with the slides and transcribed, and by making them freely accessible on the ASHA website. Additionally, each presenter submits an article based on their presentation to the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research to be published in the annual Research Symposium Forum. An innovation that will be implemented in this current funding cycle is that ASHA will make these articles freely accessible upon publication on the ASHA Journals website and will deposit them in PubMed Central without embargo. The first aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance scientific discourse and dissemination of scientific discovery and innovation on five topics that are having transformational effects across several subareas in CSD. This will be accomplished, in part, by making the Research Symposium Forum open access and by widely promoting both the recorded and the written content across ASHA’s many communication channels. Over the next 5-year funding cycle, the Symposium will address five topics that cut across the areas of hearing, speech, language, and other aspects of cognition, including (1) Health and Healthcare Equity of People With Communication Disabilities, (2) Bilingualism, (3) Artificial Intelligence in CSD, (4) Genetics in CSD, and (5) Intervention and Implementation Clinical Trials in CSD. The second aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance the research career development of early- career scientists focused on research in CSD. Between 2021 and 2025, the Research Mentoring- Pair Travel Award and ASHA’s in-kind contribution will provide funding to attend the Symposium and mentoring support to 130 early-career scientists in CSD. The Travel Award recipients will attend the Symposium along with a mentor and engage in mentored research activities before, during, and after each Symposium. These activities are designed to help integrate the protégés into their scientific community and encourage them to pursue a research career and become productive scholars. The scientific base of the CSD discipline will be strengthened by these scientific dissemination, research education, and mentoring activities. The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders aims to strengthen the scientific base and increase the research capacity of the discipline, which will lead to improvements in the communication health of millions people with communication or related disorders. The Symposium presentations will advance the scientific dialogue and be broadly disseminated through freely available peer-reviewed publications and transcribed recordings. The associated Travel Award will provide funds to support 130 promising early-career scientists in attending the Research Symposium and engaging in mentored research activities before, during, after the Symposium to increase their recruitment and retention in a research career.",Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders,10070224,R13DC003383,"['Address', 'American Speech-Language-Hearing Association', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communication Disability', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Degree program', 'Deposition', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Outcome Measure', 'Peer Review', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Slide', 'Speech', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical trial implementation', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'doctoral student', 'education research', 'experience', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'online community', 'recruit', 'social media', 'stem', 'symposium', 'web site']",NIDCD,AMERICAN SPEECH-LANGUAGE-HEARING ASSN,R13,2021,39900
"Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy This K24 grant will provide the PI, Dr. Lin Yee Chen, a midcareer NIH-funded patient-oriented research (POR) investigator, with the protected time and support needed to (1) accelerate his current trajectory in mentoring junior clinicians and investigators who are conducting POR in cardiovascular (CV) science, (2) acquire additional training in mentoring methods, machine learning, and omics science, (3) promote his current research that aims to define the mechanisms underlying the relationship of the abnormal atrial substrate—atrial cardiomyopathy—and atrial fibrillation (AF) to ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes. Trainees in his AF Clinical Research Group will be recruited from the NIH-funded T32 training programs in the University of Minnesota's Division of Cardiology, Division of Epidemiology, and Division of Biostatistics; Department of Medicine Physician Scientist Training Program; KL2 and TL1 Programs of the CTSI; and graduate programs (MS in Clinical Research, MPH, and PhD) in the School of Public Health. For his career development, Dr. Chen will hone his mentoring skills and learn new skills in cutting-edge areas (machine learning and omics science) through focused study, selected coursework, seminars, and guidance from senior collaborators with domain expertise. Finally, this grant will support a research project that is based on the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, which extends Dr. Chen’s ongoing work to elucidate the role of atrial cardiomyopathy in driving AF-related outcomes. The specific aims are: (1) Identify atrial cardiomyopathy subtypes by using machine learning approaches to analyze the extensive data at ARIC Visit 5 (2011-13): clinical, 2D-echocardiographic, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, ECG, and multi-omics data, (2) Evaluate association of subtypes with ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes, and (3) Discover specific risk factors for subtypes by analyzing risk factor measures collected at Visits 1-4 (1987-98). Crucially, findings will be validated in 2 independent community-based cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). This project has significant impact: (1) This K24 grant will provide the PI with the protected time to enhance his current mentoring of trainees involved in POR. By assembling a team of senior collaborators that comprise experts in mentoring, data science, and molecular epidemiology, the PI provides an outstanding platform for his mentees to acquire cutting-edge skills in POR, (2) By resolving heterogeneity in atrial cardiomyopathy, the team will advance the NIH’s Precision Medicine initiative by personalizing current treatment for patients based on biological underpinnings, (3) The findings will lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in classification of stroke risk in patients with AF, which will improve patient outcomes, (4) By efficiently leveraging existing resources of deeply phenotyped NHLBI cohorts, this project will fill critical knowledge gaps in prevention and treatment, thus achieving a sustained and powerful impact on CV public health, clinical practice, and education of the next generation of researchers in POR. The abnormal atrial substrate (atrial cardiomyopathy) is associated with elevated risks of ischemic stroke dementia, and other cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure. Progress in preventing these adverse outcomes has been hampered by unresolved heterogeneity underlying atrial cardiomyopathy; hence, this K24 grant will support a project that will use machine learning and dense phenotypic data to identify clinically relevant subtypes of atrial cardiomyopathy. Additionally, this K24 grant will foster a supportive environment for the mentoring of junior investigators involved in patient-oriented research and facilitate acquisition of new cutting-edge skills by the PI and his mentees.",Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy,10307378,K24HL155813,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Atrial Function', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'aptamer', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'exome', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rate variability', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'patient oriented research', 'phenotypic data', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'stroke risk', 'supportive environment', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,K24,2021,126631
"Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use Project Summary Although enormous progress has been made in reducing cigarette smoking in the United States, large disparities remain across subpopulations such as racial minorities. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of disease and early death. However, African Americans (AA) are less likely to quit smoking successfully than are non-Hispanic Whites, and they are also three times more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than Whites. There is a remarkable variation in the incidence of lung cancer due to cigarette smoking among racial/ethnic groups in the United States, and African Americans have significantly greater risks than Whites at lower levels of smoking. Tobacco use landscape is changing among U.S. adults with an estimated 4.5% of adults aged 18 years and older reporting current use of electronic cigarettes (EC). Evidence suggests that e-cigarette aerosol is substantially less toxic than combustible cigarette smoking, but e-cigarette use may also post elevated risk for former smokers to relapse back to combustible cigarette smoking. Biomarker can play an important role in assessing the potential health effects of tobacco products and studies have found that AA have higher levels of serum cotinine per cigarette smoked, higher urinary amount of TNE and NNAL than Whites. However, evidence on the racial disparities of biomarker outcomes of EC use is scarce, especially whether and to what extent they are different from use of various EC devices, flavors, and transitions in EC ↔ cigarettes. The overarching goal of this study is to examine the racial disparities in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants in association with EC use by analyzing the restricted Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Wave 1-4 biomarker data. We will link the biomarker data with the PATH adult surveys to identify the between- person and within-person differences in biomarkers by use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition in EC and combustible cigarettes across different waves (Aim 1). We will further leverage machine learning algorithms to develop a composite bio (biomarker)-socio (socio-demographics) -psycho (psychosocial factors) risk index score for each racial/ethnic group to predict subsequent abstinence from cigarette smoking and relapse to cigarette smoking since these 2 outcomes represent the most meaningful transitions from a public health perspective. This study is innovative in its focus on racial disparities of biomarkers by leveraging the nationally longitudinal data, and on using machine learning algorithms to predict future smoking cessation and relapse behaviors in EC ↔ cigarette transition. Fulfillment of these aims will build a scientific base for maximizing the value of existing biospecimen collections. Findings from this R21 study are expected to inform regulatory strategies to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and set the stage for a future R01 application that will develop personalized intervention strategies that incorporate biomarker measures to reduce racial disparities in tobacco use and improve health outcomes. 1 Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine racial disparities in biomarkers of e-cigarette use by linking the PATH Waves 1-4 restricted biomarker data and adult survey data. The study will extend our knowledge on the heterogeneity in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants across racial and ethnic groups, including use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition between e-cigarettes and cigarettes. We will further develop a bio-socio-psycho risk index score to predict abstinence from cigarette smoking, relapse to cigarette use, and tobacco-related health outcomes using machine learning algorithms across racial and ethnic groups.","Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use",10232728,R21DA054818,"['18 year old', '4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol', 'Abstinence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Cotinine', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Menthol', 'Metals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nicotine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cigarette smoke', 'cigarette smoking', 'cigarette user', 'combustible cigarette', 'disorder risk', 'e-cigarette aerosols', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'former smoker', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'personalized intervention', 'psychosocial', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial minority', 'reduce tobacco use', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'sociodemographics', 'tobacco exposure', 'tobacco products', 'tobacco toxicant', 'toxicant', 'urinary', 'vaping']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,204739
"Advanced Training at the Interface of Engineering and Oral-Craniofacial Sciences Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Oral diseases and disorders in the craniofacial complex disproportionally and devastatingly afflict susceptible populations, particularly impoverished families and medically or physically compromised persons. Novel engineering approaches, properly leveraged, can yield new paradigms to reveal disease mechanism, new strategies for disease mitigation, and new approaches for affordable/personalized therapies for dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and needs; all must be aware of the complex clinical and regulatory landscapes. To address this urgent need, we propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician. Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1) engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees, tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3) principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program, unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Advances in engineering approaches offer previously unimagined opportunities to advance the NIDCR 2030 vision of precision oral health for all. To harness this opportunity, a critical mass of cross-trained dentists and engineers engaged in oral and craniofacial research are urgently needed. We will develop this workforce.

"Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, LDs take on a higher risk of future ESKD themselves. African American (AA) LDs have an even greater, 3.3-fold, risk of ESKD than white LDs post-donation. Because evidence suggests that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants contribute to this greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly using APOL1 testing to evaluate LD candidates of African ancestry. However, nephrologists do not consistently perform genetic counseling with LD candidates about APOL1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in counseling about APOL1. Without proper counseling, APOL1 testing will magnify LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, jeopardizing their informed consent. Given their elevated risk of ESRD post-donation, and AAs’ widely-held cultural concerns about genetic testing, it is ethically critical to protect AA LD candidates’ safety through APOL1 testing in a culturally competent manner to improve informed decisions about donating.  No transplant programs have integrated APOL1 testing into LD evaluation in a culturally competent manner. Clinical “chatbots,” mobile apps that use artificial intelligence to provide genetic information to patients and relieve constraints on clinicians’ time, can improve informed treatment decisions and reduce decisional conflict. The chatbot “Gia,” created by a medical genetics company, can be adapted to any condition. However, no chatbot on APOL1 is currently available. No counseling training programs are available for nephrologists to counsel AA LDs about APOL1 and donation in a culturally competent manner. Given the shortage of genetic counselors, increasing nephrologists’ genetic literacy is critical to integrating genetic testing into practice.  The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of an APOL1 testing program for AA LDs at two transplant centers serving large AA LD populations (Chicago, IL, and Washington, DC). The APOL1 testing program will evaluate the effect of the culturally competent testing, chatbot, and counseling on AA LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making, willingness to donate, and satisfaction with informed consent. The specific aims are to: 1. Adapt Gia and transplant counseling to APOL1 for use in routine clinical practice 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on decisional conflict, preparedness, and willingness to  donate in a pre-post design 3. Evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice by using the RE-AIM framework to  longitudinally evaluate nephrologist counseling practices and LDs’ satisfaction with informed consent.  The impact of this study will be the creation of a model for APOL1 testing of AA LDs, which can then be implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. APOL1 will serve as a model for integrating culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other practices to improve patient informed consent. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants may contribute to African American living kidney donors’ even greater (3.3-fold) risk of end-stage renal disease post-donation than white living kidney donors. However, transplant physicians do not consistently use APOL1 genetic testing or counsel African American living donor candidates about APOL1, which may undermine candidates’ ability to give informed consent about donating and exacerbate health disparities in living donation and transplantation. By evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program, the proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly scale up APOL1 testing nationally as a novel and ethical approach to protect African American living donors’ safety and enhance their informed consent.",Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation,10180256,R01DK128207,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'African', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Altruism', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioethics', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Living Donors', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of life', 'Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance', 'Readiness', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'chatbot', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'implementation intervention', 'implementation outcomes', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'literacy', 'living kidney donor', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'success', 'transplant centers', 'willingness']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,714612
"Mentoring in patient-oriented atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular research PROJECT SUMMARY This application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Alvaro Alonso, with protected time and other support to (1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior clinical investigators and graduate students engaged in patient-oriented cardiovascular research; (2) obtain additional training in omics, machine learning, and mentoring best-practices; and (3) advance Dr. Alonso's ongoing research on the risk factors and mechanisms contributing to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Mentoring activities will build upon the ongoing involvement of Dr. Alonso in several training programs at Emory University, including an NHLBI-funded multidisciplinary T32 training grant on cardiovascular health disparities, the research-track Cardiology fellowship program at the School of Medicine, and the Master of Public Health and PhD programs in epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health. Training will focus on cutting-edge methodological areas in rapid development, including integration of omic technologies and machine learning in patient-oriented research, as well as acquisition of skills in academic, research, and clinical mentoring. Finally, this award will support a research project that extends Dr. Alonso's ongoing work on understanding the factors influencing the development of the AF substrate, understanding AF pathophysiology, and preventing AF-related outcomes. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to identify novel AF phenotypes (phenogroups) using extensive clinical and multi-omic data (“phenomapping”), (2) to discover specific risk factors for the different AF phenogroups, and (3) to determine associations of AF phenogroups with selected endpoints (stroke, heart failure, mortality). These research aims will be carried out in the context of the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, an ongoing prospective registry of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in three Emory-affiliated hospitals currently including approximately 7,000 unique individuals with detailed phenotyping, clinical outcomes, and multi-omic markers. In summary, the activities proposed in this application will favorably impact Dr. Alonso's capabilities to conduct cutting-edge and innovative patient-oriented research on cardiovascular prevention and his ability to perform as a highly qualified mentor for junior clinicians pursuing research on clinical cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite progress, atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia, remains a major public health program. This award will contribute to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of atrial fibrillation.

"Institutional Career Development Core The KL2 Mentored Clinical Scholars Program attracts a diverse group of highly talented junior faculty across multiple disciplines from across Yale University (Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Science) who will pursue careers in T1-T4 translational research. This Program has been extremely successful, attracting 151 Scholars who have authored >5200 publications, have been PIs on 258 NIH grants, and have received a total of $557 million in grant funding. Remarkably, 99% of our KL2 Scholars have attained positions in academia, industry or public health conducting, and often with leadership responsibilities for, clinical and translational research. We aim to build on this success by providing Scholars with individualized, competency-based training in translational research that prepares them to contribute to the learning healthcare system, to advance personalized health, and to address health disparities. This preparation includes training in clinical trials, big data, machine learning, bioinformatics, multidisciplinary translational research, team science, implementation science and community-based participatory research. It also introduces them to regulatory issues, bioethics, Good Clinical Practices, and factors that drive rigor, transparency, and replicability. The KL2 promotes the development of relevant competencies among the Scholars by providing: 1) opportunities to work successfully in complex and diverse multidisciplinary research teams, 2) access to mentorship by senior mentors and recent Clinical Scholars, 3) externships in industry, public health and regulatory agencies, and 4) intensive training in grant-writing and in multidisciplinary team science. To oversee these diverse, highly motivated junior investigators, we have an educational leadership team of: 1) three outstanding investigator mentors who work in different areas of translational research, 2) an experienced Diversity Officer, and 3) an expert in evaluating and dynamically reshaping medical education programs. This leadership team has used feedback from prior Scholars and their mentors to add new initiatives to the already successful program. We expanded our logic model to implement social network analyses to track the activities of the Scholars, and we will expand the curriculum to include a new course. That course will mix Scholars and TL-1 trainees who will work in teams as they get formal training and peer mentoring in a variety of areas such as big data/machine learning, diversity and inclusion, and running a research laboratory. With these additions to an already strong curriculum, we believe that the Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program will be ideally positioned to train the next generation of leaders in T1-T4 translational research who will transform healthcare in ways that alleviate the burden of disease and improve health in the US and around the world. The Specific Aims of the KL2 are: Aim 1: The Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program: To provide a program comprised of a mentored research experience, coursework, and seminars that are intended to promote the emergence of scientific independence and the career development of talented young T1-T4 translational scientist Scholars. Aim 2: The Yale Masters in Health Science Program: To provide those M.D. Scholars who do not possess an advanced research degree with additional coursework and scholarly activities to qualify for a Masters in Health Science (MHS) to address limitations in their scientific preparation for a research career. n/a",Institutional Career Development Core,10368487,KL2TR001862,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Good Clinical Practice', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Education', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Science', 'Social Network', 'Talents', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'community based participatory research', 'experience', 'externship', 'health disparity', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'peer coaching', 'programs', 'success', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,YALE UNIVERSITY,KL2,2021,1318718
"Experimentally guided modeling and simulation for cholera dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global pandemic at present. Quantitative research is urgently needed to clarify the impacts of the current vaccination campaign on the pandemic evolution and economic growth, and to guide future policy development. The overall objective of this proposal is to establish a new computational modeling framework for an investigation of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the US, and to incorporate real data to assess the impacts of COVID-19 vaccination on public health and the economy. To achieve this objective, the team will pursue three specific aims: (1) Modeling the transmission and spread of COVID-19 under the impact of vaccination; (2) Modeling the economic impact of COVID-19 vaccination; (3) Conducting a case study for the Chattanooga region in the state of Tennessee. The proposed research is significant because it will incorporate detailed characteristics and potential limitations of the current vaccination campaign (such as the vaccine efficacy, phased allocation schemes, public resistance to vaccination, and vaccine breakthrough due to new variants of SARS- CoV-2) into a sophisticated modeling framework, which will enable us to make more accurate forecasts on the progression and long-term evolution of the pandemic. As such, the project is expected to advance the current understanding of COVID-19 transmission and to quantify the interaction between epidemic spreading, economic growth, and disease prevention and intervention under the impact of COVID-19 vaccination, all of which are important for the control and management of the pandemic. The approach is innovative in the development of a computational framework that integrates novel mechanistic and machine learning models and that connects the epidemic and economic aspects of COVID-19. The innovation of this project is also reflected by the integration of sophisticated computational modeling, rigorous mathematical analysis, intensive numerical simulation, and detailed data validation. The project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration among an applied and computational mathematician with long-term interest in infectious disease modeling (Wang), an epidemiologist with extensive working experiences at CDC and a current member of the regional COVID-19 task force (Heath), a business and management professor with a background in public heath (Mullen), and a statistician with expertise in machine learning and biomedical data analytics (Ma). The success of this project will not only build a solid knowledge base for the complex transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 vaccination, but also provide important guidelines for the government agencies and public health administrations in pandemic management and policy development. Project Narrative The proposed project is relevant to public health because a deep understanding of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign and its health and economic impacts will help to inform the pandemic management and improve the current practice in disease prevention and intervention. The mathematical and machine learning models developed in this project will improve such understanding and make new knowledge discovery. This research effort aligns with part of NIH's mission to reduce public health burdens of infectious diseases.",Experimentally guided modeling and simulation for cholera dynamics,10376956,R15GM131315,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Attention', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 vaccination', 'Case Study', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Country', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Economic Factors', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Policy Developments', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Administration', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Route', 'SARS-CoV-2 transmission', 'SARS-CoV-2 variant', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Solid', 'Techniques', 'Tennessee', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Unemployment', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'computer framework', 'disorder prevention', 'dynamic system', 'economic impact', 'economic indicator', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health economics', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'professor', 'programs', 'simulation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'vaccine efficacy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE CHATTANOOGA,R15,2021,122580
