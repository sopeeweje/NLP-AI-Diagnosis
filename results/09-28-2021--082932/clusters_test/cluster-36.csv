"Integrating Pragmatic Comparative Effectiveness Research into a Tertiary Pain Management Center Project Summary: Chronic pain is a major healthcare problem with an annual cost of above $600 billion. The quality of data available for treatments of chronic pain is not optimal. Generalizability of explanatory randomized controlled trial data is problematic as these trials exclude up to 90% of patients: leaving out real-world patients with serious medical and psychological comorbidities. Pragmatic trials embedded in patient care compare effectiveness of currently used treatments in real-world application leading to findings that generalize to broader range of patients. The changes in clinical practice and workflow necessary to integrate this type of research within patient care present pragmatic challenges. In this research, my overall objective is to overcome these challenges using an open-source learning health care system – CHOIR – developed by my mentor at the Stanford Pain Management Center. CHOIR is currently used to track patients’ clinical trajectory and treatment response across multiple academic sites resulting in over 25 publications characterizing chronic pain. Through our pilot studies, we have already developed a point-of-care randomization for CHOIR that facilitates integration of research and patient care by allowing the physicians to randomize patients during clinic visits. We have already demonstrated feasibility of the randomization and data collection platform in two ongoing pilot pragmatic clinical trials. We are proposing to better integrate pragmatic research within our clinical practice through conducting a randomized comparative effectiveness trial in 450 patients with chronic pain comparing effectiveness of anti- convulsants and anti-depressants (two most commonly used classes of medications for treatment of chronic pain). We will use the data available in CHOIR as well as the real-world data generated from this clinical trial to build, validate and test a model to predict what clinical characteristics can predict response to either of these classes of medications. The proposed study is the first step to use flexible point-of-care randomization to compare effectiveness of different treatments in different subgroups of patients whenever equipoise exists. Our prediction model will guide decision making process of clinicians choosing between these medications based on clinical characteristics of individual patients. Dr. Salmasi is a physician-scientist with clinical training in Pain Medicine as well as academic training in Clinical Research and Epidemiology. The detailed career development and research plan presented in this application will provide the required resources and mentorship for him to become an independent R01-funded expert in two domains critical to his long-term career goals: (1) advanced clinical trial design and conduct; and (2) advanced statistics and machine learning. Project Narrative Chronic pain is a major healthcare problem with annual cost of above $600 billion in the United States; generalizability of available evidence for treatment of chronic pain (mostly from traditional explanatory randomized controlled trial data) is problematic as these trials exclude up to 90% of patients: leaving out real- world patients with serious medical and psychological comorbidities. We will perform a pragmatic randomized comparative effectiveness trial using our point-of-care randomization. We will then use the data from this trial to build a model predicting the response to anti-convulsants and anti-depressants to develop a platform for precision health: predicting how to choose the best medication for each patient with chronic pain.",Integrating Pragmatic Comparative Effectiveness Research into a Tertiary Pain Management Center,10216024,K23NS120039,"['Academic Training', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Equipoise', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Institution', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Pain', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Precision Health', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain patient', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical pain', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'open source', 'pain catastrophizing', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'point of care', 'pragmatic trial', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'real world application', 'research and development', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536
"Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain Abstract The intervertebral disc (IVD) has an essential role in transferring load during normal spine function and when this normal function fails, symptoms, degeneration and altered spine mechanics may occur. The overall scientific premise of this work is that there is a gap in knowledge of the relationship between contributions from mechanical, inflammatory and biopsychosocial factors that lead to chronic low back pain (LBP). An important gap is a poor understanding of the relationship between IVD degeneration and LBP. This lack of understanding leads to discordance between imaging and self-reported pain and, ultimately, treatments being delivered by an exclusionary process. To address this gap, we will use innovative in vivo imaging tools to quantify the mechanical function of the IVD. We will also measure quantitative sensory factors, biochemical markers, and biopsychosocial factors that, when combined with mechanical function, may better identify subgroups or phenotypes of LBP. The overall goal of this project is to identify if mechanical function of the IVD is a potential risk factor and whether mechanical function can assist with defining phenotypes of LBP. The findings from this study would lead to longitudinal analyses to determine whether these phenotypes predict the transition from acute to chronic LBP. The rationale for this proposed research is that: 1) altered mechanical function of the IVD contributes to LBP. 2) LBP is a heterogeneous condition that can result from a combination of mechanical, inflammatory, and central pain based sources. The central hypothesis is that in vivo measured IVD mechanical function will be an important potential risk factor for both acute and chronic non-specific LBP and that this measure will improve the phenotyping of LBP. In Aim I, we will quantify the association between in-vivo measured IVD mechanical function among acute and chronic non-specific LBP participants and asymptomatic controls. In Aim II, we will derive well-defined phenotypes of LBP using combinations of potential risk factors. Identifying phenotypes of LBP will allow for specific rehabilitation, surgical, pharmaceutical or behavioral treatments to be targeted, resulting in improved patient outcomes. Project Narrative Low back pain is a complex and costly public health problem. We will use innovative combinations of in vivo imaging to quantify mechanical function of the intervertebral disc and combine this information with other known risk factors to develop subgroups of patients with low back pain. This can lead to specific interventions to improve outcomes for patients with low back pain.",Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain,10171398,R01AR075399,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Back Pain', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervertebral disc structure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Low Back Pain', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Neuropeptides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'central pain', 'chronic musculoskeletal pain', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'demographics', 'experience', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'inflammatory pain', 'innovation', 'intervertebral disk degeneration', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'random forest', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIAMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,604326
"A Stress and Pain Self-management m-Health App for Adult Outpatients with Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary/Abstract Our long-term goal is to reduce stress and improve sickle cell disease (SCD) pain control with less opioid use through an intervention with self-management relaxation/distraction exercises (RDE), named You Cope, We Support (YCWS). Americans living with SCD suffer recurrent episodes of acute and chronic pain, both of which are exacerbated by stress. Building on the successes of our prior formative studies, we now propose a well- designed, appropriately powered study to test efficacy of YCWS on outcomes (pain intensity, stress intensity, opioid use) in adults with SCD. We propose to recruit 170 adults for a randomized controlled trial of the short- term (8 weeks) and long-term (6 months) effects of YCWS on outcomes (pain, stress, and opioid use). Stratified on worst pain intensity (<=5; >5), we will randomly assign patients to groups: 85 to Control (Self- monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders), and 85 to Experimental (Self-monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders + use of YCWS [RDE + Support]). We will ask participants to report outcomes daily. During weeks 1-8, we will send system-generated alerts/reminders to both groups via phone call, text, or email to facilitate data entry (both groups) and intervention use support (experimental). If the patient does not enter data after 24 hours, study support staff will contact him/her for data entry trouble-shooting (both groups) and YCWS use (experimental). We will time stamp and track participants' online activities to understand the study context and conduct exit interviews on acceptability of the staff and system-generated support. We will analyze data using mixed-effects regression models (short-term, long-term) to account for repeated measurements over time and utilize machine learning to construct and evaluate models predictive of outcomes. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To determine the short-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in the first 8 weeks, compared to the control group, the experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and secondary outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 2: To determine the long-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in months 3-6, compared to control group, the experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and secondary outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 3 (exploratory): Using machine learning, to develop and evaluate models that predict patient outcomes based on their group assignment and on their personal (e.g., self-efficacy, sex, education, family income, computer experience, etc.,) and environmental characteristics (e.g., distance from care, quality of cell connection, etc.). Findings will guide future studies on the implementation of the m-Health enabled YCWS self-management intervention in the real world by adults with SCD. Findings also will guide the discovery of an ideal delivery method for YCWS, and personal and environmental characteristics of patients who would benefit from YCWS to control effectively the pain of SCD and other types of pain and its psychological impact. Project Narrative Our long-term goal is to reduce stress and improve pain control with less opioid use in patients with sickle cell disease by promoting an intervention with self-management relaxation/distraction exercises, named You Cope, We Support (YCWS). Building on the successes of our prior formative studies to develop the intervention and study protocol, we now propose a well-designed, appropriately powered study to test effects of YCWS on stress, pain, and opioid use in adults with sickle cell disease.

"Automated Physiological Assessment of Chronic Pain in Daily Life The United States is in the midst of dual epidemics of chronic pain and opioid abuse, with approx. 20% of the population in persistent pain, and over 40,000 lives lost each year to opioid misuse. Chronic back pain (CBP) is the most common pain disorder and one of the major reasons for prescribing opioids. Strategies to help reduce CBP pain without opioids are therefore urgent. A promising opioid alternative are psychological interventions that reduce pain intensity, interference and negative emotions, and do not just target the physical pain intensity as many of the traditional pharmacological approaches do. However, these interventions are not often temporally aligned with pain episodes.  We propose to establish diagnostic physiological markers of ongoing clinical pain by capturing ongoing clinical pain and the associated physiological fluctuations and psychological processes. We will develop fully automated real-time detection of ongoing pain in N=80 CBP patients from physiological signs collected in everyday life. We will record multiple physiological signals (electroencephalogram (EEG), facial electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and heart rate (HR)) from two wearable device, one worn around the ears (Earable) and one worn around the wrist (Empatica). The sensing system will be integrated with an experience sampling method (ESM) smartphone app to collect ratings of pain and psychological processes associated with pain episodes. Our goal in Aim 1 is to establish computational physiology-based models that can predict clinical pain in real-life. To achieve this, we will apply machine-learning techniques to physiological data preceding pain self-reports to build predictive models of ongoing pain, with the ultimate goal for these computational models to be able to trigger psychological interventions when needed most, which we aim to develop in our future research. Our goal in Aim 2 is to field-test these computational models in a new group of N=20 CBP patients.  The proposed work will afford, for the first time, autonomous monitoring of clinical pain in real-life. If the real-life pain experience of patients can be captured in physiological patterns preceding pain, then automated tracking of physiology has considerable potential to improve the efficacy of psychological treatments, by providing signals to trigger just-in-time interventions. Overall, the proposed project will contribute fundamental scientific knowledge about psycho-physiological signs of real-life pain and lay the groundwork for translational efforts to improve outcomes of pain self-management and reduce opioid use. The United States is in the midst of dual epidemics of chronic pain and opioid abuse and treatments to reduce pain without opioids are therefore crucial and urgent - psychological treatments have shown potential but also limited efficacy thus far. In this proposal, we will record multiple physiological and psychological signs of pain to develop computational models of real-life fluctuations in chronic pain levels. The findings of this proposal will translate into psychological interventions better matched to psycho-physiological signs of clinical pain and will deepen our understanding of the multidimensional nature of chronic pain.",Automated Physiological Assessment of Chronic Pain in Daily Life,10219003,R21NR018972,"['Adult', 'American', 'Behavioral', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ear', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electromyography', 'Electrooculogram', 'Electrooculography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Face', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Opioid', 'Pain', 'Pain Disorder', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychophysiology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'chronic back pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'clinical pain', 'clinical predictors', 'experience', 'field study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'open source', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'pain patient', 'pain reduction', 'pain self-management', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'psychologic', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'sociodemographics', 'wearable device']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R21,2021,230311
"P-QST Project: Pancreatic Quantitative Sensory Testing (P-QST) to Predict Treatment Response for Pain in Chronic Pancreatitis ABSTRACT: Abdominal pain is the primary driver of morbidity in chronic pancreatitis (CP) and affects approximately 90% of patients over the course of their disease with devastating effects on quality of life. Etiology of pain in CP is multi-factorial. Patients with evidence of pancreatic duct obstruction due to stones and/or strictures are offered invasive treatments such as endotherapy or surgical drainage to relieve pain. However, response to invasive treatments is unpredictable, and currently no clinical tool is available to identify patients who will respond to technically successful treatment. The lack of pain response is at least partially due to supraspinal central sensitization (SCS), a phenomenon of neuropathic and neuroplastic remodeling resulting from persistent pain stimuli. Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), an investigative technique of standardized stimulations to test nociception (the neural signaling that encodes noxious stimuli and the downstream experience of pain), is used in other pain conditions to differentiate between patient subgroups to guide treatment. QST has the potential to change the management algorithm of patients with painful CP. Our preliminary data show that pancreatic QST (P-QST) can phenotype patients with CP into three groups: normal pain processing, segmental (T10 dermatome at the pancreas) sensitization, and widespread hyperalgesia (consistent with SCS). In this proposal, we will evaluate the ability of P-QST to predict response to invasive treatment for painful CP, and to develop a predictive model for individualized prediction of treatment response. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Test the predictive capability of pre-treatment P-QST phenotype for pain improvement following invasive treatment for painful CP. Using pre-procedure P-QST, we will phenotype 150 patients undergoing clinically-indicated invasive treatment for painful CP at UPMC and Johns Hopkins University. Our primary outcome will be average pain score measured by Numeric Rating Scale at 6 months post-intervention. Aim 2. Incorporate P-QST with known and suspected patient, disease, and treatment- related factors to create a model for individualized prediction of response to invasive treatment. Using machine learning tools, we will develop a model that optimizes the prediction of probability of response to invasive treatment in individual patients. This will also determine the relative strength of P-QST as an overall predictor of treatment response. Aim 3. Augment the predictive model (Aim 2) with biochemical inflammatory markers to assess the potential to increase predictive capability for pain improvement following invasive treatment for painful CP. The predictive model developed in aim 2 will be further strengthened by incorporating serum neuroinflammatory markers at baseline. Our findings will be a major step toward development of individualized prediction of treatment response following invasive treatment for painful CP. They will lay the foundation for multicenter studies to fully define the role of P-QST in locally invasive and other treatments for pain management for painful CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis (CP) affects approximately 90% of patients and is the primary driver of morbidity, poor quality of life, and health care utilization. Response to currently available therapies is suboptimal and predicting which individuals will respond to invasive treatment has not been possible to date. The proposed clinical trial will evaluate the predictive capability of Pancreatic Quantitative Sensory Testing (P- QST, a novel assessment of neurosensory phenotyping) for improvement in pain (a health-related outcome) in patients with CP who are undergoing medically-indicated invasive treatment with endoscopic therapy or surgery.",P-QST Project: Pancreatic Quantitative Sensory Testing (P-QST) to Predict Treatment Response for Pain in Chronic Pancreatitis,10297329,R01DK127042,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drainage procedure', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Enrollment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Etiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Nociception', 'Nomograms', 'Numeric Rating Scale', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain management', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pancreatic duct', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persistent pain', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Up-Regulation', 'Urine', 'Visceral', 'Wages', 'central pain', 'central sensitization', 'chemokine', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'demographics', 'dermatome', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurosensory', 'neurotransmission', 'nociceptive response', 'novel', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'pain processing', 'pain reduction', 'pain relief', 'pain score', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized predictions', 'post intervention', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'productivity loss', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,580393
"A Multimodal Approach for Monitoring Prolonged Acute Pain in Neonates Most hospitalized infants experience painful procedures as a part of their care. Repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during early life is associated with permanent changes in brain structure and function and may lead to behavioral and developmental disabilities. Caregivers recognize the need to treat pain in infants but may be reluctant to administer analgesics because of potential short- and long-term side effects. Assessing pain in this vulnerable patient population is difficult as their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage. This difficulty may lead to both over- and under-treatment of pain, placing infants at risk for permanent neurologic injury. We propose to develop models and computer algorithms to automatically and continuously assess pain in neonates based on behavioral and physiological pain indicators.  To achieve this goal, the proposal has two aims: aim 1- Continuously and synchronously record contextual, behavioral and physiological signals from neonates in the NICU while they are undergoing prolonged acute pain; aim 2 - developing a multimodal system for assessing postoperative pain in neonates. The proposed system would generate continuous and standardized pain scores comparable to those obtained by conventional nurse-derived pain scores. It would improve care outcomes by enhancing the assessment of pain while decreasing the burden of pain documentation. It can also eliminate issues of inter-rater reliability associated with conventional neonatal pain assessment. The proposed data collection plan was designed based on our preliminary results and statistical analysis. The proposed system will be evaluated using standard performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, Cohen’s kappa coefficient, or their variations.  The interdisciplinary team includes a neonatologist, Dr. Ho, who is a faculty of both USF College of Medicine and College of Nursing. She practices and oversees the clinical research projects at the Tampa General Hospital NICU (the teaching hospital for USF Health). She ensures the team’s access to the NICU patient population for enrollment. She supervises the performance of the study including nursing pain assessment, video recording, and data collection. The team also includes a professor in nursing who specializes in neonatal opioids dependence and pain, an experienced research nurse, two computer science professors, and one statistics professor. The proposed work aligns very well with the NINR’s mission “to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities.” The proposed neonatal pain assessment approach will provide a tool for nurses to assess pain continuously and more accurately. Pain is one of the critical factors affecting the brain development in neonates, especially in preterm neonates, with chronic illnesses. The incidence of perterm neonates exposed to pain in high and pain assessment and management remain a primary focus of neonatal nursing research. For infants in the NICU coping with pain, the proposed nursing research will enable proper pain treatment that will also improve their long-term outcomes and development. Project Narrative Hospitalized infants may experience hundreds of painful procedures, repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during this early developmental period is associated with permanent alterations in brain structure and function. Assessing pain in this vulnerable population of patients is difficult because their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage.

"Cerebral oscillations of pain Summary Chronic pain disorders are amongst the most burdensome of all diseases in terms of their impact on the individual and the costs to society. The development of novel therapeutic approaches for chronic pain have relied on basic studies involving genetic and molecular approaches in rodent models of pain, but existing drugs generally provide very limited relief for only a small number of patients. The result is that a vast number of people with chronic pain go untreated and have only partial relief. There is substantial and growing evidence from within and outside the pain research fields that indicates neural oscillations reflect cognitive, emotional, and sensory processes, which are all components of the pain experience. Furthermore, we can target these oscillatory patterns to alter perception. In particular, alpha band activity has been associated with chronic pain, and our extensive recent work and preliminary findings indicate that alpha can reliably predict future sensitivity to pain experienced minutes to weeks in the future in healthy subjects. In the proposed studies, we use simultaneous EEG-fMRI to continue our ongoing work on alpha oscillations as pain mechanisms and extend it to test the specificity and sensitivity of the signals and the relationship between alpha, brain networks, and pain. The proposed work would lead to improved understanding of the neurobiology of pain, identify novel brain targets for new or improved interventions, and potentially reveal a prognostic biomarker that would be useful for testing new therapeutic approaches and objectively assessing clinical improvement on an individual basis. Narrative Development of treatments for chronic pain has been limited, but the potential for using brain signal predictive and prognostic biomarkers is growing. In the proposed studies we aim to understand the mechanisms of an electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain oscillation that predicts pain sensitivity in healthy subjects. The findings will provide a major step forward in the development of novel therapies for chronic pain and individualized treatment approaches.",Cerebral oscillations of pain,10207807,R01NS112356,"['Affect', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Pain-Free', 'Painless', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Rodent Model', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'mindfulness intervention', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pain model', 'pain sensitivity', 'predictive marker', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'vector']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,403771
"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART),10086875,R01HL137761,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Attenuated', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infarction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Muscle strain', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Nitrates', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pain Measurement', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pre-hospital setting', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Troponin', 'Unstable angina', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'billing data', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical examination', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'ischemic injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient subsets', 'perfusion imaging', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'reduce symptoms', 'risk stratification', 'secondary outcome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urgent care']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,369024
"Efficient and Cost-Effective Multimodal System for Pain Management in Low Back Pain Project Summary/Abstract Pain is among the most pervasive and universal forms of human distress. Pain typically is measured by patient self-report or clinician impressions, either through clinical interview or the visual analog scale. However, self- reported pain is difficult to interpret and in some circumstances not possible to obtain [Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2002]. To improve the standard of care and advance pain assessment, monitoring, and intervention, we propose (1) a savvy technology based on automatic facial, head, and body movement analysis for a reliable and valid assessment of the occurrence and intensity associated with five causes of acute and chronic low back pain (LBP); (2) inform our understanding of psychosocial and behavioral indicators of chronic LBP to develop new means to prevent chronic LBP. Participants' face, head, and body movement will be recorded during clinical assessment using two synchronized high-definition digital video cameras during extension, flexion, and rotation movements. The obtained video-recordings, taken during a first visit to the clinic and 3 follow-up visits after treatment, will be used for the development of automatic measures of the occurrence and intensity of pain. To investigate the generalizability of the proposed automatic measures, we will explicitly train and test the proposed classifiers on five different types of acute and chronic LBP. To do so, face, head, and body movement will be automatically tracked using our fully- automatic methods. The tracking results will be used to train end-to-end deep-leaning based classifiers to automatically measure the occurrence and intensity of LBP. To investigate the validity of the proposed classifiers, we will compare automated measurement to the patient- and clinician- rated visual analog scale, brief pain inventory, and continuous observer ratings of pain intensity from the video recordings. MANOVA will be used to quantify the relationship between the individual modalities and their combination for the measurement of the occurrence and intensity of the five LBP conditions and for chronic and acute conditions. To inform our understanding of how LBP evolves into a chronic form, we will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to collect behavioral and contextual information beyond the video-recordings and pain scores' assessments. Participants will be monitored for 6 months after treatment, at a frequency of 7 consecutive days per month (1 week per month), and 4 prompts per day, to identify those who evolved to chronic LBP. EMA measures will be used to investigate whether pain intensity differs by psychosocial and behavioral factors both between and within LBP groups as well as whether psychosocial and behavioral factors are associated with the development of chronic LBP. Project Narrative Pain typically is measured by patient self-report, but self-reported pain is difficult to interpret and may be impaired or not possible to obtain. We will use clinically well-characterized data to: (1) develop an automatic multimodal method for the detection of occurrence and intensity of pain in five of the most common and disabling acute and chronic LBP conditions; (2) use EMA to characterize early point psychosocial and behavioral signs that acute pain is likely to become chronic.",Efficient and Cost-Effective Multimodal System for Pain Management in Low Back Pain,10127708,R01NR018451,"['Acute', 'Acute Pain', 'Aftercare', 'American', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Gender', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Low Back Pain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Pain', 'Pain Disorder', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rotation', 'Sacroiliac joint structure', 'Sampling', 'Slipped Disk', 'Spinal Stenosis', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'analog', 'anxious', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'detection method', 'developmental disease', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'impression', 'improved', 'movement analysis', 'multimodality', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'pain score', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'social factors', 'standard of care', 'treatment response']",NINR,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,600759
"Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement Project Abstract Overview: This project aims to develop a reliable 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI method with novel metal artifact correction techniques to provide early identification of prosthetic complications causing persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Relevance: THA is one of the most rapidly growing procedures to treat the end-stage hip joint pain and dysfunction, and its annual cases are estimated to reach 572,000 by 2030. Unfortunately, a substantial number of patients experience PPSP after the procedure, which, without proper treatment, can significantly impair the quality of life. However, the early identification of pain generators for these patients is very difficult because the current diagnostic methods including X-ray, CT, and MRI, have limited sensitivity to pain and suffer from severe artifacts induced by metal in prostheses. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a novel diagnostic approach to accurately identify the abnormal inflammatory changes causing persistent pain to guide the appropriate treatment matched to the exact sources of pain. Approach: We propose the use of 18F-FDG PET/MRI for early identification of sources of PPSP following THA. Our previous 18F-FDG PET/MRI study of chronic pain syndromes demonstrated promising improvements in detecting sites of painful inflammation. However, the severe metal artifacts near metallic prostheses limit the application of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to THA patients. Therefore, our first aim in this project is the development of metal-aware attenuation correction for PET to enable reliable 18F-FDG PET near the metallic prosthesis. Our second aim is the development of high-resolution hip MRI at 3T with metal artifact correction to improve our ability for identifying structural causes of PPSP symptoms. Our third aim is to validate the improvements by 18F- FDG PET/MRI in detection of the pain generators compared to PET/CT and conventional MRI. This will be accomplished by correlating the pain score measurements with 18F-FDG PET/MRI abnormalities at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months following the unilateral THA procedure. Summary: We propose to develop a novel 18F-FDG PET/MRI approach with metal artifact correction methods for early detection of periprosthetic complications causing PPSP following THA. Successful implementation of our method will enable early indication of individualized, effective treatments for THA patients with PPSP. Project Narrative More than a million cases of total joint arthroplasty are performed in the U.S. each year, but 7% to 34% of the patients are estimated to have persistent postsurgical pain after the procedure. Unfortunately, the identification of periprosthetic pain generators using current diagnostic imaging methods is very difficult due to the limited sensitivity and severe artifacts near metallic prostheses. Focusing on total hip arthroplasty cases, we will develop a reliable 18F-FDG PET/MRI method with metal-artifact-correction that allows highly-sensitive metabolic exam and high-resolution morphologic exam for early detection of painful complications following joint arthroplasty.",Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement,10211307,R01AR077706,"['Address', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Arthralgia', 'Awareness', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heating', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip Prosthesis', 'Hip region structure', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Orthopedic Surgery', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Persistent pain', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Water', 'attenuation', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pain score', 'pain sensitivity', 'pain symptom', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'tool', 'uptake', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,420193
"PATHWAYS TO NEW BIOMARKERS IN RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN IN CHILDREN PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs; previously called Recurrent Abdominal Pain) affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. Up to 66% of children go on to have similar symptoms as adults. In children, the two most common FGIDs are functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS - essentially FAP with changes in stooling pattern). Management and treatment are hampered by lack of biomarkers to characterize and understand pathophysiologically what are phenotypically and arbitrarily defined conditions. Previous studies have evaluated IBS, not FAP, and relied primarily on retrospective symptom evaluation and utilized methodology (e.g., 16S sequencing) that limits in depth interrogation of perturbations (e.g., gut dysbiosis) reported in children and adults with IBS. Further, `omics (metabolomics, lipidomics, metaproteomics) data is largely missing from studies of FGIDs and is urgently required - our preliminary data show that it likely provides critical mechanistic insight into the links between abdominal pain symptoms and the pathobiologic alterations of gut dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, and neuroimmune dysfunction which we and others have described in FGIDs. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that these alterations can pathobiologically discriminate FGIDs from healthy controls as well as identify disease mechanisms of pain in FGIDs. We propose to build on our previous work and use previously collected prospective abdominal pain and stooling diaries and stool samples collected from a large and well-vetted group of children with FGIDs (IBS n=133, FAP n=47) and healthy controls (HC, n=112). Our Hypothesis is that microbial community characterization and `omics profiling will provide biomarkers to differentiate FGIDs (IBS and FAP) from HC and generate insight into the genesis of pain symptoms (and stooling characteristics in IBS). Our Specific Aims are to use: 1) Global unbiased whole genome shotgun sequencing, metabolomics, lipidomics and metaproteomics (`omics) on stool samples to differentiate children with FGIDs vs HC using classifier models; Sub-Aim – explore potential differences between FAP and IBS and HC; and 2) Proprietary Texas Children's Hospital Microbiome Center reference databases and state-of-the art bioinformatics approaches (e.g., supervised learning, bipartite, Bayesian models) to identify disorder-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets within children with FGIDs: Sub-Aim 2a - Characterize the relationships between `omics and abdominal pain symptoms (and stooling symptoms in IBS). Sub-Aim 2b – Characterize the relationships between `omics and abnormal physiology (impaired barrier function, neuroimmune dysfunction). It is anticipated that this innovative, multidisciplinary study will better inform patient management and offer unique therapeutic strategies based on novel insights provided by FGID biomarkers. The goals of this application fit with NINR PA- 18-140, the recently published NINR Symptom Science Model, and the NIH Common Fund and Precision Medicine Initiatives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. There is a critical need to understand what factors contribute to pain in these disorders so that effective management and treatment strategies can be designed.

"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective. The results of this project will inform future studies of TMD by pinpointing the most promising variables to measure in longitudinal treatment studies of TMD.",Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments?,10213007,R00DE026810,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Cheek structure', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Michigan', 'Motor Cortex', 'Naproxen', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nociception', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Orofacial Pain', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Persistent pain', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Soft Diet', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'TMD treatment', 'Techniques', 'Temporomandibular Joint Disorders', 'Temporomandibular joint disorder pain', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain morphology', 'central pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'chronic pelvic pain', 'clinical pain', 'clinically relevant', 'dietary restriction', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'pain processing', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tenure track']",NIDCR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,246204
"Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management ABSTRACT Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impair recovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Literature suggests significant disparities exist with regard to pain management and its quality-of-life impacts, particularly among vulnerable populations (e.g. depressed, obese and diabetics). However, there lacks risk stratification tools to identify individuals at high risk for these disparate pain outcomes. Although pain scores are routinely collected in electronic health records (EHRs), shared algorithms to utilize them for care improvement are limited. To advance the efficient and effective use of the abundant amount of electronic data now available, a common data model (CDM) is necessary: standardized structures, terminologies, and rules to represent EHR data. Using a CMD for postoperative pain research would facilitate timely evidence generation across multiple populations and settings, which can provide critical evidence to stakeholders and move the field away from pain treatment for the ‘average’ patient to pain treatment for an individual. In this grant, we propose an innovative approach to advance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain across populations. Our approach will leverage the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to develop tools that use standardize data formats and naming conventions; OMOP has over 140 collaborating sites gloablly. We will further utilize analytical tools developed by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) on this CDM to facilitate disseminate across the research community. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools for adverse pain outcomes across diverse populations. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we will develop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperative pain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deep learning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our models externally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This project will deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify patients at high risk for adverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in the community– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic. NARRATIVE Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical, as poor management can impair recovery, lead to increased morbidity and decreased quality of life; yet, there are significant disparities with regard to pain and its management, particularly in vulnerable populations. The proposed research will develop evidence needed to identify patients at high risk for adverse postoperative pain outcomes. Models will be developed at a tertiary academic health center, validated at the Veterans Health Administration and disseminated to the community via a publicly available website, common data model and open source libraries.",Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management,10165821,R01LM013362,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Adjuvant', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deposition', 'Depressed mood', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'depressed patient', 'diabetic', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'fundamental research', 'health care settings', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'open source', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'pain chronification', 'pain outcome', 'pain score', 'population based', 'prescription opioid', 'random forest', 'risk sharing', 'risk stratification', 'social', 'structured data', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tool development', 'unstructured data', 'web site']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,644033
"Automatic Multimodal Assessment of Pain in Dementia Project Summary/Abstract Chronic and acute pain conditions increase with aging and with age-associated conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and similar dementias, causing suffering, exacerbating diminished quality of life, and likely leading to further morbidity and increased mortality. Understanding and treatment of pain is particularly challenging among populations whose ability to communicate verbally may be impaired, among which patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are of particular importance if only because of the increased aging population. A substantial body of research suggests that methods based on nonverbal indicators of pain yield reliable and valid measurement of pain in patient with dementias. Some of this work has indicated that patients with dementia may in fact be hyper-reactive to pain, rendering the pursuit of improved techniques for assessing pain in the dementia population even more important. Existing techniques for assessing nonverbal indicators of pain have several disadvantages which limit their utility. In particular, they require human observers, are dependent on specialty training, can be laborious, and cannot be applied on a continuous basis. Advances in computer vision and machine learning have the potential to overcome some of these shortcomings. Our “parent proposal” project aims to develop advanced, automated computer-vision and machine-learning models for assessing nonverbal aspects of pain in a longitudinal cohort study of people with low back pain. This supplement proposal seeks to extend our work on the “parent grant”, which aims to “build a fully automatic, multimodal (face, head, and body movement) system to measure the occurrence and intensity of low back pain from video”. In this supplement project, these aims will be extended to older adults with dementia. We will refine the principles discovered for pain assessment in the low back pain population, extend, and evaluate their application in a sample of older adults with dementias in extended-care facilities. Participants, long-term care residents with dementia, were video-recorded during a baseline state as they were lying still on a bed or examination table and then as they underwent a standardized protocol of movements designed to identify painful areas. Participants' face, head, and body movement will be used for the development of automatic measures of the occurrence and intensity of pain. To do so, face, head, and body movement will be automatically tracked using fully- automatic methods. The tracking results will be used to train end-to-end deep- leaning based classifiers to automatically measure the occurrence and intensity of pain in older adults with dementia. To investigate the validity of the proposed classifiers, we will compare automated measurement of pain intensity to reliable and objective pain intensity coding. MANOVA will be used to quantify the relationship between the individual modalities and their combination for the measurement of the occurrence and intensity of pain in older adults with dementia. Project Narrative The present supplement proposal seeks to extend our work on the parent grant to develop automatic multimodal approaches for the measurement of pain intensity in older adults with dementia.

"Characterization of Chronic Pain and its Biopsychosocial Mechanisms in Lupus using Electronic Health Records Up to 100 million Americans live with ongoing pain, costing $635 billion annually. In the United States, there are more than 200,000 people living with SLE, a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease with multi-organ involvement that disproportionately affects females and racial minorities. Living with a chronic disease such as SLE confers multiple challenges. Pain is a frequent self-reported symptom in SLE and is often one of the first symptoms of the disease. Despite treatment advances, pain remains the most prominent, unaddressed patient complaint. The management of pain in SLE has recently become more challenging because of the alarming epidemic of addiction and mortality attributed to opioid misuse. An estimated 31-46% of patients with SLE use prescription opioids. In one study, 70% of individuals using opioids used them for ≥1 year, and 22% were taking ≥2 opioid medications at the same time. Patients with SLE are nearly twice as likely as the general population to have opioid-related overdose hospitalizations. However, efforts to mitigate opioid misuse cannot be achieved without a detailed understanding and sustained investment in clinical research on the underlying mechanisms that produce and maintain chronic pain. Characterizing the burden of chronic pain in SLE is challenging on at least two counts. First, we lack data on the prevalence and burden of chronic pain in SLE, partly due to the absence of reliable approaches to identify patients with clinically significant pain in electronic health records (EHR). Second, there is a critical need to understand the biopsychosocial mechanisms and correlates that drive the pain experience in SLE. In this mentored career development award (K01), Dr. Titilola Falasinnu will use computational methods to increase the understanding of the clinical management chronic pain in SLE using EHR. In Aim 1, Dr. Falasinnu will develop a computational chronic pain phenotyping algorithm using diagnostic codes, pain scores, narrative clinic notes and medications extracted from the EHRs of two large healthcare systems (n~2,400). She will then use the algorithm to estimate chronic pain prevalence in a population-based registry (n~76,000). In Aim 2, Dr. Falasinnu will comprehensively phenotype biopsychosocial correlates of chronic pain using an existing registry of ~500 patients with SLE attending a multi-disciplinary pain center. Throughout the award, Dr. Falasinnu will build on her doctoral training as an epidemiologist and biostatistician to develop new skills in biomedical informatics to conduct impactful pain medicine research. These skills will include working with EHR and registry data, machine learning and natural language processing, pain science, grant-writing, and scientific communication. Through coursework, clinical observation in pain medicine clinics, mentorship, and external conferences and workshops, Dr. Falasinnu will gain the skills needed to apply for her first R01 and pursue a career as a tenure-track principal investigator. Despite treatment advances in rheumatology, pain remains the most prominent, unaddressed patient complaint in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a condition that disproportionately affects women and racial minorities. The proposed research uses electronic health records to characterize chronic pain and its biopsychosocial mechanisms in SLE. The information learned from the study is relevant to public health efforts to understand the burden and natural history of pain; and it is also relevant to NIAM’s mission of improving the understanding of biopsychosocial components of pain in rheumatology.",Characterization of Chronic Pain and its Biopsychosocial Mechanisms in Lupus using Electronic Health Records,10192176,K01AR079039,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Analgesics', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Female', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investments', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Clinics', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population-Based Registry', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'biomedical informatics', 'biopsychosocial', 'body map', 'career', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain management', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data registry', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'pain catastrophizing', 'pain reduction', 'pain score', 'patient stratification', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'post-doctoral training', 'prescription opioid', 'profiles in patients', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial minority', 'skills', 'social', 'sociodemographic variables', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment', 'tenure track', 'text searching', 'unstructured data']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,126252
"Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat pain but have serious side effects, including addiction, dependence, and death from overdose. While there is a significant need for new non-addictive analgesics, efforts to develop new pain medicines have met with limited success. In part, this failure is due to an overreliance on evoked pain measures in preclinical models. Indeed, most preclinical models do not measure spontaneous pain—the main symptom of chronic pain in humans. To increase translational relevance, the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) was developed to quantify characteristic facial expressions associated with spontaneous pain. The MGS is reproducible across labs and was used to evaluate the efficacy of analgesics. However, the MGS has not been widely adopted due to its high resource demands and low throughput. To overcome this limitation, we adapted a machine learning model to classify the presence or absence of pain from mouse facial expressions. We called this model the automated Mouse Grimace Scale (aMGS). After training, this model identified mice in pain with 94% accuracy, comparable to a highly-trained human. However, our original “aMGS 1.0” is limited in several respects. It is only accurate at detecting facial grimacing in white- coated mice, and produces a binary assessment (“pain” vs. “no pain”) instead of a graded score. Moreover, aMGS 1.0 cannot dynamically determine pain status from full-motion videos. Additionally, we relied on an older piece of software that does not consistently extract high-quality images of the mouse face. The aMGS 1.0 also has difficulty distinguishing between images of sleeping and grimacing mice. Finally, aMGS 1.0 suffers from a “black box” problem inherent to most machine learning algorithms, in that we do not know what facial details it uses to produce a pain assessment. Here we propose to overcome all of these limitations by developing a more sophisticated version of our automated pain classifier (aMGS 2.0). To achieve this goal we will: 1) Develop and validate a new open-source platform to classify (frame-by-frame) spontaneous pain intensity from mouse facial expressions, using albino (white) mice and motion information. 2) Enhance the generality of aMGS 2.0 for use with black mice. And, 3) Develop a user-friendly web-based platform that operates on computer-based and mobile devices. We will validate the utility of aMGS with three pain assays that produce grimaces in rodents—inflammatory pain, post-surgical (laparotomy) pain, and neuropathic pain. To increase rigor and reproducibility, two pain assays will be performed and scored with aMGS 2.0 in an independent lab. Numerous investigators in the pain field have expressed interest in using our proposed model. The platform will include a cloud-based data repository and analytic tools to facilitate curation of public data, continuous improvement of the model over time, and integration of new analytic tools. One analytic tool that we plan to develop will identify mouse features that most influence pain classification. NARRATIVE As the opioid epidemic has made clear, there is significant need to develop new ways to study chronic pain and relief of pain in preclinical models. Development of an accurate and broadly useful machine learning model and web-based platform will make it possible for researchers to objectively quantify and study spontaneous pain in mice, and hence provide a way to more rapidly identify and validate new analgesic drugs.",Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions,10094266,R01NS114259,"['Acetic Acids', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Analgesics', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Regions', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Pain', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Laparotomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Reflex action', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'blind', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain relief', 'cloud based', 'convolutional neural network', 'data repository', 'deep neural network', 'efficacy evaluation', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'inflammatory pain', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'pain relief', 'painful neuropathy', 'persistent symptom', 'pre-clinical', 'recurrent neural network', 'side effect', 'smartphone Application', 'spontaneous pain', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web services']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,362249
"Multivariate Machine Learning to Characterize Opioid-induced Alterations in the Brain in Chronic Pain PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prescription opioids are a potent class of drugs for treating pain. However, growing body of research has described iatrogenic consequences of long-term (> 90 days) opioid use in patients with chronic pain including hyperalgesia and impaired executive function. Dopamine is a critical modulator of executive function. While changes in pain and behavior have been noted, little is known about the brain’s morphology, neural and dopaminergic activity that change over time with long-term prescription opioid use. Consistent with the NIDA Strategic Plan objective 1.3, this K25 proposal seeks to “establish the effects of drug use, addiction, and recovery on brain circuits, behavior, and health” using neuroimaging-informed tools. Specifically, the present study combines multiple levels of investigation, including structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and neuropsychological assessments of executive function, and employ machine learning techniques for analysis to identify the effects of long-term prescription opioid use on the brain in chronic pain patients. The applicant will use her advanced quantitative skills in neuroimaging data analysis and modeling to training in QST, and experience in cognitive neuropsychology, epidemiology of chronic pain and addiction to develop an independent research plan in translational pain and successfully compete for future R01 funding. To achieve the training needed to facilitate this investigation, the applicant has consulted with an expert in chronic pain research and opioid therapy, a substance abuse specialist, a neuropsychologist, an epidemiologist, an imaging scientist, and a machine learning leader in neuroimaging field to develop an innovative study and training plan. 40 patients with a diagnostically homogeneous chronic pain condition (i.e., chronic low back pain; CLBP) on long-term opioid therapy, as compared to 40 opioid-naïve CLBP patients, will be studied to achieve the following Aims: 1) Measure pain, cognitive performance, neural and dopaminergic activity during concurrent pain and executive function task fMRI-PET to characterize the effects of opioids on pain processing and executive function in CLBP; 2) measure intrinsic brain activity during resting state fMRI-PET to identify intrinsic brain alterations associated with long-term opioid use in CLBP; and 3) apply high-resolution structural MRI to measure opioid-induced morphological changes in CLBP. This research is innovative in its use of combined QST and neuro- psychological measures with multimodal imaging and sophisticated statistical approaches. It is significant because of its comprehensive approach towards addressing the NIDA Strategic Plan objective. Findings stand to inform medical decision-making regarding pain care and opioid prescription, as well as risk mitigation strategies. The research, training and results obtained will provide a platform for applicant’s long-term scientific research goal of becoming an independent R01-funded, faculty-level principal investigator performing translational pain research aimed at developing neuroimaging tools to have clinical application. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE Inquiry into the effects of long-term prescription opioid use in patients with chronic pain are highly relevant and timely due to the increased epidemic of prescription opioid use in the US. Using quantitative sensory testing, neuropsychological assessments, multimodal neuroimaging and advanced statistical techniques for data analysis, the proposed study seeks to identify the effects of long-term prescription opioid use on the brain and their relation to clinical symptoms. By detecting changes at behavioral, molecular and neural systems levels, this study will be pivotal in the development of effective pain management strategies in chronic pain, and training of Dr. Jarrahi as an independent investigator in the field of translational pain research.",Multivariate Machine Learning to Characterize Opioid-induced Alterations in the Brain in Chronic Pain,10203904,K25DA048179,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Consult', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine D1 Receptor', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intercept', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysics', 'Questionnaires', 'Raclopride', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'brain morphology', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain patient', 'chronic painful condition', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'dopamine system', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'imaging scientist', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'opioid tapering', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'pain behavior', 'pain patient', 'pain processing', 'patient oriented', 'prescription opioid', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'tool']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,175889
"Development of selective calpain-1 inhibitors for chronic pain PROJECT SUMMARY Never in the history of the United States has the unmet medical need to develop novel, non-opioid therapeutics for chronic pain been more urgent than it is today. More than 65 million US adults suffer from chronic pain, resulting in almost $635 billion in annual healthcare costs. Despite their limited efficacy, and potential for addiction, tolerance, and impaired motor performance, opioids have become a mainstay for chronic pain management, resulting in an opioid epidemic that is ravaging communities throughout the US. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel, non-opioid therapies for chronic pain management. This application addresses this unmet medical need by leveraging our novel artificial intelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery platform to develop selective inhibitors of calpain-1 as novel non-opioid therapeutics for chronic pain. Studies in chronic neuropathic pain animal models have shown that nerve injury overactivates calpain-1, which downregulates K+ Cl- cotransporter activity, resulting in diminished synaptic inhibition and neuropathic pain. Prior work by our group has also shown that both pharmacological inhibition and whole body genetic knockout of calpain-1 attenuates chronic pain behaviors in mouse models of sickle cell disease (SCD). Importantly, the analgesic effect of calpain-1 inhibition did not induce tolerance side effects, suggesting the potential for calpain-1 inhibitors to be non-addictive. By applying our innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery platform to screen a virtual chemical library, we identified four (4) novel calpain-1 inhibitors, and validated them for efficacy in biochemical assays. Here, we propose to progress our most potent hit compound to a lead compound that is calpain-1 selective, cysteine protease family selective, non-opioid, and CNS penetrant with efficacy demonstrated in at least 1 of 3 chronic pain animal models tested, including chronic sickle cell disease pain, chronic inflammatory pain, and chronic neuropathic pain. Three aims are proposed, including Aim 1: Synthesize ~100 analogs of our most potent hit compound, and characterize in vitro activity and selectivity. Success criteria: Top 20 cell-permeable, calpain-1 inhibitors, moderately selective against calpain-2, and highly selective against cathepsins and caspase-1, Aim 2: Evaluate ADME-Tox and PK profile of our top 20 calpain-1 inhibitors from Aim 1. Success criteria: Top 2 CNS-penetrant selective calpain-1 inhibitors with favorable in vivo PK profile, and Aim 3: Determine the efficacy and PK/PD relationship of our top calpain-1 inhibitor in 3 chronic pain animal models. Success: at least 40% reduction in mechanical hyperalgesia in at least 1 of the 3 chronic pain animal models tested. Successful completion of this Phase I will yield a novel CNS-penetrant, selective calpain-1inhibitor with efficacy demonstrated in at least 1 chronic pain animal model. Our overall product would be the first, oral, CNS acting, selective calpain-1 inhibitor for chronic pain. Importantly, our product would reduce opioid usage in chronic pain patients, and help to stem the US opioid epidemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Never in the history of the United States has the unmet medical need to develop novel, non-opioid therapeutics for chronic pain been more urgent than it is today.

"Identifying Optimal Pain Management for Elders ABSTRACT Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impair recovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Additional specific risks in elder surgical patients include delirium and falls. Currently prejudice rather than evidence guides the complex problem of elder perioperative pain management. Given the gravity of the US opioid epidemic, policy makers are quickly establishing rules and regulations for opioid prescribing. These policies are blanket regulations that neglect emerging evidence regarding the need for differential opioid prescriptions based on clinical and patient factors, particularly in elders. Currently, there lacks tools to identify elders at high risk for adverse pain outcomes. Such tools are needed to provide critical evidence on pain management to stakeholders and move the field away from pain treatment for the ‘average’ elder patient to pain treatment for an individual. In this grant, we propose an innovative approach to advance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain in elders. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools for adverse pain outcomes in elders. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we will develop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperative pain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deep learning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our models externally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This project will deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify elder patients at high risk for adverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in the community– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic. NARRATIVE Surgery is common in elders and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical, as poor management can impair recovery, lead to increased morbidity and decreased quality of life. The proposed research will develop evidence needed to identify elder patients at high risk for adverse postoperative pain outcomes. Models will be developed at a tertiary academic health center, validated at the Veterans Health Administration and disseminated to the community via a publicly available website and open source libraries.",Identifying Optimal Pain Management for Elders,10212182,R01HS027434,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,393732
