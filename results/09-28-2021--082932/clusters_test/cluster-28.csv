"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,10194459,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2021,39939
"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,10135698,R01HD071686,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Computers', 'Control Animal', 'Couples Therapy', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain computer interface', 'design', 'forging', 'functional restoration', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor learning', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'network architecture', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'neuromechanism', 'post stroke', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke model', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,415784
"Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0) OVERALL: ABSTRACT  The scope of regenerative medicine encompasses the repair, regeneration, and replacement of defective, injured, and diseased tissues and organs. The success of regenerative therapies is dependent, at least in part, on a favorable microenvironment in which the regenerative processes occur. Technological innovations and a deepened mechanistic understanding of how these microenvironmental signals influence tissue regeneration has drawn attention to the critical importance of the clinical field with foundations in the application of physical, thermal, and electrical stimuli to promote functional restoration—rehabilitation. We propose that the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitative science are inextricably intertwined, an intersection of disciplines that we and others have termed Regenerative Rehabilitation. To realize the full potential of Regenerative Rehabilitation, there is a need for formalized mechanisms that promote the interaction of basic scientists with rehabilitation specialists. During the initial funding cycle, the Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) built a national network of investigators and programs that has helped to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies across the domains of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation. This proposal seeks funding for AR3T 2.0, in which we will build on successes achieved and lessons learned over the initial period of support with the goal of being even more responsive to the needs of the greater community. Six specific aims define a framework upon which we will achieve our goals. AR3T will provide education and drive the science underlying Regenerative Rehabilitation by: 1) Providing didactic programs that expose rehabilitation researchers to cutting-edge investigations and state-of-the-art technologies in the field of regenerative medicine (Didactic Aim); 2) Cultivating collaborative opportunities between renowned investigators in the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation (Collaborations Aim); 3) Coordinating a pilot funding program to support novel lines of Regenerative Rehabilitation research (Pilot Funding Aim); 4) Developing and validating technologies to advance the measurement and use of the regenerative rehabilitation programs (Technology Aim); 5) Promoting our center’s expertise to a broad community of trainees, investigators, and clinicians (Promotion Aim); 6) Carefully monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our program will ensure that we are successful in achieving our goals (Quality Control Aim). Administrative note: In the preparation of this proposal, we made every effort to present a comprehensive and detailed plan for achieving our goals while minimizing redundancy. Therefore, in multiple places, we refer the reader to specific components of the application, rather than repeating text. We appreciate the time and effort the reviewers devote to the evaluation of the proposals.  Sincerely, Fabrisia, Tom and Mike PROJECT NARRATIVE  Regenerative Rehabilitation is the integration of principles and approaches across the fields of rehabilitation science and regenerative medicine. The integration of these two fields will increase the efficiency of interventions designed to optimize physical functioning to the benefit of a wide range of individuals with disabilities. The Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) 2.0 will build on the momentum gained over the first cycle of funding with the goal of continuing to illuminate and seize opportunities to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies in the domain of Regenerative Rehabilitation.",Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0),10210417,P2CHD086843,"['Accountability', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Physical Function', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reader', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'career', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'falls', 'functional restoration', 'gait examination', 'healing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'investigator training', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'regenerative', 'regenerative rehabilitation', 'regenerative therapy', 'rehabilitation research', 'rehabilitation science', 'repaired', 'response', 'sabbatical', 'social media', 'success', 'symposium', 'technological innovation', 'therapy design', 'tissue regeneration', 'webinar']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P2C,2021,983634
"Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement ABSTRACT Post-treatment substance use disorder (SUD) relapse rates are high (40-60% at one year), with relapse occurring early (median time to relapse 1-3 months), indicating that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Telehealth and VR technologies have the ability to greatly increase the accessibility of highly engaging recovery support. Combining these two approaches provides a unique opportunity to create a highly engaging, cost-effective take home recovery support solution targeting the critical transition from inpatient care. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its existing highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app, to develop a convenient and cost-effective integrated take-home combined VR and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) that begins in the inpatient clinic. RecoVRi is designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from inpatient to home, thereby reducing the risk of relapse and associated health and monetary costs. Sober Grid is collaborating with TRIPP, Inc. to utilize TRIPP’s immersive wellness platform. The design of the TRIPP experience leverages a large body of existing research on the use of VR technology in the mental wellness arena and utilizes proven mindfulness structures, targeted sound frequencies, visuals and interactions that have a multiplicative effect when administered through immersion. The Sober Grid Network will create a support wrapper to the VR experience that facilitates access to crisis management experts and community for the person in early recovery. The unique combination of a personalized and targeted self-regulation toolkit and community and professional support is a key differentiator for this service. In phase I of the project, we will develop and pilot test a proof-of-concept RecoVRi VR-mindfulness protocol and intervention to ascertain feasibility and acceptability (Aim 1). In phase II of the project, a production-quality intervention will be developed with new VR content created by the TRIPP development team specifically targeting themes supporting recovery from alcohol, stimulant and opioid SUD separately (Aim 2). We will then test post-treatment recovery support engagement in the RecoVRi intervention in comparison to treatment as usual in a randomized comparison trial involving 80 patients receiving inpatient treatment and transitioning to the home setting (Aim 3). Over the span of both phases, we will seek regulatory guidance from the FDA in order to attain clearance for use of the RecoVRi intervention as a therapeutic medical device (Aim 4). NARRATIVE Substance use treatment research findings indicate that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app to develop and test a convenient and cost-effective, integrated, take-home combined, virtual reality and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from the inpatient clinic to home.",Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement,10209530,R44DA050222,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Android', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Immersion', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Medical Device', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Well in self', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'sobriety', 'social', 'sound frequency', 'substance use treatment', 'success', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment program', 'treatment research', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2021,840913
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) Summary: Overall section Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). In a recently published report, Simmons-Mackie (1) estimates that over two million people in North America are currently living with aphasia. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, the incidence of stroke in younger individuals has been steadily increasing (2). In fact, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina are under the age of 60 (2). Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others’ speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified as the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems and never fully recover. To address the need for studies improving long-term outcomes in aphasia, the Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR), funded for just under four years at the time of this application, has made great progress towards understanding the mechanisms that promote spontaneous and therapy-induced recovery in aphasia. The overarching goal of the research proposed in this renewal application is to maintain our focus on aphasia therapy. Specifically, during the next funding phase, the focus of C-STAR is to improve access to aphasia therapy, enhance the effect of behavioral aphasia therapy to promote an improved aphasia therapy outcome, and understand overall health and neurolinguistic factors that influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will continue to rely on collaboration among five main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Leonardo Bonilha, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will continue to focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects have proven successful in yielding a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia therapy. Relying on this dataset, Bonilha and Rorden’s project will focus on the relationship between brain health and recovery from aphasia, whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to aphasia therapy success as well as new neurolinguistic models of speech and language processing. Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by expanding access to therapy by using telerehabilitation and by understanding the effects of drug therapy, brain health, and neurolinguistic factors on the outcome of aphasia therapy.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),10094377,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anodes', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Double-blind trial', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Enrollment', 'Escitalopram', 'Family', 'Financial Support', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phase I/II Clinical Trial', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severities', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'chronic stroke', 'disability', 'double-blind placebo controlled trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'language processing', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'success', 'syntax', 'telerehabilitation', 'therapy outcome']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2021,2558826
"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Project Summary/Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project proposes the deployment of an AI-powered image-processing tool, named PostureCheck™, to automatically detect when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-extremity (UE) rehabilitation exercises. The system is based on a standard video camera and the artificial intelligence (AI) software developed under the NIH Phase-I project. PostureCheck™ will be fully integrated with Barrett Technology's existing Burt® UE rehabilitation robot, ensuring that patients are provided appropriate and timely feedback to encourage the correct performance of therapeutic exercises without requiring constant therapist supervision.  Burt® is an FDA-listed UE rehabilitation robot that supports the weight of a patient's arm and hand while the patient moves his/her arm to interact with on-screen games. Burt® offers guided assistance, visual and haptic feedback, and activities and assessments to both help train the patient and measure progress. Clinical studies have shown that Burt® can be used to improve patients' performance in one-on-one sessions with a therapist. However, the system lacks the capability for a single therapist to monitor and work with several patients and Burt® systems at one time.  The proposed SBIR Phase-II activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, the annotated dataset generated in Phase-I will be used to develop three separate AI modules. These modules will be integrated into a framework that allows therapists to monitor the outcome of the modules, and, through feedback, enable the system to auto- adapt to improve performance continuously. In Aim 2, stakeholder feedback will be gathered and integrated to design multiple user interfaces for the PostureCheck™ tool. Specific interfaces will be created for use by therapists during and after RT sessions. PostureCheck™ will be integrated with the Burt® device to empower therapists to provide effective feedback to patients and deter the use of compensatory movements. Finally, in Aim 3, forty-two stroke survivors will be recruited in an interventional study deploying the PostureCheck™ and Burt® systems. Subjects will undergo eighteen RT sessions in either an individual or group therapy format. Motor performance between groups will be compared to gather information about the suitability of the combined systems for multi-patient RT therapy in future rehabilitation centers.  The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a practical Burt®-plus-PostureCheck™ system to empower therapists to supervise multiple patients simultaneously through a gamut of useful functionalities. The system will be suitable for deployment in clinics as well as rehabilitation centers such as wellness gyms. Project Narrative  Each year, more than 650,000 Americans survive a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body in most cases. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and ultimately improved function. This proposal aims to expand PostureCheck™, to provide timely and targeted feedback and enable therapists to perform robot-assisted and multi-patient therapy in a minimally supervised session.",PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device,10156853,R44EB027525,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Therapy', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation device', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'chronic stroke', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'haptic feedback', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'interest', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'robot assistance', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'software development', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIBIB,"BARRETT TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R44,2021,813419
"Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is, functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies, we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two complementary cohorts of patients—acute and chronic—longitudinally using the same multimodal functional and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent, as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia. Project Narrative Aphasia (acquired language impairment) is one of the most common consequences of stroke and often leads to significant long-term disability. This project seeks to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia.",Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke,10177996,R01DC013270,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Phase', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cohort', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,548529
"Functional anomaly mapping of aphasia recovery Project Summary Difficulty communicating (aphasia) is one of the most common and debilitating results of left-hemisphere stroke. Although aphasia symptoms are highly variable and recovery is difficult to predict, much research has shown that lesion size and location are major drivers of aphasia symptoms and recovery. However, this previous research has only considered direct anatomical damage caused by the lesion. This is a critical limitation because stroke lesions also cause indirect effects on the function of brain structures distant from the lesion. Throughout this application, I refer to this as “remote dysfunction.” Although initially thought to resolve quickly after the stroke, remote dysfunction is now known to persist throughout recovery and independently contribute to outcomes. Studies of aphasia recovery have focused almost exclusively on the idea of recovery through reorganization, whereby behavioral improvement occurs through plastic reorganization of brain networks. These studies have eschewed the older idea that recovery occurs through partial resolution of remote dysfunction (RRD) caused by lesions. Consequently, it is not clear how RRD contributes to aphasia recovery. The applicant has developed a new machine learning approach called functional anomaly mapping (FAM) that uses resting BOLD functional MRI signal to map remote dysfunction throughout the brain in individual stroke survivors. FAM maps have much better test-retest reliability than current measures, like task- related fMRI activity and resting state functional connectivity, as well as several other features that make it promising as a clinically useful tool. The applicant has already demonstrated that remote dysfunction measured with FAM relates to behavioral outcomes in people with chronic aphasia. During the mentored phase of this award, the applicant will optimize the FAM approach and test competing hypotheses about the biological mechanisms generating the remote dysfunction measured in chronic aphasia. During the independent phase, the applicant proposes a longitudinal study to understand the contribution of RRD to aphasia recovery. The applicant proposes a comprehensive training plan to expand his knowledge in the following areas: the biological mechanisms of stroke recovery and neuroplasticity beyond aphasia, machine learning, biomarker development, and advanced neuroimaging analysis. The research and training during this award will enable the applicant to develop a long-term, independent research program focused on understanding the neural correlates of aphasia and developing translational brain measures to inform clinical decision-making in aphasia neurorehabilitation. Public Health Relevance Statement Difficulty communicating (aphasia) is one of the most common and debilitating results of left-hemisphere stroke. While aphasia symptoms are highly variable and recovery is difficult to predict, stroke size and location are significant determinants of outcomes. Research that leads to a more complete characterization of how stroke lesions affect residual brain function over the course of recovery will lead to a better understanding of the brain-behavior relationship in aphasia and has the potential to inform clinical decision-making in aphasia neurorehabilitation.",Functional anomaly mapping of aphasia recovery,10214766,K99DC018828,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deafferentation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral outcome', 'biomarker development', 'brain behavior', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'neuromechanism', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,121473
"A new mechanistic and technological framework for uncovering the spinal cord neural systems important for functional recovery after injury Project Summary and Abstract Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is known about the neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. Sensory based rehabilitation suggests a strong link between cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory neuron activity and motor recovery. Previous experiments provide strong support for the intermediate zone (IZ) of the spinal cord (SC) as an important site mediating this recovery. However, few studies have assessed the role of specific IZ neurons in functional recovery. Key barriers to progress include lack of characterization of specific cell types within the IZ and a paucity of tools to visualize circuits and test their functions in motor performance and recovery following SCI. Our lab combines sophisticated mouse genetic approaches with sensitive motor movement tracking to understand how sensory information is encoded by the SC to influence behavior. Using this approach, we uncovered that intermediate zone (IZ) parvalbumin positive interneurons (PVs) are important for tactile motor responses and locomotion. We hypothesize that IZ-PVs process sensory information to activate specific muscle groups during locomotion and that they play a critical role in activity-based functional recovery following SCI. The ability to identify circuits important for functional recovery relies on how accurately we can quantify differences in behavioral outcomes. We are implementing an unsupervised approach using 3-D pose dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize both sensitive behavioral biomarkers and uncover key spinal cord circuits important for the recovery process. Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration are improving, and this project both identifies the neural systems and synaptic mechanisms that would be most effective to target such interventions and establishes an AI-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased quantification of motor recovery in rodents. Thus, this project makes original and important contributions to the field of spinal cord research in ways that are specifically aligned with central missions of the NINDS. Moreover, our experimental scrutiny at both the neural and behavioral levels establishes a critical foundation for developing a leading research program and securing independent award funding studying the spinal cord circuits important for sensorimotor function and recovery following SCI. To this end, I have developed a thorough and pragmatic career development plan supported by a strong committee of mentors with extensive track records of laboratory and departmental level mentoring and distinguished portfolios of SCI-specific grant support from the NIH, DoD and private foundations. My career development activities will be focused on four aspects of my academic success. 1) Mentorship and guidance focused on laboratory management. 2) Development and growth of my independent research program and award funding, with a focus on SCI research gap-based training. 3) Navigating institutional responsibilities and fulfilling requirements for promotion and tenure. 4) Expanding my scientific network and profile.

"Robotically Augmented Mental Practice for Neuromotor Facilitation SUMMARY Upper limb motor function is often impaired due to neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. The ultimate objective is to innovate effective motor rehabilitation for enhancing clinical outcomes in stroke populations by discovering and applying scientific mechanisms and developing new engineering technologies to facilitate neuromotor adaptation. In stroke rehabilitation, mental practice, such as motor imagery and action observation, is a very effective intervention when performed appropriately. The challenge is that performance quality and efficacy of mental practice are highly variable and can be compromised. It is hypothesized that control and observation of robotic grasp and release actions via synergistic proximal muscle activation will increase neuromotor excitability of the non-activated distal muscles and hand function due to cognitive engagement with the externally present and visible robotic prosthesis. The Specific Aim of this proof of concept and feasibility study is to develop and test robotically augmented mental practice with synergistic proximal muscles for neuromotor facilitation of hand muscles. A robotically augmented mental practice will be developed for individuals to grasp and release an object by controlling the associated actions of a sound- generating robotic prosthesis utilizing surface electromyography (EMG) of shoulder/trunk muscles with deep learning algorithms. To demonstrate the proof of concept of increased neuromotor excitability and hand performance in able-bodied adults, transcranial magnetic stimulation will be applied to the motor cortex for the non-activated hand muscles and reaction time and maximal voluntary contraction performances will be tested with a finger in various practice conditions. The feasibility and possible trends in stroke survivors with upper extremity disabilities will also be examined. The project will be performed at the Georgia Institute of Technology by an interdisciplinary team of experts in fields directly related to the study: an applied physiologist, mechanical and biomedical engineers, a physical therapist, and a clinical neuroscientist. The successful completion of the study will provide augmented mental practice for neuromotor facilitation for distal muscles, and evidence for efficacy will be provided in able-bodied adults and feasibility in post-stroke individuals. The results will lead to the development of a more effective priming intervention before physical practice that can facilitate functional improvement as part of stroke rehabilitation. This project will develop and test a new paradigm of motor imagery for facilitating neuromotor excitability and performance of distal muscles in the upper limb by adopting robotic prosthesis and integrating proven procedures for neuromotor facilitation. In this paradigm, individuals will interact with a robotic prosthesis by controlling the activation of the shoulder/trunk muscles that are functionally associated with the distal hand muscles. The development of this paradigm and its integration with able-bodied and post-stroke disabled individuals will open new scientific and clinical concepts and studies on augmented motor imagery, which can lead to the development of effective rehabilitation strategies for individuals with neuromotor impairment, such as hemiparetic stroke survivors.",Robotically Augmented Mental Practice for Neuromotor Facilitation,10301588,R21NS118435,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Auditory', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disabled Persons', 'Distal', 'Electromyography', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Extensor', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Fingers', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Institute', 'Robotics', 'Shoulder', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Upper Extremity', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'grasp', 'hand dysfunction', 'hemiparetic stroke', 'improved', 'innovation', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mental practice', 'motor recovery', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'physical therapist', 'post stroke', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'robot control', 'sound', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'trend', 'virtual', 'visual motor']",NINDS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2021,407538
