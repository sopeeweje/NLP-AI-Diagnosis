"Smartphone Pupillometer for At-Home Screening for Risk of Alzheimer’s Disease Project Summary/Abstract Dementia represents one of the most important public health concerns in the coming decades. Among the most important research goals will be to identify the earliest, most reliable and easily obtainable biomarkers of degeneration, because early identification of individuals most likely to decline now represents the most promising window for therapeutic interventions. The main objective of this project is to develop an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) screening solution based completely on a smartphone application that converts the phone’s facial recognition IR camera into a mobile pupillometer. Our scientific premise, demonstrated by our recent clinical findings, is that pupillary responses provide a biomarker of cognitive effort required to perform tasks before overt performance declines are manifest. Pupil size during cognitive tasks (e.g., digit span recall) increases in response to increased demands, is inversely related to cognitive ability (individuals with lower ability show greater dilation/compensatory effort), and pupil size decreases and performance declines when task demands exceed abilities and compensatory capacity. Someone requiring more effort to achieve the same score as another person is likely to be closer to maximum compensatory capacity and, therefore, at higher risk for decline. We have found that individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are at greater risk for AD, show greater dilation (effort) on the digit span task, and that greater dilation is associated with greater polygenic risk for AD and neuroimaging indicators of locus coeruleus (LC) dysfunction. This is important because pupillary responses reflect LC functioning, and postmortem studies implicate the LC as an early site of AD pathogenesis and degenerative changes with disease progression. Thus, pupillary responses may serve as a specific biomarker of functional alterations in a brain system affected by the earliest manifestations of AD. Currently, pupillary responses can be measured in as little as 5 minutes using minimally invasive, but expensive and complicated office-based devices. To increase the scalability of pupillometry screening in AD, we propose to develop a smartphone assessment that older adults can administer themselves at home that tracks small changes in pupil dilation during cognitive tasks. We will further develop and evaluate different machine learning algorithms that use the pupillary response biomarker measured by the phone to perform automated risk assessment of severity of mild cognitive impairment at the early stages of AD. Because the project would be carried out in the context of a larger NIA-funded RF1 affiliated with the UC San Diego Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), it will be possible to validate mobile pupillometry assessments against gold-standard in-lab pupillometry in older adults with MCI, early AD, and healthy controls. Our translational goal is to provide access to low-cost at-home screening for people who are potentially at early stages of dementia. In addition, the creation of a low-cost and accurate pupillometer that can be immediately deployed through smartphones will open-up new opportunities for large scale cognition studies that require measurement of pupillary response frequently in daily life settings. Project Narrative Recent research has shown that pupillary responses, an index of how much cognitive effort is needed to perform a memory task, may provide a new biomarker of early risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD); people who have to try harder to perform the task may be closer to cognitive decline. This project aims to develop a self- administrable pupillometer for older adults that uses a smartphone’s built-in IR camera to record pupillary responses during a digit span memory task, with the goal of enabling a machine learning-based automated assessment of risk for cognitive decline. An automated phone-sensor based early stage AD screening tool has the power to enable broad screening of the population of older adults at low cost at-home, in low-resource clinics, and through community health services.",Smartphone Pupillometer for At-Home Screening for Risk of Alzheimer’s Disease,10214386,R21AG072534,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Community Health Services', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mydriasis', 'Older Population', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'minimally invasive', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'specific biomarkers']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2021,392099
"Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate is an epileptologist and neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, whose long-term career goal is to become an independent- ly funded translational investigator with expertise at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive co-morbidities. The ability to translate the clinical experience, research tools, and intellectual framework from the field of epilepsy to that of the neurodegenerative diseases, and vice versa, could be a powerful approach to studying both processes. During the proposed training period, the candidate will combine her prior training in epilepsy, EEG signal processing, and machine learning, with newly acquired skills in neuroimaging (functional MRI), biostatistics, and additional clinical exposure to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Cash, an expert in epilepsy and neurophysiologic signal processing, and the co-mentorship of Dr. Reisa Sperling, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuroimaging approaches, the candidate proposes to: 1) Delineate the spectrum of epileptiform activity in early stages of AD and develop computa- tional tools to identify this activity; 2) Establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie epileptiform activity in AD; and 3) Determine how epileptiform abnormalities are associated with cognitive trajectories in patients with early stage AD. Visual and computational analysis of 24- hour scalp EEGs will be integrated with resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements, amy- loid PET imaging, and longitudinal cognitive testing from subjects with AD, to develop a com- prehensive understanding of the role of epileptiform abnormalities in early stages of AD. In addi- tion to the research proposed, the candidate’s career development plan entails rigorous coursework and seminars, practical hands-on experience, and close guidance from a board of academic advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow the candidate to establish a clinical and research niche at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases, and to develop a comprehensive toolbox with which to probe human brain function from the standpoint of neurophysiology, structure, connectivity, and tar- geted pathology. Collectively, these will form the foundation for a successful career as an inde- pendent investigator pursuing important clinical and translational research projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, or both. Project Narrative People with Alzheimer’s disease are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and people with epilepsy commonly suffer from impairments in memory and cognition. Our goals are to better understand the interplay between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and to determine whether epileptiform activity may be a treatable contributor to cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. This has important public health implications, as according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a treatment that slows the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s disease by five-fold would reduce the number of people with severe Alzheimer’s disease from 6.5 million to 1.2 million and reduce Medicare costs by 50% by the year 2050.",Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease,10130638,K23NS101037,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Technical Expertise', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,200880
"Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer's Disease Genes and Risk Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer’s Disease Genes and Risk The molecular basis and genetic architecture of dementia remain a puzzle. As no drug yet prevents, delays, or reverses it, aging populations potentially face a tidal threat of incipient and socially disruptive Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) cases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked over 100 loci with AD and explain much of population attributable risk, but only a fraction of heritability. This heritability gap means it remains difficult to design and assess which surveillance, screening, preventive, and stratification programs are effective. In turn, this hinders therapeutic trials. The challenge in translating genetic variants into patient classifications is twofold. First, AD is polygenic, so relevant disease driving mutations are spread thin across a multitude of different genes and patients. Second, current interpretations of the deleterious effects of mutations lack accuracy, so the impactful few cannot be distinguished from the benign multitude in any given subject. These problems compound and fog the statistical genetics of AD risk and morbidity with poor signal to noise ratio. The crux of our solution is to add a massive amount of new information, exploit it efficiently through computation, then perform rigorous multi-pronged experimental validation. We start from the hypothesis that AD arises through mutational perturbations that affect functional pathways beyond the built-in evolutionary tolerances. New algorithms compute these excessive mutational forces and place them in integrative machine learning frameworks to sort between AD patients and controls, and which can also reflect functional interactions among proteins or genes. Innovations include a mathematical model of evolution based on calculus; ensemble machine learning over human genome variations; and harmonic analysis of mutational perturbations in functional networks. The outcome will, for the first time, integrate genomic variations relevant to AD in the context of all relevant evolutionary history and all known functional interactions. In practice, this will increase power and resolution, enable gender-specific analysis and AD stratification of men and women, and identify new and experimentally validated AD genes. To carry out this program, AIM 1 will fuse a novel mathematical analysis of evolution with machine learning and network wavelet theory. This will yield complementary integrative approaches to identify genes and mutations that sort AD vs healthy subjects based on the abnormal mutational burden of rare gene variants in sequenced cohorts. AIM 2 will focus similar tools on patients and controls with known paradoxical phenotypes that run counter to their APOEɛ2/4 status. The results will identify modifier genes that drive AD in APOEɛ2 carriers or that protect APOEɛ4 carriers from AD. AIM 3 will provide direct experimental validation, leveraging high-throughput, robot-assisted genetic modifier screening in Drosophila models of Tau or amyloid-beta peptide neurotoxicity. Promising targets will be further confirmed in mammalian neuronal cell culture. The work will validate a new approach to enlarge our understanding of genetic complexity in Alzheimer’s Disease for the identification of gene drivers and modifiers to guide clinical assessment of AD risk stratification. Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer’s Disease Genes and Risk Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is devastating and its social and economic impact is projected to rise dramatically. Here, in order to discover genes that underlie its mechanisms and clinical risk, we fuse a new mathematical and machine learning framework with experimental testing in diverse models. The outcome will integrate vast amounts of data from evolution, from genome sequencing from experiments and from patients to guide clinical assessment of risk and open new paths for understanding the disease and for drug development.",Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer's Disease Genes and Risk,10219658,U01AG068214,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer associated neurodegeneration', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Back', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Calculi', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Fogs', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoblotting', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Impacts', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive computing', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder control', 'drug development', 'economic impact', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'gene discovery', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic variation', 'human data', 'in vivo evaluation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning network', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuropathology', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'risk stratification', 'robot assistance', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2021,799998
"The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Genomic studies for late-onset AD (LOAD) have identified over 20 risk loci; however, translating the relevant molecules identified by genomics to AD-specific mechanistic pathways has been challenging. Our application, entitled “The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline Revealed by Next- Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,” is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing a uniquely innovative molecular imaging platform called multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) that will determine high dimensional protein interactions for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomics studies in normal and pathological states. Our proposal has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze four regions in healthy aged brains: two sectors of the hippocampal pyramidal layer and from two isocortical regions. Next- generation MIBI instrumentation will be used to image simultaneously 30+ proteins that mark subtypes of neurons, synapses, and non-neuronal cells, while covering regulatory signaling, neuro-inflammatory components, and AD risk gene protein products with subcellular resolution. In Aim 2, we propose to use the same multiplexed imaging methods in AD brain stratified by APOE genotype. We will analyze these data with statistical machine learning methods already established in our laboratory, similar to what we have done previously with different cancers and the immune system. In Aim 3, using infrastructure we have already have established, we will create a web-based portal where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi- color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features we derive shared freely. We propose a transformative, collaborative approach to AD that leverages a long-standing NIA-funded longitudinal cohort and is highly responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan. These novel insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets and will create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD. Project Narrative AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate a phenotypic landscape of cognitive decline, to understand modulation of cognitive decline during compensation and relate genetic predisposition to changes in phenotypic landscape defined by muti-parametric measurements using enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI).  ",The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,10173583,R01AG056287,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Electrons', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Middle frontal gyrus structure', 'Molecular', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'burden of illness', 'collaborative approach', 'computational pipelines', 'data repository', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'gene product', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning method', 'mental state', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'symposium', 'web portal']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,502002
"Towards a better understanding of genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease with human iPSC models PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia with high heritability (~70%). It is increasingly clear that AD is highly polygenic, and for most of AD cases it is the polygenicity of the risk variants across the genome that predisposes the disease risk. In contrast to the rapid identification of risk loci associated with AD by recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), identifying the potential causal variants/genes at the reported risk loci and decoding these variants/genes into molecular and cellular pathology have lagged far behind. Since disease variants, mostly locating in noncoding regions of the human genome, have been shown to affect cellular function through multi-level regulations such as DNA accessibility and histone modifications, DNA methylation and RNA expression in a cell type-specific manner, comprehensive and unbiased investigating the cell type-specific influence of generic risk variants on AD risk at multiple levels, including epigenomic, transcriptomic, and cellular levels, in an isogenic background is crucial to understand the genetic basis of AD pathogenesis. In the current application, by combining human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with gene editing and comprehensive multi-omics and cellular analyses, we will dissect the AD genetic risk variants into cell type-specific molecular and cellular pathology. Given the polygenic nature of AD, and the heterogeneity of AD risk genes on the cellular level, we hypothesize that multiple genetic risk variants act synergistically among different compartments (e.g. cell types) to contribute to pathogenesis of AD. First, we will identify AD risk variants and genes with comprehensive analyses of AD genetic architecture using machine learning approaches including DVAR, eVAR and iRIGS (Aim 1). Second, we will delineate the cell type-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures associated with AD candidate risk variants using human iPSC-derived neurons/microglia/astrocytes (Aim 2). Last, we will determine the functional impact of AD candidate risk variants on AD-like cellular pathology in neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and their co-cultures (Aim 3). Our proposal may advance our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of AD, leading to a better understanding of AD pathogenesis and facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia with high heritability. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AD have identified more than 20 risk loci, the genetic etiology of AD leading to molecular and cellular pathology remains largely unknown. By combining human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with gene editing and comprehensive multi-omics and cellular analyses, our investigation will reveal the cell type-specific effects of AD genetic risk variants on AD pathogenesis, which may advance our understanding of genetic architecture of AD and disease etiology, and lead to therapeutic advances.",Towards a better understanding of genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease with human iPSC models,10231253,R01AG065611,"['ATAC-seq', 'Abeta synthesis', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer like pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cell Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Conformation Capture and Sequencing', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium Mapping', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain tissue', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'cellular pathology', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'molecular pathology', 'multiple omics', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'risk variant', 'synaptic function', 'tau aggregation', 'tau phosphorylation', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,767099
"US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although dementia has a global impact, efforts to address ensuing challenges have come mostly from high- income countries (HICs). Whereas the prevalence and incidence of dementia appear to be stable or declining in such countries, an alarmingly opposite tendency typifies South American countries (SAC). This scenario proves even more challenging due to region-specific traits. First, the particular genetic and environmental backgrounds of SAC limit the generalizability of key findings from HICs. Moreover, the greater genetic diversity and impact of socioeconomic status (SES) of SAC remain markedly understudied. Of note, this is true of the four largest SAC (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), representing over 75% of the region’s population. In addition, SAC face a dearth of innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional studies on two of their most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is thus critical for SAC to join ongoing international efforts and develop a gold-standard approach for detecting disease-specific alterations in a context of methodological, genetic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity. Against this background, our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD presentation in SAC relative to the US. To this end, we will establish a cohort to test large samples from the four abovementioned SAC, as well as the US (totaling > 3000 participants, including 1500 controls, 750 AD patients, and 750 FTD patients). We will combine standardized clinical assessments with innovative analytical techniques including multimodal machine learning to account for heterogeneity in these diverse populations. By combining standardized genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (SES-cognitive) measures, we will test the underlying hypothesis that there are unique risk factors for AD and FTD in SAC which do not prove significant in US populations. More particularly, we will aim to (a) establish genetic risk to AD and FTD in diverse SAC cohorts; (b) test whether patients from SAC and the US can be discriminated after accounting for how SES affects cognitive and brain imaging signatures; and (c) determine genetic, cognitive, cerebral, and socioeconomic factors that discriminate among SAC vs. US patients. Positive impacts of this work include a better understanding of the genetic and socioeconomic factors driving neurocognitive manifestations of dementia, and the identification of novel genetic targets for risk reduction and disease prevention in SAC. Our large multimodal, cross-sectional study will enable clinical assessment of understudied patient groups, extend and harmonize existing data sets, and prompt the development of novel measures and multimodal machine learning protocols. More generally, by establishing a collaborative framework which capitalizes on unique regional populations, our proposal can consolidate a SAC-based platform for future translational research and assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although the prevalence and incidence of dementia appears to be stable or declining in high-income countries, South American countries (SAC) face the opposite scenario, with increased dementia prevalence, probably triggered by a combination of genetic and socioeconomic status (SES) factors. This proposal aims to create the first SAC-based multicenter initiative to study dementia, by combining genomic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (cognitive, clinical, socioeconomic) data. This project constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to foster regional synergy and multilevel research towards the harmonization of global strategies to fight dementia in SAC.",US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research,10239263,R01AG057234,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Argentina', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Brain imaging', 'Brazil', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Colombia', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Education', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Status', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Indigenous', 'International', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South American', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'disorder prevention', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fighting', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lipid metabolism', 'low socioeconomic status', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'synergism', 'trait']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,521480
"Exploring Common Biological Pathways Underlying Insulin Resistance and Alzheimer Disease using Genetic and Omic Tools Project Summary / Abstract Insulin resistance (IR) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but the mechanisms by which IR predisposes to AD is unknown, notably, if IR is causally related to AD and which regulatory mechanisms underlie IR and contribute to AD. The proposal is designed to address these critical gaps in scientific knowledge by using omics to evaluate the causal relationship of IR on AD and to reveal new regulatory mechanisms involved in IR and AD. The Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Sarnowski, is a statistical geneticist and an early career investigator with a research focus on the identification of genetic and environmental risk factors of complex traits. The long-term goal of this project is to identify individuals who will benefit from treatments improving insulin sensitivity to better prevent, delay or stop the progression of AD. The overall objective is to better characterize mechanisms by which IR contributes to AD and evaluate how they may differ from known mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis. The central hypothesis is that omics will help to better understand and characterize the relationships between IR and AD. The rationale is that omics will help to disentangle the mode of action of IR on AD and identify targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions. Guided by strong preliminary results in the Framingham Heart Study, the hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims: 1) Determine if IR is causally related to AD in a Mendelian Randomization (MR) framework with various genetic instrument variables (IVs); 2) Characterize molecular signatures of IR associated with AD using brain and blood omic data; and 3) Develop a joint test to evaluate the genetic contribution at IR signatures associated with AD. In Aim 1, genetic IVs, including standard and pathway-specific genetic risk scores and predictors identified by machine learning, will be constructed to evaluate the causal relationships between IR and AD using various MR methods. In Aim 2, association analyses will be performed to identify brain and blood omic signatures of IR related to AD. In Aim 3, new integrative statistical methods leveraging annotations will be developed to evaluate the genetic contribution on omics at loci involved in IR and AD. Career development activities will include training in AD pathophysiology, multi-omic analysis and machine learning techniques through coursework, seminars, mentorship, and collaborations with a team of leading expert scientists. The approach is innovative by shifting focus to omics to study the regulatory mechanisms involved in IR and AD. The proposed research is significant as the expected outcomes will contribute to a better understanding of how insulin sensitivity can be improved to better prevent, delay or stop the progression of AD, reduce cognitive decline and prevalence of dementia due to AD, and promote brain health in late life. The experience acquired in achieving the aims of this grant will advance the PI’s career to an independent statistical geneticist with bioinformatics expertise, to dissect how vascular risk factors interact with genomics to influence AD and dementia susceptibility using large-scale omics. Project Narrative This research project aims to better characterize the biological mechanisms involved in insulin resistance and their role in Alzheimer’s disease. The proposed research is relevant to public health as it is expected to provide new ways to prevent, delay or treat Alzheimer’s disease, by targeting insulin sensitivity. Thus, the project is relevant to the part of the NIH’s mission that pertains to improving fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of complex human diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.",Exploring Common Biological Pathways Underlying Insulin Resistance and Alzheimer Disease using Genetic and Omic Tools,10126565,K99AG066849,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Apoptosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Bypass', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic resistance', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genomic locus', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'insulin sensitivity', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'religious order study', 'tau Proteins', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K99,2021,89564
"Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the complexity of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis and the associated co-morbid conditions, both the “depth” and the “width” of currently available drug repurposing solutions need to be improved in order to deliver effective AD therapeutic solutions. The depth of a drug-repurposing project refers to the level of understanding of disease mechanism and drug-target interactions across a wide searching space for the combination of dosage and treatment time. Achieving depth requires a reliable AD model system that comprehensively recapitulates AD pathogenesis in a human brain-like environment, and sophisticated transcriptomic profiles, which can reveal molecular-level changes underlying disease-reversing phenotypes across multiple treatment conditions. The width of a therapy search relies on the efficacy of predicting and validating effects of candidate compounds from an enormous search space. Width can be achieved from novel computational algorithms connecting –omics changes with phenotypic changes, thus guiding the search with improved knowledge on mechanisms and avoiding exhaustive testing of every available drug. Integrating the systems medicine and drug repositioning expertise of the Wong Lab at the Houston Methodist Research Institute of Houston Methodist Hospital with the Alzheimer's biology expertise of the Kim and Tanzi labs at Massachusetts General Hospital, we propose a SysteMatic Alzheimer's disease drug ReposiTioning (SMART) framework based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening. Reformatting a novel three- dimensional human neural stem cell culture model of AD (a.k.a. Alzheimer's in a dish) developed in the Kim and Tanzi labs for high content screening, the Wong lab screened 2,640 known drugs and bioactive compounds and obtained a panel of 38 primary hits that strongly inhibit β-amyloid-driven p-tau accumulation. We hypothesize that iteratively running relatively small screens with our novel 3D cell model and applying systematic artificial intelligence modeling to the transcriptomic profiles of the screening hits will allow us to: 1) quickly obtain a panel of robust novel drug candidates for AD, and 2) gain an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms from those repositioned drug candidates, which will subsequently improve the success rate of predicting novel hits. Using the primary 38 hits as a starting point, the SMART computational modules will update the existing NeuriteIQ software package to quantify the image data from high content screening; it will also incorporate publicly available big data transcriptomic profiles to predict candidate compounds inducing similar pathway changes as those original compounds, effectively expanding the search width to tens of thousands of compounds while only requiring functional validation of less than 100 drug candidates. The validated predictions will, in turn, add to the panel of known hits that will launch the next round of computational predictions and experimental validations, efficiently generating candidates for novel AD therapies (Aim 1). SMART's iterative prediction-validation scheme effectively connects more transcriptomic profiles to desirable phenotypic changes. Thus, we will apply systematic image-omics modeling to uncover novel mechanisms driving such phenotypes. For all the validated hits, dose-responses for the phenotype of pTau inhibition will be obtained using the 3D culture model; while the dose-responses for individual genes and pathways will be modeled through public and in-house generated transcriptomic profiles. We will use Partial Least Square Regression models to identify gene modules with matching dose-response curves as the phenotypes, thus allowing us to go beyond the confinement of canonical pathway maps and identify novel functional modules specifically related to phenotypes of interest (Aim 2). Selected compounds derived from the previous two aims will be evaluated in human neurons directly derived from AD patients and in animal models (Aim 3). Success of this work will lead to new AD therapeutic compounds ready for translation into clinical trials, as well as a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the SMART framework for drug repositioning will be generalizable to other big data and disease platforms. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) currently afflicts 5.3 million people in the United States alone. Beyond symptomatic treatments, no clear therapeutic options are available. The proposed study provides a systematic drug repositioning strategy that uses a novel 3D human neural culture model (Alzheimer's-in-a-dish) integrated with a computational platform that leverages publicly available toxicology and pharmokinetic big data. Success of the study will greatly reduce the cost of AD drug development, identify potential new disease mechanism, and facilitate quicker translation from bench to bedside. .",Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics,10173590,R01AG057635,"['3-Dimensional', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Methodist Church', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Institute', 'Running', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Width', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'comorbidity', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'drug repurposing', 'exhaustion', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'individual response', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symptom treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tau-1', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,689643
"Complexity of FMRI in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Considerable efforts have been spent in the past two decades to search for biomarkers for pre-symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For neuroimaging, amyloid-PET imaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is considered an early marker for the preclinical stage of AD, while tau-PET imaging correlates more closely with neuronal injury and cognitive decline. However, PET scans are expensive and involve radioactive tracers. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies in AD have shown that the functional connectivity (FC) of resting brain networks is progressively diminished in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. However, FC analysis of rs-fMRI has limited capability to characterize the dynamic fluctuations of rs-fMRI signals that possess clinically meaningful information. Our group and others have recently explored the use of entropy measures as indices of the complexity and regularity of rs-fMRI time-series. Accumulating data showed decreasing entropy values associated with aging, APOE ɛ4 genotype, cognitive decline in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD). Our group began developing the Complexity Toolbox in 2013 as the first systematic and comprehensive software package dedicated to complexity analysis of neuroimaging (fMRI) data. In particular, a recent independent study using our toolbox to analyze the rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study reported progressive reductions of entropy from healthy controls, early MRI, to late MCI and AD groups, with significant associations between complexity measures of rs-fMRI and cognitive decline in MCI/AD subjects. Our preliminary data in ADAD and LOAD subjects further showed consistent negative correlations between rs-fMRI entropy and tau-PET signal. The goal of this project is to further develop our Complexity Toolbox and a cloud-based pipeline for comprehensive complexity analysis of (large scale) fMRI data. We will systematically evaluate the complexity of fMRI as a novel imaging marker of AD in both ADAD and LOAD populations, using 3 public databases of rs- fMRI and PET including Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), Connectome of ADAD, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3) with a total sample size >900. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning techniques to evaluate complexity of rs-fMRI as a predictor for transversion from healthy to MCI and to AD. We will generate a disease staging model based on multimodal AD biomarkers including PET, CSF and rs-fMRI measures. We hypothesize that the complexity of BOLD signals provides an index of the information processing capacity of regional neuron populations, and is therefore sensitive to tau- related neuronal injury and cognitive decline in the AD processes. The successful completion of this project will lead to a noninvasive, economical and alternative imaging biomarker of neuronal injury in MCI and AD with relevant tools ready to be deployed in clinical research and care of AD. Relevance to Public Health Biomarkers for pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become increasingly important for the development of preventative interventions. For neuroimaging, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein provide early imaging markers of AD and can track disease progression but are expensive and require the use of radioactive tracers. This project aims to develop and evaluate a noninvasive, quantitative and economical imaging marker of AD based on the complexity or regularity of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).",Complexity of FMRI in Alzheimer's Disease,10137871,R01AG066711,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Entropy', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inherited', 'Ions', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'abeta accumulation', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'functional MRI scan', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'mutation carrier', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'tau Proteins', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,653961
"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults with who are at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and the reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to assess day-to-day functioning in a new way which will more effectively identify the subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence.",Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease,10190756,R01AG058687,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'functional decline', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'normal aging', 'pre-clinical', 'prodromal Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'remote monitoring', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'time use']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,527026
"SCAN: Standardized Centralized Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Neuroimaging PROJECT SUMMARY Amyloid PET is central to a biological definition of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and has been integrated heavily into the research setting since the first PIB-PET scans in 2004. The SCAN-Amyloid Legacy (SCAN-AL) Project will leverage already established research programs (SCAN, NACC, LONI) along with extensive work that has been conducted over the previous 15 years at the ADRC site level to implement and collect expensive and valuable amyloid PET data on ADRC research participants. The ultimate goal of this effort is to curate and harmonize pre-existing amyloid PET data collected across ADRC sites to create a large-scale resource that can be disseminated to the ADRC community for use in various research endeavors. More specifically, during this award period we will aim to curate 3000 amyloid PET scans, which is similar to the number of amyloid PET scans currently available through ADNI, and to link this data to extensive data already available on these participants (clinical and cognitive data, biofluid data, postmortem data, etc). Whereas the parent SCAN award focuses on processing of prospective PET and MRI data utilizing rigorous standardization methods both during image acquisition and post-acquisition processing, SCAN-AL will allow more flexibility to enable the specific goal of obtaining legacy amyloid PET data on as many unique ADRC Clinical Core participants as possible. This work is significant because we are quickly approaching 2025 and still lack a disease modifying treatment for AD. The data leveraging proposed herein extends the value of the considerable funding has been directed towards cohort studies of AD to contribute towards this goal of curing AD by 2025. Increasing the utilization of pre-existing amyloid PET dataset across ADRCs is particularly significant and unique compared to other large-scale efforts such as ADNI, given the heterogeneity in ADRC participants both in terms of clinical diagnoses and demographics. Whereas ADNI focuses specifically on normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD diagnoses, the ADRC program recruits participants spanning a range of neurodegenerative diseases that reflect the focus and expertise of local investigators, such as vascular disease, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, Parkinson’s, etc. Further, the ADRC program is unique in that a broad range of demographics regarding race, ethnicity, and age are reflected. We anticipate that the SCAN-AL Project will contribute to timely scientific opportunities related to the validation of plasma AD biomarkers, support innovative analyses that require large datasets such as work with genetics and machine learning, as well as enable the investigation of rare phenotypes that are difficult to collect at one site alone. This effort will provide ample opportunities to AD investigators and complement the efforts of the SCAN initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE (no changes from original submission) The field of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research has entered the era of “big data”, where large, multicenter data sets have contributed greatly to our understanding of the clinical variability, epidemiology, and genetics of the disease. This project will create an infrastructure for obtaining standardized brain images that can be combined across the 30 Alzheimer’s Disease Centers to create a very large database. Because imaging has become an integral part of the assessment of patients with AD, this work will advance our capabilities for performing high quality research on virtually any topic in this field that is related to brain imaging.",SCAN: Standardized Centralized Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Neuroimaging,10335694,U24AG067418,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injections', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Sum', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tracer', 'Traction', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'amyloid pathology', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'corticobasal syndrome', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'disease phenotype', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tau Proteins', 'virtual', 'willingness']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U24,2021,641593
"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET-positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations), 200 subjects meeting clinical criteria with negative amyloid PET (EOnonAD) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). EOnonAD participants and controls will also receive [18]FDG PET. All participants are followed annually (controls up to 24 months; impaired participants up to 48 months). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD and EOnonAD and compare to age-matched controls and sex and stage- matched LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. Additionally, we will characterize demographic, clinical, neuroimaging, and fluid biomarker measures in EOnonAD cases to explore the possible etiologies of cognitive impairment. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow 600 people with EOAD and related disorders in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS),10219685,U01AG057195,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Atrophic', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Italy', 'Language', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Presenile Alzheimer Dementia', 'Psychometrics', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'biomarker development', 'brain tissue', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical outcome measures', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genetic risk factor', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'neurofilament', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'presenilin-1', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment trial']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2021,1072053
"NOVEL EXOSOME BIOMARKERS OF IRON PATHOLOGY IN AD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) afflicts millions of Americans, yet no effective treatments exist. Iron has been shown to be involved in key AD pathologic processes, including amyloid and tau aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death mechanisms. Despite this growing evidence, it is challenging to ascertain alterations in iron metabolism in vivo, limiting potential translation to biomarkers and novel therapies. Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles shed by cells to transport proteins, nucleic acids, metals, lipids or metabolites. While exosomes reflect cellular processes and can reveal disease-related pathologies in human tissues and biofluids, iron abnormalities in AD exosomes have not yet been investigated. We will address this knowledge gap through state-of-the-art exosome isolation technology combined with advanced iron imaging, protein quantification and next generation sequencing methods. Our goal is to investigate iron dysregulation in exosomes from post- mortem AD brains, in order to unveil AD-specific biomarkers and facilitate the development of novel therapies.  The project aims are: (1) To determine whether the quantity, oxidation state, and cellular origin of exosomal iron is altered in AD. Using MRI and synchrotron X-ray microscopy, we will quantify tissue iron content and oxidation state in human AD and control hippocampal specimens. We will then use our novel exosome isolation platform, ExoTIC, to isolate exosomes from regions of high hippocampal iron content in the same specimens. Using antibodies that target cell-surface proteins, we will enrich the isolated exosomes based on their cellular origin (e.g. neurons, microglia, etc.). We will quantify exosomal iron content from each cell type using mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and measure exosomal iron oxidation state using electron microscopy. Taken together, we will determine whether iron content and oxidation state are altered in Alzheimer’s exosomes compared to controls, in particular in exosomes originating in microglia, the brain’s immune cells. (2) Detect dysregulation of iron-related proteins and RNAs in AD exosomes. Using Western blotting on the enriched exosomes, we will determine whether levels of proteins that play a role in iron metabolism are altered in AD compared to controls. Because exosomes are generally rich in microRNAs that are known to regulate gene expression, we will use RNA-Seq to determine whether exosomal microRNAs regulating these same iron-related proteins are also altered in AD. Machine learning algorithms will enable the creation of an atlas of microRNAs linking iron, iron-related proteins, and neuropathology, which should provide a deeper understanding of AD biology.  Characterization of exosome content in the AD brain should result in cell-specific signatures of iron dysregulation associated with neurodegeneration. This approach may elucidate novel aspects of AD biology, lead to novel assays to detect early AD, and facilitate a much-needed future therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence and cost, investigations focusing on abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) have yet to yield an efficacious treatment, so alternative mechanisms need to be investigated. Iron dysregulation is widespread in AD yet is difficult to quantify in living humans using existing methods: we propose to investigate iron dysregulation using exosomes, tiny vesicles shed from brain cells that offer unique information on active cellular processes. Using a novel exosome isolation platform integrated with advanced iron imaging and next generation sequencing, we will identify signatures of iron dysregulation associated with brain cells in AD, which can provide novel pharmaceutical targets towards a much-needed future therapy.",NOVEL EXOSOME BIOMARKERS OF IRON PATHOLOGY IN AD,10223789,R21AG072675,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Astrocytes', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Ceruloplasmin', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electron energy loss spectroscopy', 'Exhibits', 'Ferritin', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pensions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproducibility', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Synchrotrons', 'TFRC gene', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transferrin', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vesicle', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'X ray microscopy', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'disorder control', 'divalent metal', 'effective therapy', 'efficacious treatment', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'hepcidin', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intercellular communication', 'iron metabolism', 'iron oxidation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metal transporting protein 1', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oxidation', 'population based', 'specific biomarkers', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,433029
"Genetic and molecular correlates of white matter pathology in Alzheimers disease PROJECT SUMMARY: Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typically defined by the accumulation of beta- amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration, the disease is not restricted to the gray matter. Neuroimaging and neuropathological studies have documented a significant loss of white matter in AD, which begins early in the disease course and is correlated with cognitive decline. In addition to contributions of hypoperfusion-related ischemic injury and neurodegeneration-associated axonal loss, emerging evidence indicates a decline and dysfunction of oligodendrocyte populations as additional factors in this multifactorial white matter disease process. Oligodendrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type in the brain, but are the least studied cell population in the context of neurodegeneration despite their vital role for myelin maintenance and neuronal support. With the increasing recognition of the role of myelin in AD, it becomes important to understand the genetic and molecular factors that link oligodendrocytes to the AD process. Our knowledge about genetic variants contributing to overall AD risk and influencing AD-associated endophenotypes is accelerating. Our proposal is designed to bring these two lines of investigation together and begin to explore genetic modifiers of oligodendrocyte and myelin abnormalities in AD and underlying molecular mechanisms using a quantitative trait approach of neuropathologically defined myelin endophenotypes.  The central hypothesis of our proposal is that loss of myelin integrity and oligodendrocyte dysfunction in AD are associated with genetic variants and molecular changes. We will test this hypothesis by first performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of white and gray matter neuropathological endophenotypes in human postmortem brain tissue samples and will then conduct bulk and spatially defined gene expression studies to explore underlying molecular mechanisms. Our experiments are divided into two specific aims: Aim 1) To determine genetic modifiers of myelin and oligodendrocyte pathologies in AD. Aim 2) To determine associations between white matter gene expression changes and white matter pathologies in AD.  The above aims benefit from the tight integration and leveraging of a diverse group of investigators with expertise in the neuropathology of AD and digitally quantified pathology endophenotypes (PI Kofler), AD- associated oligodendrocyte pathology (Co-I Herrup), GWAS data analysis (Co-Is Kamboh and Fan), biostatistical analysis of transcriptomics datasets (Co-I Ding) and digital image analysis and machine learning (Co-I Pearce). Upon completion of our proposed studies, we will have identified novel candidate genes as mediators of myelin pathology in AD, increased our understanding about the biology underlying their linkage to AD and revealed novel targets for therapeutic interventions. As our study design includes separate analyses of gray and white matter regions and stratification by sex, we will have further delineated regional and sex- specific differences in myelin and oligodendrocyte pathobiology in the context of AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Alzheimer's disease is not restricted to the gray matter regions of the brain but also affects the white matter, and these changes contribute to cognitive decline. We propose to evaluate the contributions of genetic variants to the development of oligodendrocyte dysfunction and myelin integrity loss in Alzheimer’s disease using postmortem human tissue samples. We will then conduct gene expression studies to identify underlying molecular mechanisms.",Genetic and molecular correlates of white matter pathology in Alzheimers disease,10093220,R01AG069912,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Astrocytes', 'Attention', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Complement', 'DNA Damage', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Molecular', 'Myelin', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Optics', 'Pallor', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'SNP array', 'Sex Differences', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue Sample', 'White Matter Disease', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'abeta accumulation', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'cell population study', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'endophenotype', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'human tissue', 'hyperphosphorylated tau', 'hypoperfusion', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'interest', 'ischemic injury', 'nano-string', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'protein aggregation', 'regional difference', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'whole slide imaging']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,521155
"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology. The completion of our study aims will advance the development of an affordable screening tool that can be utilized in a clinical/community setting to identify individuals who are candidates for comprehensive diagnostic testing.",Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology,10174646,R01AG054523,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrum', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cost Measures', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical center', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'community clinic', 'community setting', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'glucose metabolism', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'ketogenic diet', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'minimally invasive', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'stem', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,746785
"Examine the risk of Alzheimer's disease in sexual and gender minorities ABSTRACT Although there is an increasing amount of research on the unique health issues that sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals face, prior studies on SGM health are still limited and have primarily focused on mental health, substance use and abuse, and sexual transmitted infections and diseases. In particular, few SGM studies have examined age-related chronic conditions such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the 2nd and 6th leading causes of death for Americans, respectively. Despite both being associated with aging, cancer and AD do not often occur together; nevertheless, they share a number of common risk factors such as obesity, especially social & behavioral determinants of health (SDoH & BDoH) that are more prevalent among SGMs. Considering that SGMs have different health risk profiles compared to non-SGMs, it is crucial that we examine how these two groups differ in cancer and AD risks and the associated risk factors for early prevention and better clinical prognostication. The proliferation of large clinical research networks (CRNs) of real-world data (RWD) including electronic health records (EHRs), claims, and billing data among others, offer unique opportunities to generate real-world evidence (RWE) that will have direct translational impacts on cancer and AD prevention and care in SGM populations.  In our parent award R21 CA245858-01A1, we proposed to: (1) develop computable phenotype (CP) algorithms to identify transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals (a subgroup of SGM) using RWD from OneFlorida—a large clinical data network covering 15 millions of Floridians as well as develop a NLP pipeline to extract cancer-related risk factors, and (2) conduct a population-based cohort analysis to estimate and compare cancer incidence and cancer risk factors between TGNC and non-TGNC individuals.  In this administrative supplement, we propose to (1) extend the TGNC CP to include sexual orientations (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual among others), and (2) conduct a retrospective study to examine whether SGMs and non-SGMs differ in cancer and AD risk, separately. Our aims are to: (1) develop phenotyping algorithms to accurately identify SGM individuals and extract risk factors associated with cancer and AD, leveraging both structured and unstructured EHR data; and (2) estimate and compare the cancer and AD incidences and risk factors in SGM versus non-SGM individuals. This admin supplement will (1) fill a gap as no population-based studies on SGMs’ cancer and AD risks exist; (2) create a large SGM cohort that can be tracked longitudinally by virtue of routine care, and (3) fill a critical gap in our understanding of SGMs’ risks and risk factors at the intersection of cancer and AD—setting the stage for our future studies on identifying the appropriate prevention strategies intersecting cancer and AD (e.g., whether certain cancer screening is adequate for SGMs with early signs of cognitive impairment and a high-risk of AD). PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project will fill an important gap in our knowledge of Alzheimer’s’ disease (AD) and cancer burden and their risk factors in sexual and gender minority (SGM) people. Computable phenotypes that can accurately identify SGM cohorts in large networks of electronic health records (EHRs) enables us to monitor SGM health longitudinally, which is significant for aging-related diseases such as AD and cancer.

"Muli-scale Structural Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology and Neurodegeneration Project Summary/Abstract. Advanced biomarker mapping has led to the current understanding that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an extremely complex neurodegenerative disorder, with substantial heterogeneity in temporal and spatial characteristics of the classical amyloid and tau pathologies and resultant neurodegeneration among patients (as described by the amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration, ‘A-T-N’ biological framework that is the new standard for characterizing the neuropathology of AD). This complexity is a major barrier to clinical care and to the development of effective therapies, highlighting the importance of integrated biomarker neuromapping for understanding AD. However, substantial challenges remain in the neuropathologic characterization of patients. Current procedures for mapping the neurodegenerative component (N) of AD are limited in sensitivity to early pathology. Additionally, the specific biomarkers of the amyloid- and tau-based primary AD neuropathologies are only available through relatively invasive and/or expensive positron emission tomography (PET) and lumbar puncture (LP) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) procedures in specialized laboratories and clinics. We aim here to advance AD neuropathology mapping on multiple levels: 1) we will implement a novel multi-scale structural mapping (MSSM) MRI procedure for sensitive quantification of the neurodegeneration component of AD; 2) we will use the MSSM procedure to differentially predict amyloid and/or tau positivity in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, providing a highly accessible method for pathology detection when advanced biomarkers are not available; 3) we will create individualized ‘A-T-N’ brainmaps through the integration of the MSSM metrics with existing PET amyloid and tau data; and 4) we will use MSSM features for the regional prediction of amyloid and tau pathology for use when PET data are not available. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To test the accuracy of a novel MSSM procedure for probabilistic classification of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals as being amyloid “positive” or tau “positive.” Hypothesis 1a (H1a). We hypothesize that MSSM ‘N’ metric can be used with a high level of sensitivity to predict whether an individual is A+ measured via PET using standard thresholds and/or T+ measured via PET using standard thresholds, or both. H1b. MSSM will provide better separation of individuals as N+ vs. N- than conventional MRI-based atrophy measures, validated through concordance with molecular pathology and clinical progression. Aim 2. To utilize the novel MSSM features for synthesis of PET-like maps of AD neuropathologic change. H2a. MSSM features will provide accurate spatial prediction of specific regional neuropathologic changes. Prediction accuracy will be measured against independent in vivo datasets including a subset with autopsy confirmation and regional quantification of plaques, tangles, and neuronal loss. Successful MSSM implementation would greatly advance the ability to screen for early and complex AD neuropathology. Successful MSSM implementation would greatly advance the ability to screen for AD neuropathology. Project Narrative.

"Lens β-Amyloid Biomarker for Early Detection of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Study Recent research advances have led to detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and development of emerging disease-modifying therapies. Yet effective treatment remains elusive. Repeated failure of AD clinical trials has focused attention on preclinical AD that begins with clinically silent accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain and progresses to onset of cognitive symptoms. Early detection of preclinical AD is now recognized as a prerequisite for effective treatment. Aβ is an accepted “gold standard” AD biomarker. Available methods to assess Aβ burden rely on positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. These methods are expensive, invasive, cumbersome, not widely available, and difficult to scale. The NIA has identified development of new, safe, sensitive, cost-efficient, point-of-care technology to detect preclinical AD as a high-priority goal. This project addresses this unmet need by accelerating testing of an innovative drug-device combination eye scanner (Sapphire II) that detects AD-related Aβ in the lens. This novel approach is based on our discovery of AD-specific Aβ lens pathology in patients with pathologically-confirmed AD, but not other non-AD neurodegenerative diseases or normal aging. Moreover, we found that AD-related pathology and phenotypes are expressed far earlier in lens than brain in Framingham Eye Study participants. This and related research led to development of the Sapphire II system that combines a topically-applied Aβ-binding fluorescent ligand (Aftobetin) and a purpose-designed eye scanner with integrated fluorescent lifetime decay spectroscopy analyzer. The eye scanner and ligand reliably measure lens Aβ with high specificity, sensitivity, and signal-to-noise ratio. In Phase 2 clinical trials, the Sapphire II system showed high positive and negative predictive values for AD diagnosis and differentiated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and clinical AD from normal controls with greater sensitivity and specificity than amyloid-PET scans. This project leverages opportunistic timing of NHLBI-funded basic health exams by adding lens Aβ measurements in well- characterized, community-based longitudinal cohorts in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Specifically, we will evaluate lens Aβ burden in two older FHS cohorts (Aim 1; Gen 2, multi-ethnic OmniGen 1) and two middle-aged FHS cohorts (Aim 2; Gen 3, multi-ethnic OmniGen 2), each with longitudinal neuropsychological test battery results, concurrent MRI brains scans, and ancillary datasets relevant to cognitive decline and AD. Lens Aβ measurement will be evaluated using stratified analyses for age, sex, ApoE genotype, and AD risk factors (Aim 3) and computational modeling to construct multi-marker predictive profiles for AD (Aim 4). Results will be used to test our project hypothesis that lens Aβ burden will be elevated in middle-aged and older FHS participants who show evidence of cognitive decline (memory deficits, executive dysfunction), AD neuroimaging biomarkers, or clinical AD. Project results are expected to accelerate clinical introduction of lens Aβ burden as an objective measure to evaluate AD risk, detect preclinical AD, and assess early AD and progression in individual patients. This project will accelerate evaluation of an innovative drug-device combination eye scanner that specifically measures β-amyloid (Aβ) in the ocular lens for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We will test the project hypothesis that elevated Aβ burden in the lens is predictive of cognitive decline and early, pre- symptomatic (preclinical) AD in older and middle-aged longitudinal community-based cohorts in the Framingham Heart Study.",Lens β-Amyloid Biomarker for Early Detection of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Study,10214179,RF1AG072589,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain scan', 'Care Technology Points', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Cost of Illness', 'Crystalline Lens', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Fluorescence Spectroscopy', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sapphire', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Topical application', 'Woman', 'abeta accumulation', 'age group', 'amyloid pathology', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'beta amyloid pathology', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning algorithm', 'delta-catenin', 'design', 'detection platform', 'disease phenotype', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'genome wide association study', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'lens', 'medical schools', 'men', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging marker', 'non-demented', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'presenilin-1', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'white matter', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,RF1,2021,1682982
"Drug repositioning for Alzheimer's disease via genetics, electronic health records, and human iPSC models Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of  dementia in the United States. Unfortunately, there is no cure for AD. Drug discovery for AD has  suffered significant failures, many at late stage clinical trials, partly due to our poor  understanding of AD pathology and the lack of disease-relevant and human-relevant discovery and  development models. This calls for team efforts with diverse and complementary expertise to tackle  the challenges together, by developing innovative approaches from multiple angles to achieve the  goal of identifying AD drugs.  In this application, we propose three complementary  Specific Aims that together aim to identify  FDA approved drugs with repurpose potential for AD, from distinct but complementary angles that act  synergistically to boost the likelihood of success. AD is a highly heritable disease, with an  estimated heritability of 70%, highlighting the critical role of genetics in understanding  the  disease etiology. Recent genetic studies have identified over 30 loci, enabling us to dissect the  genetic architecture of AD, including the biological processes and cell types involved in disease  etiology. In particular, we aim to dissect the highly polygenic AD etiology into distinct  pathophysiological components to guide drug repurposing,  which is only feasible in recent years  thanks to large scale GWAS and massive genomics data available publicly (Aim 1). In parallel, we  will mine millions of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify drugs that reduce AD risk and  cognitive decline, by developing phenotyping algorithms from EHR for AD related phenotypes (Aim 2).  In addition, we will develop a high­ throughput screening (HTS) gene expression profiling assay and  use human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models to identify candidate compounds, and will  further test the efficacy of the candidates in both patient-derived iPSC lines and AD mouse models  (Aim 3). The three aims are complementary  and synergistic, in the sense that they independently   tackle the same problem from drastically distinct angles, while findings from one can be served as  validation for others. Altogether, leveraging distinct and complementary  expertise, we expect to  yield bona fide repurposable drugs for AD with orthogonal support. Project Narrative: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia in the United States. Unfortunately, there is no cure for AD, and drug discovery for AD has suffered significant failures. In this application we aim to identify and validate drugs that are approved for other diseases to treat AD, via genetics, electronic health records and human iPSC models.","Drug repositioning for Alzheimer's disease via genetics, electronic health records, and human iPSC models",10099798,R01AG069900,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Microglia', 'Mitochondria', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Presenile Alzheimer Dementia', 'Production', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Text', 'United States', 'Validation', 'case control', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer framework', 'cytokine', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug repurposing', 'drug use screening', 'efficacy testing', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'model development', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'presenilin-1', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sex', 'single cell sequencing', 'stem cell model', 'success', 'tau phosphorylation', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,838304
"Reconstructing the temporal landscape of gene regulation in aging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The circadian rhythm orchestrates a vast repertoire of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes with a 24-hour period. A clock circuit, driven by the oscillatory activation and repression of a set of core clock genes, is present in every cell and regulates the expression of nearly half the genome across all tissues. Abundant epi- demiological evidence links circadian regulation to human health. In particular, sleep and circadian disruption is associated with neurodegeneration, where it is thought to be both a consequence and a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the most common form of dementia in the elderly, AD is rapidly becoming a public health cri- sis, affecting an estimated 5.5M people in the United States (24M world-wide) and is expected to double over the next 20 years. Addressing this crisis requires a deep understanding of disease mechanisms and the identiﬁcation of diagnostic/therapeutic targets. A wealth of existing transcriptomic data, coupled with the development of sophisticated computational tools for temporal reconstruction and analysis, provide an exciting opportunity to identify dysregulation in oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and AD.  We propose to develop novel computational strategies to decipher the oscillatory patterns of gene expression using existing untimed transcriptomic datasets; and to apply them to existing data from studies of AD to identify dysregulation in the oscillatory patterns associated with AD. Our methods address a number of analytical chal- lenges, including the need to reconstruct temporal information from untimed samples; ensuring generalizability and accuracy across different transcriptomic proﬁling technologies; addressing the fact that untimed samples may not span the full day; and identifying changes in complex, non-sinusoidal rhythms. Together, these studies will reveal oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and Alzheimers disease, and will provide innovative new methods for the circadian analysis of untimed data that can be applied to other phenotypes. NARRATIVE The circadian rhythm orchestrates critical physiological functions at the molecular, cell, and organismal levels. While degradation of the circadian rhythm is known to be associated with aging and believed to contribute to Alzheimer's and other age-related diseases, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly characterized. This project aims to develop and apply powerful computational tools to investigate circadian patterns of gene activity in older adults, with the goal of enabling personalized circadian medicine for an aging population.",Reconstructing the temporal landscape of gene regulation in aging,10261481,R01AG068579,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Older Population', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Repression', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Systems Theory', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'new technology', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387178
"Roles of Gray Matter Brain Aging and Small Vessel Disease in AD Pathophysiology In this Yr16 renewal of our longitudinal study on the natural progression of AD biomarkers, the central goal remains to further understand the occurrence of asymptomatic amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau deposition and the progression to clinical cognitive impairment. This cohort has now matured to the point that there is now sufficient longitudinal follow-up to address important hypotheses that were formulated from the beginning of this study but could not be properly addressed until 10-15 years of follow-up were in place - as is the case now. In this renewal period we aim to better characterize the different roles gray matter brain aging and small vessel disease have on AD progression. Chronological age is the most salient risk factor for late-onset AD. However, it remains unclear what components of the aging process account for this risk. In this proposal, we use gray matter brain age models to study the atrophy-related components of aging and 7T vascular imaging to characterize the SVD components of aging. Aim 1 uses this estimated gray matter brain age to explain individual differences in AD biomarkers and cognitive decline. Aim 2 uses fMRI and cerebrovascular imaging at 7T to examine the role of SVD in accelerating the amyloid-induced tauopathy and neurodegeneration. Aim 3 ties together brain aging and SVD to test components of a model that small vessel disease (SVD) accelerates Tau deposition and neurodegeneration (including accelerated gray matter brain aging). Over the last 2 years we have transitioned the MR imaging of this study to a 7T MR scanner to take advantage of its high field strength for 1) characterizing small vessel morphology (e.g., early markers of cerebrovascular disease) associated with AD risk and 2) characterizing functional neural systems (fMRI). Over the course of this study we have shown that many (~25%) of cognitively unimpaired older adults have significant cerebral amyloid deposition, subsequently defined as preclinical AD. We and others have shown that in this preclinical stage, cross-sectional Ab burden is only weakly associated with objective cognitive performance. At this early disease stage, Ab burden is more strongly associated with changes in the functional connectivity, which can be measured by fMRI. We and others have identified that regional medial temporal lobe functional connectivity (MTL_FC) during memory encoding is associated with increased Ab load. In recent preliminary work, we have found that traditional markers of SVD interact with amyloid burden in their relationship to MTL_FC. Those with high Ab and high White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) burden have particularly high regional MTL_FC. In individuals with Ab burden, SVD accelerates tau deposition, neurodegeneration, and progression of cognitive and clinical decline. The current cohort of 70 active participants will be supplemented by recruitment of additional older adults to achieve 200 baseline assessments. Individuals will undergo 3 MRI scans and 2 Ab- and tau-PET scans over a 32-month interval. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study was one of the first to demonstrate that cerebral amyloid deposition precedes cognitive decline by as much as 10-15 years. There appears to be great variability in the time from becoming amyloid positive until cognitive decline. Longitudinal studies, such as this one, which has been going on for 15 years, provide a unique opportunity to characterize the progression to Alzheimer’s disease.",Roles of Gray Matter Brain Aging and Small Vessel Disease in AD Pathophysiology,10119472,RF1AG025516,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Tauopathies', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'abeta deposition', 'age difference', 'age effect', 'aging brain', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'memory encoding', 'pre-clinical', 'processing speed', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'tau Proteins', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,RF1,2021,5546075
"Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade Abstract Enormous effort has been made to uncover the series of changes in biomarkers along Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiological pathway and its later clinical manifestations. The most influential hypothetical model proposed by Jack and colleagues has greatly shaped AD research in the past decade, whereas it remains a hypothesis to be validated. The key challenge in the validation is the fact that AD pathophysiological process is not directly observable. The temporal biomarker profile is therefore usually examined against discrete clinical diagnoses, estimated years from clinical symptom onset or test score of cognitive impairment – neither is a good measure of the AD pathogenic process, but merely clinical consequences that have been shown to vary greatly among individuals and also to be affected by other diseases. In this proposal, we will tackle this topic in the following aspects. (1) We will develop appropriate statistical models that directly address the unobservable nature of the AD pathophysiological process and therefore provide the foundation to operationalize and validate hypothetical AD biomarker models. (2) We will utilize data across multiple AD database to provide data-based evidence on the AD biomarker cascade and its clinical manifestations, as well as inform the link between the newly proposed biological AD definition in the 2018 NIA-AA research guideline and the current syndromic AD definition. (3) We will develop a statistical framework for dynamic prediction of AD pathophysiological progression trajectory and its clinical manifestations based on the history of a patient’s biomarker profiles. (4) We will develop a web-based application that allows for expedited delivery of statistical learning into practice. Although the scientific questions are focused, the proposed statistical model is applicable to many observational studies with longitudinal, multivariate biomarker measures to capture an unobservable structure, such as in aging or mental health studies. Narrative The project develops appropriate statistical methodologies to evaluate temporal biomarker changes along a pathophysiological process that cannot be directly observed, bridge the gap between a rigorous evaluation and the practical constraints using existing data sources, and attempt to provide individualized prediction of a patient’s future progression trajectory and associated clinical manifestations based on the biomarker history of this patient. Methods are motivated by the need to understand the series of changes in biomarkers along the Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiological pathway during the asymptotic stage and its later clinical manifestations, but can be applied to many biomarker studies where the outcome is not directly observable, such as in aging or mental health studies.",Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade,10260514,R01AG068002,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention Trial', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sigmoid colon', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'multiple data sources', 'neuroimaging', 'patient biomarkers', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'semiparametric', 'software development', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'therapeutic development', 'user-friendly']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,409375
"Combine Genomics and Symptoms Data Driven Models to Discover Synergistic Combinatory Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary In 2018, an estimated 5.7 million people have Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or a related dementia in the U.S., with related healthcare costs of ~$277 billion1. However, there is no cure yet for AD. One major challenge is that the complicated pathogenesis of AD remains unclear, though >42 genes/loci have been associated with AD2,3. These genes are not actionable or druggable yet for AD management2. Over 240 drugs were tested in clinical trials but no new drugs have been approved for AD since 20031,4. The failure of these drugs is likely, in part, due to the limited efficacy of single agents to treat AD that is a genetically complex, multifactorial disease2, i.e., robust molecular signaling crosstalks among multi-pathways2,5,6,7,8,9, as well as complicated niche factors, e.g., oxidative stress10,11,12,13, and inflammation14,15,16, leading to neuron de-generation. Therefore, combination therapies eliminating these niche factors, and disrupting the dysfunctional signaling pathways and cross-talks, can be more effective than single agents for in AD patients. The goal of this study is to fill the gap of accelerating repositioning of combination therapies for AD using following novel genomics and symptoms data-driven models seamlessly integrating well designed iPSC Aβ AD models. The Washington University Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Knight-ADRC), has generated comprehensive omics data for a large group of AD samples. We propose to (in Aim 1) uncover core signaling pathways and crosstalks of ApoE4 genotype-specific AD subtypes via a novel signaling convergence network model, and consequently to discover synergistic Signaling Network Disruption drug combinations (SNDdc) via novel drug prediction models integrating heterogenous pharmacogenomics datasets. On the other hand, we propose to (in Aim 2) discover potential Neuron Protective drug combinations (NPdc) using electronic health records (EHR), available in BJC HealthCare system (includes 14 academic and community hospitals in Missouri and Illinois), of patients with brain injury diseases, especially Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), via a novel high-order poly-pharmacy efficacy and safety model. We hypothesize that acute brain damage in TBI will share the aforementioned key AD-related niche factors. Also because TBI patients often require multiple drugs daily (high-order poly-pharmacy use), we propose that TBI provides an appropriate model to study synergy and interactions of combination therapies that can ameliorate acute brain injury, and thus suggest potentially neuron protective combinations. Combinations in SNDdc and NPdc provide candidates for novel and effective AD treatment. To filter the false positives, we will (in Aim 3) utilize pooled CRISPR functional genomics and iPSC neurodegeneration model to identify key signaling genes, and validate combination therapies with ApoE4 genotype-specific iPSC Aβ models. Our new models represent a potential breakthrough in AD combination therapies discovery.

"CRCNS: Investigating Brain Dynamics through the Lens of Statistical Mechanics Synaptic dysfunction has been hypothesized to be one of the earliest brain changes in Alzheimer’s  disease (AD), leading to hyper-excitation in neuronal circuits. However, network changes related to age  and sex tend to overlap with disease neuropathology, increasing the difficulty of separating  disease-specific alterations from those related to normal aging trajectories in males and females. Indeed,  AD disproportionately affects women, who comprise two thirds of all persons diagnosed with AD dementia.  Leveraging resting state fMRI connectome and diffusion MRI-derived structural connectome, we will use a  novel hybrid resting-state structural connectome (rs-SC) to study excitation-inhibition balance. Recently,  using a group of cognitively normal APOE-ε4 carriers and age/gender matched non-carriers we  demonstrated a sex-by-age-by-phenotype interaction, with significant hyperexcitation with increasing age  only observable in women, but not in men. Further, hyperexcitation in female carriers began to exhibit at  age 50 in the anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal lobe regions, and the degree of  hyperexcitation is linked to compensatory recruitment of neuronal resources during a spatial learning  memory task.  In this proposal, we will characterize 1) sex-specific normative trajectories of excitation-inhibition balance  using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data, and 2) altered excitation-inhibition balance in  abnormal aging using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, as well as 3) further  test and validate our hyperexcitation framework in longitudinal mouse models of AD. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  In this proposal, we will develop novel computational tools to characterize hyper-excitation patterns in  aging and Alzheimer's Disease and validate our hyperexcitation framework on human data (ADNI and  HCP) as well as longitudinal mouse models of AD. This will significantly improve our understanding of AD  and potentially accelerate the discovery of more robust non-invasive imaging biomarkers of AD. n/a",CRCNS: Investigating Brain Dynamics through the Lens of Statistical Mechanics,10222567,R01AG071243,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anterior', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Instruction', 'Knock-in', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase Transition', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Property', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Woman', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease classification', 'ferrite', 'genetic risk factor', 'human data', 'improved', 'lens', 'male', 'men', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropathology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'recruit', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,288746
"3D Reconstruction and Analysis of Alzheimer's Patient Biopsy Samples to Map and Quantify Hallmarks of Pathogenesis and Vulnerability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This project will expand the acquisition, reconstruction, analysis, and dissemination of 3D electron microscopic (3D EM) reference data, disclosing key ultrastructural details preserved within a remarkable collection of legacy biopsy brain samples from patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). These samples were originally collected, characterized and archived by neuropathologists R.D. Terry and N. Gonatas (at A. Einstein in the 1960’s), with later samples taken as part of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug infusion study involving S. Mirra (at Emory in the 1980’s). They were re-examined by Ellisman, Masliah, Terry, and Mirra in the 1980s, using early 3D EM methods, and were found to manifest excellent preservation of ultrastructure, showing paired helical filaments (PHF) and amyloid accumulations as well as modifications to subcellular organelles and cytoskeletons of the cell bodies, axonal and dendritic processes. Here, we will exploit recent advances in high throughput, automated 3D EM to massively scale the examination of these precious samples, reconstructing 100s of brain cells with and without PHF, tracking axons (and mapping glia and synapses) through much greater brain volumes than was feasible previously. Our goal is to target areas associated with both plaques and tangles, attending to locations where existing findings suggest cell and network vulnerability and contain molecular interactions suspected by some to underlie the initiation and progression of AD. Supporting investigations into the progression of soma/dendritic degeneration, we will target cells operationally defined to represent a progression of neuronal decline as seen in AD; determining the volume fraction of PHF in the cytoplasm as a practical staging measure and linking this to the characterization of quantitative changes in the microstructure of major subcellular constituents. Likewise, we will analyze the progression of axonal degeneration in and near plaques as data obtained suggests that axons may become dystrophic before their parent cell bodies and their dendrites degenerate. NARRATIVE This project will expand the acquisition, reconstruction, analysis, and immediate dissemination of 3D electron microscopic (3D EM) reference data, disclosing key ultrastructural details preserved within a remarkable collection of legacy biopsy brain samples from patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Our focus is to examine regions of acute interest, based on our own observations and insight offered from current AD literature, at a resolution sufficient to quantitatively assess suggested markers of AD-associated pathogenesis, link to biochemical data on molecular structures from studies on humans and mouse models of AD, and motivate future hypothesis driven research.",3D Reconstruction and Analysis of Alzheimer's Patient Biopsy Samples to Map and Quantify Hallmarks of Pathogenesis and Vulnerability,10115568,R01AG065549,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Cytoplasm', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Electrons', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Human', 'Infusion procedures', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microtubules', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurites', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Synapses', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axonal degeneration', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cellular imaging', 'cellular targeting', 'convolutional neural network', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'electron tomography', 'human model', 'image archival system', 'imaging Segmentation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'open source', 'paired helical filament', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'web portal']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,747767
"MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but has no effective prevention or treatment. The brain proteome, ascertained in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have proven to be a rich source of information, reflecting Aβ plaques deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal injury and inflammation, and have helped the enrollment of participants in clinical trials. Still, additional non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers are critical for the early detection, disease intervention and monitoring. Novel biomarkers may also help identify and characterize the additional aspects of AD, such as rate of progression and age at onset. Although genetic studies have focused on the identification of variants associated with risk through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome and exome sequencing projects, the genetic factors modulating these additional aspects of AD are less investigated. The current proposal focuses on these understudied aspects of disease etiology, namely the role of common and rare genetic variation on quantitative diagnostic and prognostic endophenotypes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will develop a unique resource – the proteome ascertained in a plasma, CSF and brain for a large number of samples – that will allow us to leverage unbiased approaches to reveal novel biomarkers and endophenotypes associated with AD and complex traits. We will utilize Mendelian Randomization to identify causal proteins involved in AD and extend our studies to other complex traits. We will use GWAS, exome-chip, whole-exome and whole-genome sequences to identify single variants, genes and pathways associated with plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain protein levels of AD biomarkers. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with devastating personal, familial, societal and economical burdens, and there is currently no effective means of prevention or treatment. If successful, our research will reveal novel intermediate traits and genetic variants involved in AD and other complex traits, potentially leading to prospective therapeutic targets, and will also provide guidelines for accurate and practical assessments of AD status, which will be invaluable for evaluations of effectiveness of experimental treatments in clinical trials.",MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS,10221566,R01AG057777,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'TREM2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical risk', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'participant enrollment', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,757923
"Microglia models for Alzheimer's disease drug screening PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disease marked by a progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions, resulting in profound dementia. AD is the most common late-onset dementia affecting millions of people in the developed countries of the world and the AD population predicted to reach 130 million by 2050. There has been a concerted effort to identify the mechanism of disease, development of models and therapeutics. In AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, the observations of uncontrolled chronic inflammatory pathology in the CNS and genetic associations of immune pathways have implicated the microglia. The microglia are the key immune cells in the CNS which provide immunesurveillance, secrete inflammatory molecules, and clear cell debris from the extracellular space. In AD, there is an uncoupling of microglial activation and phagocytosis functions suggesting that these cells are targets for AD drug discovery. Recently, human iPS-derived microglia (iMGLs) models have started to become available. Therefore, the overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize an in vitro high throughput, high content functional suite of AD iMGLs assays with the Phenovista’s proprietary culture screening system. These assays will allow for a next-generation in vitro system for ranking the relative efficacy of AD microglial based therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is among the disorders that represents an underserved area for drug discovery and development. As a result, the successful development of a low-cost, high-performance technology for predicting the efficacy of drugs on human microglia, an important immune cell type in the brain, would help improve the development process for new AD therapies. Therefore, the goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize an in vitro high throughput human microglial assay suite using Phenovista’s proprietary culture screening system.",Microglia models for Alzheimer's disease drug screening,10156247,R43AG071341,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antibodies', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clear Cell', 'Client', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Extracellular Space', 'Fingerprint', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'In Vitro', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-4', 'Knock-out', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory Loss', 'Microglia', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'System', 'TNFSF5 gene', 'TREM2 gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inflammatory milieu', 'macrophage', 'migration', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mutant', 'neuroinflammation', 'next generation', 'pathogen', 'screening', 'synaptic pruning', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'underserved area', 'uptake']",NIA,"PHENOVISTA BIOSCIENCES, LLC",R43,2021,249900
"Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias ABSTRACT Our healthcare system faces larger numbers of individuals with early to late Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders requiring anesthesia associated procedures for serious health related conditions (e.g., cardiac), screening (e.g., colonoscopy), or quality of life improvement (e.g., joint replacement). Despite evidence that preoperative cognitive status is a risk factor for negative post-operative outcomes, there is a scarcity of research addressing perioperative cognitive-biomarker-anesthesia interactions, and evidence based anesthesia-surgical practices for patients with prodromal or diagnosed dementias. The K07 applicant- an NIH funded independent investigator and board certified neuropsychologist with expertise in the cognitive sequelae and associated neuroimaging markers of AD, vascular dementia, and other neurodegenerative disorders, and cognitive and neuroimaging predictors of perioperative cognitive complications and delirium. The applicant (with support of the institution) is proposing a Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for AD and related dementia. The purpose– to promote institutional and community awareness of cognition and memory in older adults electing surgical procedures with anesthesia, intensify collaborations on AD biomarkers- anesthesia interactions, and promote translation of research findings to clinical care. The applicant will complete advanced leadership training and three programmatic aims. Aim 1- convene a multidisciplinary advisory team to establish four integrated PeCAN research cores targeting AD and related dementia perioperative research. Cores include a Cognitive-Clinical Core, a Neuroimaging Core, a Biomarker Core, and a Data Science Core. Aim 2- enhance defined and supportive pathways to the PeCAN cores so that early stage investigators can efficiently initiate and complete perioperative-neurodegenerative research. The applicant will integrate pathways between multiple institutional resources including NIH funded 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute, the University of Florida (UF) Institute on Aging Pepper Center, and the UF Fixel Center for Neurological Diseases. Aim 3- promote the emergence of highly trained scientists and educators for innovative team science addressing perioperative neuronal risk and mechanisms for protection. Methods will involve implementation of a certificate program, interdisciplinary team-science research opportunities, and pilot funding supported through this grant and institutional matching funds. Trainees will initially include appropriate predoctoral T32 trainees, neuropsychology fellows, and anesthesiology fellows. Milestones- annual analyses of programmatic strengths/weaknesses, multidisciplinary proposal submissions, and evidence of trainee success with perioperative research for AD and related dementias.  Narrative Despite expected exponential increases in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and an overabundance of research indicating that preoperative cognitive impairment is a major risk factor for negative post-operative outcome, we know very little of AD cognitive, biomarker, and anesthesia/surgical interactions and have little to no evidence-based perioperative medical care strategies for AD patients. Via the K07 mechanism and institutional support, the applicant will leverage novel perioperative clinical and state-of-the-art institutional facilities to develop an institutional wide research and training program addressing these problems. The proposed program will result in improved awareness of cognition and memory status in older adults prior to surgical procedures with anesthesia, intensify collaborative research addressing brain-behavior-anesthesia interactions through both animal and human research approaches, and promote translation of research findings to clinical care.",Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias,10141175,K07AG066813,"['Academic/Teacher Award', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animals', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Capsicum', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Delirium', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Face', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pecans', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Ventricular', 'White Matter Disease', 'brain behavior', 'brain health', 'certificate program', 'clinical care', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'curriculum development', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal human study', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'older patient', 'postoperative delirium', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'symposium', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K07,2021,162000
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",10248297,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2021,121999
"Beta-Amyloid Clearance Mapping in Alzheimer’s Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that can be characterized by brain imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). MRI explains the structural changes, while PET measures represent plaque deposits in the brain according to the disease progression. The plaque deposition reflects early AD pathophysiology and presumably caused by a decrease in the removal rate of beta-amyloid through the cleaning systems of the brain. Recent studies have suggested the potential role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in carrying waste from brain tissue to the cleaning system. However, it is still not well understood how CSF flow in the brain affects waste removal. Therefore, the proposed multidisciplinary research project will involve the collaboration of investigators from diverse and complementary backgrounds (a biomechanical engineer, an MR physicist, a neuroradiologist, and cognitive neuroscientists) to address CSF flow-related AD pathophysiology. To analyze CSF flow in the narrow space between the skull and brain tissue (subarachnoid space [SAS]), we will employ computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling technique and correlate CSF flow with neuroimaging markers measured by MRI and PET. Here, the overarching hypothesis is, “Disturbed CSF flow in the SAS leads to the deposition of Amyloid plaque.” To test the hypothesis, we will take the following two steps: 1) Fifty healthy older adults will be recruited for an MRI scan. Based on anatomical and CSF velocity information measured by MRI, three-dimensional flow dynamic properties in SAS will be analyzed through CFD simulation, 2) The simulated CSF properties will be correlated with local amyloid plaque deposition by taking advantage of PET imaging data from the NIH-funded parent study (Wake Forest Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center). Here, we will propose a new imaging marker for amyloid removal for each functional brain region by combining imaging, CFD, and clinical measures. As an alternative approach, in case the new imaging markers are not useful in healthy older adults due to the small sample size, we will apply the CFD model to larger datasets for early AD adults. At the completion of this project, a new imaging tool to quantify CSF flow in the SAS and evaluate its effects on amyloid deposition and removal will be proposed. AD pathophysiology at an early stage in older adults can be analyzed using the proposed approach. Ultimately, this project will provide a biomechanical framework for the design and test of interventional and surgical procedures for the treatment of AD. The developed software programs and imaging protocols will be shared through a public software development/sharing platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which involves structural changes as well as plaque deposits in the brain. In this research, we will develop a novel way to analyze the risk of plaque deposition and test its clinical utility. Our research will provide additional scientific insights into AD pathophysiology and improve the diagnosis of neurological diseases at an earlier stage and their monitoring over time.",Beta-Amyloid Clearance Mapping in Alzheimer’s Disease,10196303,R21AG072097,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abeta clearance', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anatomy', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animals', 'Applications Grants', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Equation', 'Excision', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging', 'Fissural', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meningeal lymphatic system', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Pontine structure', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Senile Plaques', 'Structure', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Subarachnoid Space', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Velocimetries', 'abeta accumulation', 'aging brain', 'arachnoid villi', 'base', 'biomechanical engineering', 'brain parenchyma', 'brain tissue', 'cerebrospinal fluid flow', 'cisterna magna', 'clinical center', 'cohort', 'cranium', 'design', 'forest', 'glymphatic system', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'lateral ventricle', 'lymphatic vessel', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'population based', 'pressure', 'programs', 'recruit', 'segmentation algorithm', 'serial imaging', 'sharing platform', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tau Proteins', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,426250
"Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is responsive to NIH solicitation PA-17-089 for projects involving secondary analysis of pre-existing geriatric datasets. While presently there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, existing literature indicates that early diagnosis in the preclinical stage, i.e., before the onset of clinical symptoms, will be key to treatments. There is a pressing need for noninvasive predictors of cognitive decline that can enable early identification of individuals at Alzheimer’s disease risk. A mounting body of scientific evidence suggests that sleep disturbances (including microarchitectural disruptions to non-rapid-eye-motion sleep and decline in sleep quality) might be the earliest observable symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. On-the-go sleep and activity monitoring could address the need for noninvasive indicators of cognitive decline in subjects who are in the (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we will build on preliminary results that reveal a set of sleep features derived from polysomnography (PSG) that are predictive of cognitive performance. We are proposing to perform secondary analysis of sleep and cognition data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort using state-of-the-art deep learning tools to enable sleep-based prediction of cognitive impairment for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. While PSG is the gold standard for sleep measurement, it is not well- suited for routine, day-to-day use. In comparison, wrist-based measurements (e.g. actigraphy, heart rate, ECG, and pulse oximetry) obtained from wearable devices allow “on-the-go” sleep monitoring. The combination of these on-the-go measures with the latest artificial intelligence tools is a feasible route to early Alzheimer’s diagnostics. We will use attention-guided long short-term memory autoencoders to identify overt and latent characteristics of the raw time-series datasets, which will allow us to more effectively mine the rich MESA data resource. Our deep learning framework will also take into account sociodemographic variables, indicators of health status, and medications. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the MESA-trained deep learning models will be performed on PSG and actigraphy data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, which is a longitudinal study designed to further our understanding of what differentiates normal aging from preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To address any concern about the “black-box” nature of deep learning models, we will compare the learned feature set with sleep microarchitectural features previously computed using classical statistical techniques. Previous data suggests that a subject’s apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoE4) allele carrier status influences the degree to which their sleep patterns impact their cognitive abilities. We will verify this by incorporating ApoE4 status as an additional input to the deep learning model. Literature shows that over 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease have at least one clinical sleep disorder. The on-the-go prediction paradigm using noninvasive sleep measurements to be validated in this project will have a significant impact on early Alzheimer’s diagnostics and facilitate ongoing clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep disturbances are a common feature of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease before the onset of symptoms would be critically important for disease management and therapeutics. In this R21 Exploratory Analyses Grant, we propose to develop and validate state-of-the-art deep learning tools to discover novel sleep-based predictors for Alzheimer’s disease through secondary analysis of sleep, activity, and cognitive data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort of human subjects.",Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics,10221599,R21AG068890,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Polysomnography', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research Design', 'Route', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging brain', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'carrier status', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'long short term memory', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'sociodemographic variables', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R21,2021,217797
"Fine-Grained Spatial Information Extraction For Radiology Reports ABSTRACT Automated medical image classification has seen enormous performance improvements recently, particularly in radiology. The application of these approaches to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), however, has been limited due to relatively small datasets and the limited granularity of their corresponding phenotypes. The dataset size issue is problematic as the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved such remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. Furthermore, the phenotype granularity issue impedes the targeted studying of AD along the lines of what is seen in the “precision medicine” approaches to diseases such as cancer. Solutions exist, however, as an increasingly accepted means of acquiring large amounts of labeled data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image If a radiology report describes a patient's AD-related finding, the associated image(s) can be used to train an image classifier. The parent project to this supplemental proposal (R21EB029575) proposes just such a NLP method while simultaneously solving the granularity issue by extracting fine-grained spatial information from the report. In the parent project, we are developing NLP resources and methods to improve the automated labeling of radiology images using the corresponding study reports. The parent is not specific to AD (or any disease), so this supplement will enable us to focus on this particularly important disease, which will benefit significantly from improved ML-based imaging. We will focus on MRI and PET scans. The Aims here parallel the parent project, each focusing on methods that specifically improve NLP for AD radiological indicator extraction as well as the validation of image classification from the corresponding labels. These Aims include (1) extending the spatial representation and corpus for Alzheimer's, (2) extending the NLP methods for automatic extraction, and (3) validating the AD-related labels for use in image classification. The long-term impact of this project is to substantially improve AD diagnosis by scaling up the amount of labeled data available to ML-based classifiers. The short-term goal supplement is to focus our NLP/Imaging combination research on the complex task of improving AD diagnosis. By extending our project with a specific target for AD, we will initiate a sizable research effort toward this goal. NARRATIVE This project proposes natural language processing methods for automatically extracting fine-grained spatial information—specifically related to Alzheimer's disease—from radiology reports. This will allow us to automatically annotate the image(s) associated with the report for scaling up the amount of training data available to enable state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods to better detect Alzheimer's.",Fine-Grained Spatial Information Extraction For Radiology Reports,10288320,R21EB029575,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Text', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'parent project', 'precision medicine', 'radiological imaging', 'risk prediction', 'scale up', 'spatial relationship']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,269607
"Alzheimer's Clinical Trial InnOvatioN (ACTION) Initiative Abstract The National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Research Implementation Milestones articulate the goals of the Institute for advancing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. The Leadership Award for AD and Related Disorders requires that the applicant address objectives of the Milestones and provide mentorship to new and early stage investigators. The research proposed must be groundbreaking and paradigm changing. Among the eight focus areas within the Implementation Milestones' framework are Trial Innovation and Translation and Clinical Research – Pharmacological. The Alzheimer's Clinical Trial InnOvationN (ACTION) Initiative proposed here embraces both the research and mentoring aspects of the Leadership Award. The ACTION Initiative will include development of a Clinical Trials Observatory (CTO) and an embedded mentorship program. The CTO builds on the principal investigator's prior analyses of clinicaltrials.gov. This federal registry contains all trials conducted in the US and many trials conducted ex-US. It includes Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials of preclinical, prodromal, and AD dementia trials. The PI has conducted and published research on the trial design, biomarker, and clinical outcomes data from the registry. In 2016, Congress passed a law requiring that trial outcomes be posted on the site within 1 year of completion of the trial. The PI proposes to build a multi-disciplinary team of engineers, computer scientists, statisticians, and bioinformatic experts to interrogate the range of data now available using artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning and deep learning. An external advisory committee will ensure quality and dissemination. The Alzheimer's Association will collaborate on results dissemination. An accessible web portal for the database will make reviewed data readily available for analyses and prediction/modeling of planned clinical trials. The growing database of real-world AD trial data will allow increasingly precise prediction of trial outcomes based on complex relationships among baseline features, trajectories of decline, drug mechanisms, and clinical and biomarker characteristics across all stages of AD. The data will be used by the PI, mentees, academic trial leaders, and industry trial sponsors. Three initial mentees are identified from neuropsychology, psychiatry, and engineering; more will be added with growth of the program. The ACTION Initiative has the potential to transform clinical trial planning and outcomes, leading to substantial impact on the Implementation Milestones of the NIA and accelerating development of new therapies for patients with AD and those at risk. Mentees will power the future of AD drug development and clinical trial planning. Project Narrative The ACTION Initiative will develop a Clinical Trial Observatory (CTO) with an embedded mentorship program to address the NIA Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Research Implementation Milestones. The CTO will use artificial intelligence with machine learning and trial statistics to interrogate Alzheimer's clinical trial data from the comprehensive federal trial registry, clinicaltrials.gov.

"Identification of Mild Cognitive Impairment using Machine Learning from Language and Behavior Markers Project Summary Recent estimates indicate that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may rank as the third leading cause of death for older people in the United States, just behind heart disease and cancer. While scientists know that AD involves a progressive brain cell failure, the reason why cells fail is still not clear. To understand the progression of the disease, one of the keys is to investigate the cognitive changes in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Even though biomarkers such as imaging and clinical functions are found to be outstanding in differentiating AD patients from those with normal cognition (NC), studies suggest that their discriminative power in early-stage MCI are rather limited. Detecting signals which distinguish subjects with MCI from those with NC is challenging due to the low sensitivity and high variability of current clinical measures such as annually assessed neuropsychological test results and self-reported functional measurements. Moreover, even though in-vivo biomarkers such as beta-amyloid and tau can be used as indicators of pathological progression towards AD, the screening of biomarkers are prohibitively expensive to be widely used among pre-symptomatic individuals in the outpatient setting. We hypothesize that progressive cognitive impact from MCI has elicited detectable changes in the way people talk and behave, which can be sensed by inexpensive and accessible sensors and leveraged by machine learning (ML) algorithms to build predictive models for quantifying the risk of MCI. Our preliminary results on a small cohort indicated that there are significant differences between MCI and NC subjects during a semi-structured conversation, and ML algorithms can use such differences for differentiating MCI and NC with promising performance. Our preliminary results in behavior monitoring also suggest highly predictive performance using temporal patterns of behavior signals. In this project, we plan to build upon our initial success and conduct comprehensive studies on language and behavior markers in larger-scale cohorts to build high-performance and interpretable ML models for screening MCI. Our three Specific Aims are: (1) Discover language markers and develop predictive models characterizing MCI. Using interview recordings from the I-CONECT project, we will use natural language processing and ML algorithms to extract linguistic and acoustic markers and develop multi- modal learning algorithms to fuse the two types of information. (2) Discover behavior markers and develop predictive models characterizing MCI. Using the in-home monitoring data from ORCATECH, we will extract short-term and long-term behavior patterns and integrate multi-granularity behavior markers to differentiate MCI and NC. (3) Linking language and behavior markers with an information framework. We will use demographics and common clinical information to profile the patients and match the two cohorts via certain similarity metrics, creating complementary features for improved prediction.

"Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While important progress has been achieved in our understanding of the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics, as well as genomic and neurobiological substrates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, identifying individuals at a preclinical stage remains a vital priority and substantial challenge. The early and accurate identification of at-risk individuals becomes particularly important as we embark on next- generation randomized clinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of AD. The NIA recently convened a workshop involving experts from academia, nonprofit organizations, and industry with the goal to consider cost- effective strategies to improve the early detection of cognitive decline. A key recommendation by workshop participants emphasized opportunities to leverage existing longitudinal studies and apply machine learning techniques as a cost-effective approach to detect early cognitive decline. The current proposal represents a targeted step toward achieving those recommendations by leveraging a large and ongoing longitudinal study of APOE genotype and cognition (led by Dr. Richard Caselli at Mayo Clinic Arizona), and applies machine learning to identify individuals at risk for incident MCI at the earliest possible detectable stage. Machine-learning (ML) techniques implement predictive algorithms to find optimal mathematical and computational solutions to a set of complex problems. In dementia research, ML and pattern detection algorithms have been applied mainly to neuroimaging data, or neuroimaging data combined with clinical and genetic data, to distinguish prevalent MCI or AD cases from healthy controls. However, it remains to be determined whether ML algorithms can be marshalled as a key strategic and predictive approach to identify cognitively normal individuals at the earliest detectable stage of incipient decline. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposal aims to: (1) Investigate whether subtle variations among standard clinical and cognitive measures at baseline are associated with subsequent decline and incident MCI. Methods to achieve this aim consist of an ensemble ML approach, anchored by a random forests learning algorithm, applied to baseline demographic, clinical, and cognitive data as well as APOE genotype in a cohort of 784 adults. (2) Develop a probabilistic algorithm that predicts out-of-sample incident MCI cases. This aim will be accomplished by selecting 80% of the longitudinal data as an in-sample subset and using a dynamic Bayesian network approach to model the probabilistic trajectories of diagnosis at each study visit. With this Bayesian model, it will be possible to develop an algorithm to estimate each person’s unique risk of future MCI diagnosis. (3) Validate the predictive diagnostic algorithm using the remaining 20% of longitudinal data (out-of- sample subset), plus data from additional accruals during the intervening period. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health by helping to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE As our scientific field embarks on next-generation preclinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, it become critically important to identify accurately who amongst cognitively healthy adults is at an increased risk of cognitive decline and development of dementia. Consistent with the recommendations from the NIA to find cost-effective solutions that capitalize on existing data and apply new methods from artificial intelligence, the current proposal aims to apply machine learning techniques to identify, at the earliest possible detectable stage, those individuals who are at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health as it may help to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions.",Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures,10108473,R03AG070486,"['21 year old', 'Academia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arizona', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data de-identification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'response']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R03,2021,157708
"GaitIQ: Establishing a Digital Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Early detection of pre-clinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) during the long latent period prior to manifest dementia offers significant opportunities to advance the development of disease modifying interventions and effectively slow the disease’s progression. To achieve this objective, there is a critical need for new technologies that accelerate the development of biomarkers with high sensitivity for underlying AD pathology. A highly promising biomarker for preclinical AD is gait, as subtle gait changes have been correlated with elevated amyloid burden and cortical atrophy. While even simple measures of gait speed predict incident dementia in older adults, current research indicates that preclinical AD pathology is more precisely captured by a combination of 3D kinematic and spatio-temporal measures. A cost-effective mobile application that can be used in clinical trials and by healthcare personnel to capture these parameters efficiently, combined with a validated system to translate the measures to quantifiable AD risk in minutes, would result in a paradigm shift in availability of AD screening for at-risk individuals. GaitIQ™ is an innovative digital health startup company developing an online software-based product that employs computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) to compute clinically accurate spatio-temporal and 3D kinematic data, from a simple video of a person walking. GaitIQTM collaborates with The Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio and Southwest Research Institute for this SBIR project. The expected outcome is that advanced kinematic/spatio-temporal measures of gait captured by the GaitIQTM system will reveal a sensitive and specific gait signature with high diagnostic accuracy for pre-clinical AD in a sample of Hispanic older adults. The project will develop and validate the capacity of GaitIQ™ to detect a digital gait biomarker signature that distinguishes between individuals with preclinical AD and controls. The final digital platform will be an easy-to-use, powerful tool to identify and monitor patients with pre-clinical AD using just an iPad/tablet to video their gait and submit it for analysis in the cloud by GaitIQTM sophisticated, proprietary analysis software. Changes in a patient’s walking gait can reveal important early signs of AD decades before cognitive symptoms are observed. GaitIQ™ is a San Antonio-based startup company focused on developing an early-stage digital health software technology that leverages novel machine vision, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics.

"Genetics of deep-learning-derived neuroimaging endophenotypes for Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive impairment of cognitive and memory functions and is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. It affects 5.6 million Americans over the age of 65 and exacts tremendous and increasing demands on patients, caregivers, and healthcare resources, making this condition among the most significant public health problems of our time. Despite extensive studies, our understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of AD is still limited, hindering advances in the development of therapeutic and preventive strategies. Genetic studies of AD have successfully identified 40 novel loci but these explain only a fraction of the overall disease risk, suggesting opportunities for additional discoveries. Advanced neuroimaging is an essential part of current AD clinical and research investigations, which generally focus on relatively few imaging phenotypes developed by neuro- radiologists. However, there is a growing interest in exploiting the high-content information in large-scale, high dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to identify novel AD biomarkers. Deep learning (DL) methods, an emerging area of machine learning research, uses raw images to derive optimal vector representations of imaging contents, which can be used as informative AD endophenotypes. To overcome the low interpretability traditionally attributed to DL, whole genome sequence data provide an opportunity to identify novel genes underlying the DL- derived imaging endophenotypes and test their association with AD and AD-related traits in large cohort samples. The proposed project will leverage existing neuroimaging and genetic data resources from the UK Biobank, the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, and will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team of investigators. We will derive AD endophenotypes from neuroimaging data in the UK Biobank using deep learning (DL). We will identify novel genetic loci associated with DL-derived imaging endophenotypes and optimize the co-heritability of these endophenotypes with AD-related phenotypes using UK Biobank genetic data. We will leverage resources and collaborations with AD Consortia and the power of DL-derived neuroimaging endophenotypes to identify novel genes for Alzheimer's Disease and AD-related traits. Also, we will develop DL-based neuroimaging harmonization and imputation methods and distribute implementation software to the research community. We expect to discover new genes relevant to AD which may leads to understanding of molecular basis of AD and potential new treatment. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is sever neurodegenerative disease affecting aging Americans and exacts tremendous and increasing demands on patients, caregivers, and healthcare resources.

"Fast and robust deep learning tools for analysis of neuroimaging data of Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Interventions at the preclinical and prodromal stages are appealing targets for slowing or halting disease progression. It is desired to achieve accurate prognosis of AD dementia and cognitive decline for people with mild cognitive impairment who have increased risk to develop AD. In order to achieve fast and accurate prognosis of AD dementia based on neuroimaging data, we will develop and validate novel deep learning techniques. Particularly, we will develop unsupervised deep learning methods for segmenting brain images and reconstructing cortical surfaces from structural magnetic resonance imaging data. These fast and accurate image processing methods will be used in conjunction with advanced deep learning methods to build prognosis models of AD dementia and cognitive decline in a time-to-event analysis framework using large-scale imaging datasets. Finally, we will develop and disseminate a user friendly, open source, modular, and extensible software package to improve prognosis of AD dementia. Source code, standalone programs, and web-application interfaces of all the algorithms will be made available on GitHub and NITRC. Our tools will enable real-time neuroimaging data analysis and can find applications in diverse fields, including quantifying brain changes associated with aging and development.

"Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an urgent national and international research priority. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark of AD. Their building blocks are Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, respectively. At present, we lack an understanding of the set of genes that affect formation of plaques and tangles along with protective and pathological responses to these toxic peptides. Biologists are now gathering gene expression data and Aβ and tau measures from human brain tissues. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (here, gene expression levels) that best predict an outcome (Aβ or tau level). The identified features, biomarkers, can help determine the molecular basis for plaques and tangles. Unfortunately, false positive biomarkers are very common, as evidenced by low success rates of replication in independent data and low success reaching clinical practice (less than 1%). We seek to radically shift the current paradigm in biomarker discovery by resolving three fundamental problems with the current approach using novel, theoretically well-founded machine learning (ML) methods to learn interpretable models from data. Aim 1. Learn an interpretable feature representation from publicly available, high-throughput brain data. High-dimensionality, hidden variables, and complex feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., observed statistical associations) and true biological interactions. To increase the chance to identify true positive biomarkers, we need new feature selection criteria to learn a model that better explains rather than simply predicts the outcome. To do so, our proposed ML algorithms will identify the genes that are likely to give a meaningful explanation of the outcome (Aβ or tau level) by inferring both the functions of genes in the cellular processes contributing to AD and the gene interaction network from many existing brain datasets. Aim 2. Make interpretable predictions using a unified framework to explain model predictions. Due to disease heterogeneity, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) often more accurately describe relationships between genes and an outcome than simpler, linear models, but lack interpretability. We will develop a novel ML framework that interprets complex model predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a specific prediction, which will identify features of high importance for each individual as personalized markers and classify subjects based on these importance estimates. Aim 3. Validate the identified candidate biomarkers using powerful worm models of AD. Analyzing observational data without doing interventional experiments cannot prove causal relationships. In collaboration with co-I Matt Kaeberlein, we will utilize powerful nematode models of AD to test our hypotheses on the role of certain genes as disease modifiers, and develop a new way to refine the models based on this knowledge. Successful completion of this project will result in previously unknown molecular basis for Aβ and tau levels, potential therapeutic targets, and general ML techniques widely applicable to many other data science problems. Project Narrative In the United States alone, someone receives an Alzheimer’s diagnosis every 66 seconds, and the disease has become the 6th leading cause of death in this country; Alzheimer’s disease (AD) currently has no cure, no prevention, and no treatment to reverse or halt its deadly progression. The recent, rapid growth of gene expression data from human brain tissues hold great promise for identifying therapeutic targets, but extremely low success rates to identify true positive biomarkers indicate fundamental problems with the current computational approach being used. We seek to revolutionize the way we identify drug targets by developing novel machine learning techniques that extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data, combined with biological validation in an animal model of AD.",Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets,10132962,R01AG061132,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'Network-based', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Oral', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'RNA Interference', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Selection Criteria', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain tissue', 'candidate marker', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'direct application', 'disease heterogeneity', 'drug response prediction', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'proteostasis', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,582016
"Digital Biomarkers for Alzheimers Disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by progressive neuropathological changes that begin decades before cognitive and functional symptoms, and thus efforts have been focused on developing innovative tools and biomarkers for early identification of pre-dementia stages. To date, clinical ability to identify those with pre-dementia stages of AD has been limited and requires expensive (Amyloid PET) or invasive (Lumbar Punctures, LP) testing. However, subtle changes in connected speech may be detectable years before overt disease symptoms present. Our team has developed an approach that uses machine learning and natural language processing combined with advanced acoustic phonetic and lexical-semantic analyses. Preliminary data show promise in identifying AD biomarker status and predicting 2-year cognitive progression. In the proposed study, we leverage our success in collecting CSF biomarkers, neuroimaging and detailed cognitive phenotyping combined with audio-recordings of participants in the Brain Stress, Hypertension and Aging Research Program cohort. This cohort, now in its second year of follow-up, consists of 400 individuals 50 years or older with normal cognition or MCI. We plan to extend this cohort of 400 participants for 3 more years to collect additional waves of voice recordings, cognitive assessments, and follow-up CSF biomarkers and neuroimaging. Our overarching hypothesis is that the derived novel features reflecting poor lexical-semantic connectedness or acoustic perturbations are significantly different between biomarker positive and negative participants, have better diagnostic performance than traditional cognitive tests (e.g. confrontation naming), and are associated with a longitudinal change in cognition and AD-related biomarkers. The Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the accuracy of the derived digital biomarkers in detection of in-vivo AD pathology in the B-SHARP cohort; 2) Investigate longitudinally the association of the derived features with cognitive decline and their ability to reflect changes in AD biomarkers; and 3) using resting state functional MRI, identify the networks in the brain that map to derived lexical semantic and acoustic features with brain connectivity at baseline and during follow-up. This project will provide needed insight into the use of non-invasive digital biomarkers to improve the ability to detect and track longitudinal changes in cognitive and functional status in AD. Recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning offer a unique opportunity to explore highly complex changes in connected speech in the preclinical and prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the accuracy and diagnostic performance of non-invasive digital biomarkers in detecting and predicting AD biomarker status in individuals with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment.

"Machine and deep learning for finding multimodal imaging biomarkers in prodromal AD Our proposed study focuses on developing deep neural networks and sophisticated multivariate analysis methods for studying episodic memory activations in prodromal AD subjects and age-matched normal controls. We are particularly interested in investigating the effects of spatial and object pattern-separation in subfields of the hippocampus, nearby regions of the medial temporal lobe, and functional whole-brain connections. In order to acquire a fuller understanding of the underlying physiological processes driving AD pathology, activations in hippocampal subfields must be investigated in further depth and with methodologies that exceed the current limitations of fMRI at 3T. Acquiring data that will yield a more accurate view of these hippocampal interactions is far more easily facilitated with 7T technology, although barriers complicate such a study even at 7T. Our proposed study centers on circumventing these barriers, particularly data contamination from excessive system noise, head-motion noise, and physiological noise which is proportional to the field strength, to develop methods that will allow investigators to work within the parameters of 7T at its fullest capacity toward the development of more powerful imaging biomarkers for diagnosing AD. To increase the likelihood of the successful completion of our study, we consider it imperative to develop better task fMRI designs and imaging protocols (Aim 1), automatic segmentation methods (Aim 2), noise-reduction methods (Aim 3), and multivariate analysis methods, such as novel algorithms and software tools based on constrained canonical correlation analysis (constrained CCA), kernel CCA, and deep CCA and relevant group-level analysis using fusion CCA, multiset CCA, and machine learning and deep learning techniques (Aim 4) for studying memory function to obtain novel imaging biomarkers (Aim 5) to identify individuals at risk for AD. This study will enable the creation of clearer and more detailed brain activation maps and thus promote the discovery of currently unknown aspects of brain function in prodromal AD. The successful completion of our objectives could lead to more effective diagnostic tools for AD, including an fMRI-based diagnostic test for memory impairment to characterize abnormal memory function in people at risk for AD. Our advanced methodology, combining 7T high-resolution fMRI, automatic segmentation, data denoising and multivariate analysis, will be essential for detecting subtle functional changes in subfields of the hippocampus and its connections to other cortical regions. Results from this study are expected to broadly impact scientific understanding of brain function beyond only enhancing current understanding of memory function in AD. We anticipate that the methods developed from findings acquired in our proposed study will have a far-reaching influence on improving fMRI data quality, enable more accurate detection of brain activation, open a path toward better automated and instantaneous hippocampal subfield segmentation for many other MRI/fMRI applications of neurodegenerative diseases, and contribute new and vital discoveries to the field of neuroscience in general. Project narrative The proposed study is highly relevant to public health because advanced mathematical and statistical methods will allow for more in-depth analysis of high-resolution fMRI data, in particular, data used in the characterization of brain function, which offers significant potential for more effective diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study will investigate memory activation in the medial temporal lobes with high-resolution imaging at 7 Tesla with multivariate analysis to identify brain dysfunction in prodromal AD.

"The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents Abstract: Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the US and epidemiological data suggests they are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and have a higher occurrence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). AD is defined neuropathologically by the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques. In addition to these hallmarks, many AD patients have mixed neuropathologies, including Lewy bodies (LBs) and pathological indices of CVD. Studies, involving mainly NHWs, have shown associations of these neuropathologies with clinical, genetic, and demographic variables providing insights into disease mechanisms and prevention strategies. However, there is a relative dearth of neuropathology studies on Hispanics. It is imperative to have neuropathology studies with individuals having diverse characteristics as this maximizes variability allowing for better identification of disease risk factors for more precision in development of preventative measures. This study will examine the neuropathologic landscape (the presence, location, and density of NFTs, plaques, CVD and LBs) of Hispanics compared to NHWs and determine if this landscape is altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables. To achieve efficiencies in time and further measurement precision we will enhance and adapt innovative machine learning algorithms to narrow in on pathology location and provide more quantitative analyses. Based on previous findings our central hypothesis is that Hispanics will have different neuropathologic landscapes when compared to NHWs and these differences are influenced by underlying risk factors, especially cardiovascular risk factors. Our specific aims are to: 1) profile the presence, location, and semi-quantitative densities of NFTs, plaques, LBs, and pathological indices of CVD in the setting of AD in Hispanics compared to NHWs, 2) profile and determine if pathologic measures from Aim 1 are altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables (APOE status, Hispanic origin, age at death, clinical history of cerebrovascular events (i.e. stroke), hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, sex, and/or education) and 3) strengthen and adapt a deep learning pipeline for quantifying AD pathologies. We will capitalize on existing well-characterized resources within three Alzheimer’s disease centers at University of California- Davis, the University of California- San Diego, and Columbia that contain a diverse autopsy confirmed AD Hispanic and NHW cohort. Also, we will use machine learning resources at the University of California San Francisco. This proposal will be the first largescale initiative to delineate the neuropathology in over 100 Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican origins compare to over 200 NHWs and determine the impact of comorbid risk factors. Profiling neuropathologic landscapes and understanding underlying factors has potential to shed light on mechanistic differences in disease development leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. Results will directly advance understanding of brain health (pathology) in an important and growing part of the elderly population that to date there is miniscule neuropathology information.

"Predictive analytics for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is a major global healthcare burden. However, there is still no effective disease modifying therapy for AD and clinical trials with the aim of preventing or stabilizing cognitive impairment have largely failed. Decision making in both clinical practice and research is highly dependent on practical predictive tools, which can effectively predict cognitive or functional outcomes in individuals. Such models could be potentially used in clinical research to boost the power of trials by enrollment of participants who are most likely to show disease progression during the trial’s timeframe. Alternatively, these models could be used to identifying individuals who would benefit from primary or secondary prevention once there are effective treatments for AD. In this project, we aim to provide a framework for practical prediction of cognitive decline with aging and prodromal AD, by applying a novel ML framework to multiple dimensions of data (demographics, genetic risk scores, neuropsychological measures, structural MRI, and amyloid imaging). Our ultimate goal is to arrive at a new “Machine Learning predictive framework for aging and AD” (ML4AD), comprised of dimensions each of which each will add incremental value to the predictive models, hence increasing the performance of predictive models while keeping the costs and burden of research at a minimum. The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23), Dr. Ali Ezzati, is a Neurologist whose career goal is to develop predictive tools to help research and clinical decision making in cognitive aging and dementia. The proposed research will leverage the rich clinical and biomarker dataset available from several ongoing international studies, but will also provide a unique avenue of investigation for the candidate. The candidate's career development will benefit from close mentorship and scientific guidance of outstanding investigators in aging/AD neurobiology (Dr. Lipton), machine learning and computational neuroscience (Dr. Davatzikos), and biostatistics (Dr. Hall). The findings from this study will inform future secondary prevention trials, in which sensitive indicators of early AD will be necessary to identify high-risk subjects and track early clinical decline. This work will serve as the foundation to move forward in independent research focusing on development of predictive tools in AD and related neurodegenerative disorders.

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia",10188360,R01AG053949,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Bayesian learning', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Harvest', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevention approach', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Saliva', 'Scanning', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'case control', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'genetic testing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk minimization', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'software development', 'sound', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIA,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,410000
"Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease This research project tackles the NIH/NIA grand challenge of using a person's own vehicle as a passive-detection system for flagging potential age- and disease-related aberrant driving that may signal early warning signs of functional decline or incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early identification and treatment are essential steps to mitigating the growing costs and burden of AD. Our foundational advancements in quantifying driver behavior from in-vehicle systems (""Black Boxes"") and wearable sensors, and strategic analytic methods and pipelines using statistical and machine learning approaches, are directly relevant to meeting this NIH/NIA challenge. The proposal builds strategically on current project discoveries and successes that comprehensively characterized patterns of real-world driving exposure and risk in 136 older drivers across 500,000 miles driven. Under the proposal's conceptual framework, functional abilities determine specific driver behavior patterns and errors. Behaviors, in tum, index driver functional abilities and clinical features of NIA-Alzheimer's Association (AA) core clinical criteria of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (operationalized by Alzheimer's clinical syndrome [ACS]). Sleep and mobility play roles as key mediators of relationships between driver behavior and functional impairment. Accordingly, our Specific Aims (SA) are: SA1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a continuous, 3-month, baseline period that classify normally aging, MCI, and ACS drivers by NIA-AA core clinical criteria. SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility factors, collected over a continuous, 3-month baseline period, mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features (SA1). SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (SA 1) and real-world sleep and mobility (SA2) to detect clinical feature severity of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. To address these aims, our team of experts-in medicine, AD, driving in aging and disease, cognitive neuroscience, transportation engineering, machine learning, computer vision, and longitudinal biostatistics--will apply our approach to drivers with a broader range of impairments across the aging to AD spectrum. A total of 180 drivers, ages 65- 90 years, who have ACS (N=40), MCI (N=80), or are normally aging (N=60) based on NIA-AA clinical criteria will be studied across a 3-month baseline period of real-world naturalistic driver behavior, sleep, and mobility monitoring. Two longitudinal assessments, each 1 year apart, will comprehensively assess each driver's risk for and severity of functional decline. By extracting ""digital fingerprints"" of aberrant driver behavior in drivers al risk for AD, this project complements seismic advances in biologic diagnosis of preclinical AD and advances NIH priorities lo improve older driver safely, mobility, quality of life, with unprecedented access lo diagnostic care. Passive monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status in individuals at risk for AD directly promotes interventions aimed at early treatment of and preventing progression of AD in its preclinical stages. The goal of this research project is to address the NIH and NIA's grand challenge of using a person's own vehicle as a passive-detection system for flagging potential age- and/or disease-related aberrant driving behaviors that may signal early warning signs of functional decline of Alzheimer's disease (AD), even before standard clinical tests do so. Our Specific Aims will assess and combine key factors affecting driver behavior and clinical status in aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS) as markers and moderators of risk: SA 1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a 3-month continuous, baseline period that classify NIA-AA core clinical criteria of MCI and ACS in drivers who are normally aging (N = 60), MCI (N = 80), or ACS (N = 40); SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features; SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (from SA 1) and driver sleep and mobility (from SA2) to detect early signs of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. By building on our extensive successes in the current phase, the project directly advances NIH and NIA goals lo detect early warnings signs of decline and incipient AD-with the goal of screening, identifying, and tracking individuals at risk for AD from passive-monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status and progression-promoting early treatment of AD and the next stage of interventions to prevent the progression of AD even in its preclinical stages.",Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease,10161702,R01AG017177,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weather', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cost', 'detection platform', 'digital', 'driving behavior', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'older driver', 'older patient', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'rural setting', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'urban setting', 'visual motor', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,1039678
"Deep Learning with Neuroimaging Genetic Data for Alzheimer's Disease Summary  Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects over 44 million individuals worldwide, and the number is projected to triple by 2050. However, currently there is no cure for AD. This project aims to develop and apply novel statistical methods, especially deep learning, to advance neuroimaging genetics for AD. It involves novel methodological developments in Aims 1-4, cost-effective applications to the large-scale UK Biobank neuroimaging genetic data for AD (Aim 5), and software development (Aim 6). All four Aims for the methods development tackle emerging impor- tant topics in deep learning with their applications to neuroimaging genetics for AD; although the other three Aims deal with independent topics with their own other broad applications, they in turn serve for Aim 1: 1) Aim 1 applies manually searched deep learning models for automatic feature extraction/phenotyping from neuroimages, by which both the statistical power and biological interpretation of subsequent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are expected to be enhanced; 2) Aim 2 employs (automatic) neural architecture search (NAS) to more efﬁciently identify better deep learning models, which are then applied to Aim 1 for enhancing feature extraction/phenotyping and thus boosting the power of GWAS; 3) Aim 3 focuses on explainable deep learning, offering biological insights by localizing and highlighting the most important features extracted by deep learning models that can be used for Aim 1; 4) Aim 4 develops a novel inferential theory for deep learning, which is then applied to rigorously test for the statistical signiﬁcance of any selected/highlighted features used in Aim 1. In Aim 5, these new methods will be applied to the UK Biobank neuroimaging and GWAS data to identify novel genetic loci and neuroimaging features for AD. As a byproduct, we will develop and distribute software implementing the proposed methods in Aim 6.

"Translational big data analytic approaches to advance drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major public health crisis with no available cure. Given recent failures of many AD clinical trials, there is an urgent need for developing effective strategies to identify new AD targets for disease modeling and new candidates for drug repurposing and development. We propose here a research project to develop transformative big data analytic approaches in the fields of translational bioinformatics, machine learning and deep learning to advance drug repurposing for AD. Our overarching goal is to develop innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches as well as informatics tools and pipelines that leverage big data in relevant biomedical domains. These big data include large-scale genetic, multi-omics, imaging, cognitive and other phenotypic data from landmark AD studies, functional interaction data among drugs, proteins and diseases, pharmacologic perturbation data, electronic health record data, and MarketScan data. Our proposed computational research is aimed at developing novel translational informatics approaches to analyze various types of molecular, clinical and other relevant data to identify individual drugs or drug combinations with favorable efficacy and toxicity profiles as candidates for repositioning against AD or AD- related dementia (ADRD). To achieve our goal, we have four Aims. Aim 1 is to develop network-based multi- omics data integration methods to identify genes and pathways as novel targets for AD drug repositioning research. Aim 2 is to develop informatics strategies to prioritize and evaluate promising candidate targets via examining their associations with AD biomarkers and phenotypes. Aim 3 is to develop knowledge-driven drug repurposing methods using network reinforcement and drug scoring to identify AD candidate drugs. Aim 4 is to prioritize and evaluate the identified candidate drugs for repurposing against AD/ADRD using pharmacologic perturbation, EHR and MarketScan data. Successful completion of these aims will produce novel translational big data analytic methods and tools to improve our understanding of the genetic, molecular and neurobiological mechanisms of AD, facilitate the identification of novel promising targets and drugs for repurposing, and ultimately have a translational impact on disease treatment and prevention. These advances are fundamental to the NIA NAPA goal of effectively treating or preventing AD/ADRD by 2025. The resulting methods and tools are also expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes.

"Machine learning for brain and epigenetic aging in neurodegenerative diseases Project Summary/Abstract Accurate quantiﬁcation of aging for different organ systems enables detection of any deviation from typical aging and identiﬁcation of early onset of a disease characterized by accelerated aging, and thus provides opportunities for early intervention. The brain-Predicted Age Difference (brainPAD) is a new clinical informatics framework deﬁned as the difference between the brain-derived age and the chronological age of the individual. It has been suggested that brainPAD correlates with physical ﬁtness, cognitive performance, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, several limitations remain in current brainPAD models. Models with large age range yield prediction error larger than 5 years and are often derived from a single-modal imaging feature set (e.g. only structural data). Moreover, due to known inﬂuence of sex differences on brain morphology, existing models are trained on male and female separately, which may pose challenges in studies with small sample size and in interpretation across models. Finally, because of the phenomenon of regression to the mean, predicted age is overestimated in younger individuals and underestimated in older, which can lead to false positive associations of brainPAD with variables of interest, such as disease status.  To address these limitations, this proposal aims to develop and apply novel machine learning algorithms and biomedical software to increase the model accuracy and robustness in three Speciﬁc Aims: 1) Develop and evaluate a novel feature selection method to identify brain features inﬂuencing brainPAD; 2) Apply the novel machine learning framework to explore different data types and feature types provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); 3) Develop and validate integrative methods to create new measures of clinically abnormal aging and compute these measures on the ADNI longitudinal data.

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate multi-modal neuroimaging to quantify the heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects over 5 million Americans posing a significant burden to the community and health care system. Machine learning (ML) methods have been crucial in detecting the disease and characterizing its progression. Due to the lack of an in vivo “ground truth” diagnosis, ML approaches have typically relied on clinically derived labels and a case-control design in their search for a single imaging pattern that optimally distinguishes between the two groups in the case-control design. However, heterogeneity within clinical labels may degrade performance and interpretability. The goal of this project is to address this limitation and accurately characterize heterogeneity in preclinical and symptomatic AD. Given that age is a major risk factor for developing dementia, we will characterize healthy aging using multimodal neuroimaging data and ML in Aim 1. To this end, we propose to develop a novel unsupervised multi-view machine learning tool that can integrate information from multiple imaging modalities (i.e., structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and amyloid and tau sensitive Positron Emission Tomography) in a principled way. This will enable us to define the normal trajectory of age- related changes across all modalities, providing the necessary context to understand AD pathology. We will characterize AD pathology using multimodal neuroimaging data and ML in Aim 2. To this end, we propose to develop a novel semi-supervised ML framework that integrates multimodal information and derives data-driven disease dimensions. This is achieved by identifying and quantifying at the individual level imaging patterns that capture neuroanatomical and neuropathological alterations. Our approach builds on our extensive prior work on using an advanced, unsupervised multivariate pattern analysis technique, termed orthonormal projective non-negative matrix factorization, for analyzing neuroimaging data. Importantly, our project leverages two large multimodal datasets, the Knight AD Research Center (ADRC) cohort and AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which sample participants across the continuum of AD making them ideal for investigating heterogeneity of AD pathology using advanced ML techniques. If successful, our approaches could be used for studying any brain disorder and could be readily integrated into personalized medicine strategies in the future when rich, multimodal imaging data collection will become a routine diagnostic procedure in hospitals. Project narrative Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects over 5 million Americans posing a significant burden to the community and health care system. Measurements of anatomy derived from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as well as measurements abnormal amyloid and tau protein depositions derived from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are increasingly used in AD research. In this project, we propose to develop advanced machine learning methods that can integrate information from PET and MRI toward characterizing disease heterogeneity in preclinical and symptomatic AD. This can improve our understanding of the underlying biological causes of the disease, leading to improved diagnosis and prognosis as well as therapeutic innovation by enabling patient stratification for clinical trials.",Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate multi-modal neuroimaging to quantify the heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease,10121679,R01AG067103,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Anatomy', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Enabling Factors', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'case control', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'community burden', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder subtype', 'healthy aging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'quantitative imaging', 'supervised learning', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,535629
"Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of dissection photos with 3D scanning Project Summary Title: Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of dissection photos with 3D scanning Summary: While most patients with late life dementia have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there are conditions that overlap or even mimic AD, confounding clinical diagnosis, and thus representing a barrier to accurate predictions of rate of progression and to effective therapeutics. Examples of these diseases include concomitant TDP-43 pathology, Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and microvascular lesions associated with poorly defined white matter lesions. A critical barrier to studying these diseases is that there currently is no reliable premortem biomarker. Here we propose a collaboration with two Alzheimer’s Research Centers to evaluate anatomical signatures of these three conditions, in contrast to AD, in order to enable research into them, and ultimately port back to MRI in order to directly enhance clinical care.  Specifically, we propose to use advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to perform volumetric photographic scanning post mortem (at autopsy), on patients seen at the Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease Research Center (MADRC). Reconstructing imaging volumes from dissection photographs, which are routinely acquired at brain banks and neuropathology departments, will enable us to correlate neuropathology with macroscopic measurements (e.g., volume and shape of brain structures, cortical thickness) without the need for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. This is crucial because diagnostic MRI is not always acquired close to autopsy, or at all, and ex vivo MRI is expensive, technically challenging, and not available at many research sites. Therefore, our technique has the potential of greatly increasing sample sizes, especially with asymptomatic individuals who were not scanned in life, and who would likely manifest the earliest and purest neuropathological changes.  Our tools will combine ML with 3D shape scanning, which is an increasingly inexpensive technology ($1,000 - $10,000 for a scanner), to produce very accurate reconstructions of the brain shape. Moreover, we will also build an “atlas” version of the tool, that replaces 3D scanning by a probabilistic atlas, thus enabling analysis of retrospective data. We will develop the tools in collaboration with a second ADRC, the University of Washington ADRC, which has slice photographs for approximately one thousand cases.  The new tools will be used to closely study a prospective cohort at MADRC, consisting of 200 subjects. We seek to identify neuroimaging signatures of the AD mimics mentioned above, which can be ported to in vivo MRI scanning. Moreover, we will also distribute and maintain the tools as part of our neuroimaging package FreeSurfer (over 40,000 worldwide licenses), so they can be used by research sites around the world to augment neuropathology with macroscopic morphometric measures at little or no cost. Project Narrative There are conditions that overlap or even mimic Alzheimer’s disease, confounding clinical diagnosis, and thus representing a barrier to effective treatment. Here we propose a collaboration with two NIH Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers to build advanced Artificial Intelligence tools that, combined with a 3D shape scanner, convert dissection photographs (routinely acquired by research centers) into 3D datasets. We will use these tools to unravel the connection between brain shape and microscopic diagnosis of AD mimics, and will also distribute them as part of our widespread software package FreeSurfer (over 40,000 worldwide licenses), so they can be freely used by research laboratories around the world.","Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of dissection photos with 3D scanning",10125271,R01AG070988,"['3-Dimensional', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Back', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Photography', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Senile Plaques', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'design', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'heterogenous data', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in-vivo diagnostics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'object shape', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,502096
"Social spatial navigation assessment for early-stage Alzheimer's disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a public health epidemic, laying an enormous mental, physical, and financial burden on individuals, families, and societies. Despite significant research efforts around the world, the specific link between cognitive / functional deficits and the underlying pathology remains unclear. Critical to solving this is the evaluation of novel cognitive tests within cohorts that have detailed biomarkers for AD pathophysiology. Widely used cognitive tests for AD focus on episodic memory deficits, but recent work led by us and others indicates that tests of spatial navigation and orientation may provide significantly more accurate detection of the earliest signatures of AD. Our hypothesis is that integrating tests of navigation and orientation (to people, places, and events) into one test will prove particularly sensitive. Currently no such test exists.  Our aim is to develop and evaluate a novel ecologically valid cognitive test which probes both navigation and orientation in order to assess cognitively normal older adults (CN), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild AD dementia participants from two ongoing imaging studies (R01 AG053184 and R01 AG067021) of the Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Gad Marshall. Participants will undergo amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) as part of those studies, which we will leverage in relating those biomarker findings to our novel cognitive test across the early AD continuum. Creating the new test will require combining the expertise of Co-PI Dr. Hugo Spiers (expert in spatial navigation) and Co-PI Dr. Shahar Arzy (expert in orientation). Dr. Spiers has recently developed a virtual reality (VR)-based assessment tool for smartphone and tablet devices that has tested 4.3 million participants on their navigation ability. While this enables an unparalleled opportunity for machine learning to detect subtle impairments, the task is not tailored to the individual’s personal world, which clinical experience as well as research from the Co-PI, Dr. Arzy, indicate to be critical in AD. We therefore propose to develop a novel patient-tailored digital personalized tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of early- stage AD. Building on our recent work, Google Street View (GSV) images will be used to display and enable navigation of the participant’s familiar environment. Overlaid text messages will pop up to provide information about the overriding cover-story and to test navigation and orientation. We will benchmark how hard each person’s environment is to navigate using reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained on the local street networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to understand the brain networks engaged by the new task and allow a comparison with the pathological and clinical data collected by Dr. Marshall. Machine learning models will be used to detect subtle impairment in the individual participant level. Following Dr. Spiers’ success in mass appeal and the access to advanced machine learning analyses, the project will enable precision personalized diagnostics of people at the earliest symptomatic stages of AD, and later on, a digital tool to conveniently follow patients over time. Project Narrative  The development of a new digital diagnostic test for the assessment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that is ecologically valid is of great importance. In the process, we will gain a new understanding of how people orient and navigate in familiar places and social networks and obtain a more detailed understanding of the changes in the brain that take place in AD in relation to the main problems that occur early in the disease. Finally, new insights into the brain dynamics involved in navigating space and social networks will be gained.",Social spatial navigation assessment for early-stage Alzheimer's disease,10126352,R21AG070877,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory impairment', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neighborhoods', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Space Perception', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'digital', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'personalized diagnostics', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'social', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality', 'way finding', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,190054
"Improving the sensitivity and specificity of MRI-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease Finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one the greatest scientiﬁc challenges of our time. There is a growing realization that experimental treatments should target the earliest, presymptomatic stages of disease. But the cost of conducting clinical trials in participants who may not develop symptoms of AD for years can be prohibitive. There is a growing need for more eﬀective biomarkers of AD, particularly biomarkers of therapeutic eﬃcacy that can detect slowing or reversal of AD-related changes due to treatment as early in the clinical trial as possible. These biomarkers must be as sensitive as possible to disease progression and also account for AD heterogeneity, i.e., the fact that the majority of individuals who have AD pathology also have one or more concomitant pathologies that may aﬀect their ability to respond to experimental treatments for AD. This proposal focuses on deriving eﬀective presymptomatic and early symptomatic AD biomarkers from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the imaging modality that provides the most direct evidence of neuritic and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disease. Rather than propose new MRI acquisition protocols, we focus on the most commonly collected type of MRI scan in AD research (T1-weighted 3D gradient echo scans with approximately 1x1x1mm3 resolution) and use advanced computational analysis to quantify changes in the subregions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), the brain region that associated with early stages of AD pathology as well as with early stages of multiple concomitant non-AD pathologies. Aim 1 will develop and validate advanced algorithms that combine conventional multi-atlas segmentation with deep learning to reliably extract small subregions of the MTL, such as Brodmann area 35, explicitly accounting for anatomical variability in the MTL. Aim 2 will correlate quantitative digital pathology measures derived at autopsy with antemortem MRI to discover distinct patterns of change that we hypothesize are associated with concomitant pathologies in AD, including TDP-43 pathology, alpha-synucleinopathy, non-AD tauopathies, and cerebrovascular disease. Aim 3 will apply deep learning to improve the sensitivity of measures of change in longitudinal MRI, hypothetically leading to a more sensitive early marker of treatment eﬀectiveness in trials targeting preclinical AD than existing cognitive and imaging-based measures. Taken together, improved precision of segmentation (Aim 1), determination of spatial patterns of AD and concomitant non-AD pathology (Aim 2), and advanced longitudinal measurement methodology (Aim 3) will optimize MTL subregional sensitivity and speciﬁcity for the earliest neurodegenerative changes of AD, providing a potentially critical therapeutic eﬃcacy measure to accelerate clinical trials of disease modifying treatments in early AD. Treatments for Alzheimer's disease will likely be most eﬀective if applied before patients begin to develop symptoms of cognitive decline. But clinical trials in individuals who do not yet have any symptoms of disease can take a very long time and be very costly. This project uses common magnetic resonance imaging exams and artiﬁcial intelligence tools to detect subtle changes over time in parts of the brain where damage speciﬁcally due to Alzheimer's disease ﬁrst occurs, providing clinical trials with a faster way to determine if treatments are being eﬀective.",Improving the sensitivity and specificity of MRI-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease,10235472,RF1AG069474,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer associated neurodegeneration', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Brodmann&apos', 's area', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'computational atlas', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'digital pathology', 'disease heterogeneity', 'empowered', 'experimental arm', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'phase III trial', 'pre-clinical', 'protein TDP-43', 'recruit', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'synucleinopathy', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,RF1,2021,2094490
"Gene Profile Analysis of Associations between Alzheimer’s Disease and Circadian Rhythmic Patterns of Human Brain Regions Using Machine Learning Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia, and it has an increasing death rate throughout the world. It gradually damages a patient’s memory, speech, thinking, and ability to perform routine activities. While a few drugs may temporarily relieve some mild early AD symptoms, they cannot stop or reverse cognitive and memory impairment. Multiple studies have shown that circadian rhythm and AD have a close, intricate, bidirectional relationship. Accumulating evidence indicates that the disorder of circadian rhythm is not only a pathological marker but a putative risk factor of AD. Improved understanding of the relationship between AD and the circadian rhythm has the potential to guide the development of effective AD interventions or treatment. Timed gene expression data human brains are rare because of its highly invasive nature. In general, brain gene expression studies in neurodegeneration are based on post-mortem tissue samples with no or inaccurate, if any, time labels. Currently, there is a pending need for characterizing molecular mechanisms which underlie the relationship of AD with human brain circadian rhythms. However, effective methods are yet to be developed to analyze whole-genome gene expression data with none or inaccurate time labels to discover AD-specific differentiated circadian rhythmic patterns. Toward filling this urgent unmet need, our overall aim is to develop innovative algorithms to discover circadian oscillation patterns based on genome-wide gene profile analysis, and leverage them to identify and understand the associations of AD with circadian rhythms of different brain regions. This project will bridge a critical methodological gap to enable innovative discovery from untimed high- dimensional human brain data. It has a great potential to advance the understanding of the impact of circadian rhythm on AD, and also provide researchers with a host of potential therapeutic targets for AD, e.g., rhythmic synchronization of brain regions, to guide the development of future interventions. This project is highly innovative. For the first time, gene profile analysis based on untimed expression data of tens of thousands of genes will be performed to pinpoint the AD-specific differentiated rhythmic patterns of different brain regions. To our knowledge, this is the only capacity of its kind, which permits the most direct glimpse into the circadian events in the human brain at the brain region- or tissue-level. The algorithms will be used to find oscillation patterns and rhythmic correlations between brain regions for cohorts with or without AD and unique subsets of AD patients. Because a clear understanding between AD and the disturbances of human brain circadian rhythms is elusive, deciphering oscillation patterns of brain regions and accounting for patient heterogeneity should advance our understanding of the complexity of AD and its intricate relationship with circadian rhythms of regions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This R21 study is a retrospective study, and we will conduct genome-wide analyses of secondary untimed gene expression data in existing large-scale databases of randomized cohorts for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The goal is to discover circadian oscillation patterns and using them to pinpoint associations of AD with circadian rhythms of human brain regions to guide future development of interventions.",Gene Profile Analysis of Associations between Alzheimer’s Disease and Circadian Rhythmic Patterns of Human Brain Regions Using Machine Learning,10126568,R21AG070909,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Circadian Rhythm Disorder', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Dementia', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sample Size', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'circadian', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'gene expression database', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large-scale database', 'patient subsets', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R21,2021,420750
"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome-Wide Association Studies One promise of precision medicine for Alzheimer’s disease is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association in subjects ascertained with and without Alzheimer’s. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine for Alzheimer’s by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual Alzheimer’s patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to Alzheimer’s clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial Alzheimer’s data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on Alzheimer’s patients derived from a population-level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and Alzheimer’s disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the Alzheimer’s clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated Alzheimer’s knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source to the Alzheimer’s disease research community (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of Alzheimer’s disease result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help Alzheimer’s clinicians and researchers connect population-level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat Alzheimer’s patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome-Wide Association Studies,10284977,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'base', 'data preservation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual', 'virtual intervention']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,391879
"Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting tens of millions of people. A top research priority in AD is to find a biomarker sensitive to early disease and disease progression because that will likely provide the best opportunities for searching and evaluating effective treatments for this currently incurable brain disease. Human brain relies on cerebral blood flow (CBF) for its energy supply and waste removal. Previous research has indicated that CBF reductions cause neuron inactivity and neurotoxic waste accumulation and subsequently neuron death, which may eventually lead to AD dementia. Measuring CBF and following its longitudinal course may then provide a highly potential biomarker for early AD and its progression. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI is a technique for quantifying CBF without using exogenous tracers. Because it is relatively cheaper and can be repeated many times, it is well suited for longitudinal AD research. Sensitivity of ASL MRI to AD and prodromal AD has been shown in many cross-sectional studies (comparing AD to controls) by other groups and us. But several important questions still remain unanswered including the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD and AD progression, the longitudinal CBF change patterns, and sex difference of CBF in AD. Addressing those questions needs large size longitudinal data and expertise for analyzing ASL MRI data due to the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The purpose of this project is to address those open questions by leveraging our extensive expertise on ASL MRI and the accumulating longitudinal ASL data from ADNI (a large ongoing multi-site AD neuroimaging study). The novel information or outcome from this project will include the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD, CBF change rate when disease progresses or reverts, gender effects in AD and its progression, and a next-generation ASL MRI processing algorithm based on deep-machine learning (DL), and a DL-based AD prediction model. We will first confirm our previous ADNI ASL CBF findings using larger sample and updated methods (not available before). We will then check sensitivity of ASL CBF for tracking and predicting disease progression or cognitive declines. Gender effects on CBF in AD will be explicitly examined, which may reveal a clue for the higher prevalence of AD in females. We will revisit those studies using the DL-based ASL denoising algorithm. Pursuing those aims will help establishing ASL CBF as an AD biomarker and provide a versatile AD prediction model using ASL CBF as well as other valuable biomarkers provided in ADNI. Developing and sharing the DL ASL MRI denoising method will benefit not only AD research but also the various scientific projects based on ASL MRI. The feasibility of this innovative but clinically important project is ensured by our decades of experience and the substantial pilot investigations in each aspect of the study, including ASL MRI, AD ASL study, and machine learning. Identifying biomarkers sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its progression is central to AD studies. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) will be measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI and assessed for early AD detection and progression monitoring. We will also develop a next-generation ASL denoising technique to further improve ASL CBF SNR and reliability. Given our aging population and the increasing prevalence of AD, performing this project is likely to have significant public health impact. Developing the proposed technique will benefit not only AD study but the general neuroimaging research.",Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression,10105251,R01AG060054,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Energy Supply', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Spin Labels', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Update', 'Woman', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain metabolism', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'glucose metabolism', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal course', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'neurotoxic', 'neurovascular', 'next generation', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prodromal Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'rate of change', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'technique development', 'wasting']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,446131
"Multi-omic functional assessment of novel AD variants using high-throughput and single-cell technologies PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Through decades of research, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified heritable coding and noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that lead to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the vast majority of these SNPs remain largely under-characterized, and their contribution to AD pathogenesis remains unclear, marking a critical roadblock to our understanding of AD genetics and pathogenesis. While SNPs within the APOE and TREM2 genes have identified vital nodes in AD biology, most AD-related SNPs reside within the noncoding genome, making their functional roles in the disease less clear. Co-inheritance of nearby SNPs (linkage disequilibrium) and the cell type-specificity of noncoding regulatory elements further complicate functional annotation of noncoding SNPs in AD. As part of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Functional Genomics Consortium (ADSP FGC), this project will provide a robust and conclusive functional characterization of AD-related noncoding SNPs. To do this, we will first create a comprehensive single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility across a cohort of diverse clinico-pathologic states related to AD (Aim 1). Using these cell type-specific gene regulatory landscapes, we will develop and implement innovative machine learning and statistical genomics methods to predict functional noncoding, splicing, and coding SNPs (Aim 2). We will then validate these predictions using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and large-scale, scarless, single-base CRISPR editing of iPSCs followed by cell type-specific differentiations (Aim 3). Taken together (Aim 4), this project will pinpoint the functional SNPs and target cell types for dozens of AD-related risk loci and provide an unprecedented picture of the gene regulatory landscape of AD. This work will be performed as a joint collaboration between Stanford University and the Gladstone Institutes at UCSF. Our team, with many long-standing collaborations, has extensive experience in consortium science with long-term involvement in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and The Genotype-Tissue Expression Project. The proposed project is thus well- positioned to integrate into the highly collaborative ADSP Functional Genomics Consortium. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease, the third most common cause of mortality in the United States, and a looming public health crisis. Despite over a decade of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), our understanding of the genetics of this devastating disease remains incomplete, as functional validation of relevant polymorphisms has proved challenging. Through a platform of multi-omic single-cell data generation, innovative machine learning and statistical genomics refinement, and functional characterization, we will pinpoint AD-relevant polymorphisms that will identify novel aspects of disease pathogenesis and nominate candidate avenues for therapeutic intervention.",Multi-omic functional assessment of novel AD variants using high-throughput and single-cell technologies,10217784,U01AG072573,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Specificity', 'TREM2 gene', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'presenilin-1', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'single cell technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'syntax', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,1698183
"Characterization of Alternative Polyadenylation in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressive brain disorder characterized by cognitive decline, irreversible memory loss, disorientation, and language impairment. Recent advances in genomic technologies and the explosive genomic information related to disease have accelerated the convergence of discovery science with clinical medicine. We aim to utilize cutting-edge techniques in computational biology, RNA biology, and systems biology to identify novel prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers and to develop innovative therapeutic strategies for AD. We will establish a comprehensive archive of human polyadenylation sites by combining various APA databases. We will train a reliable deep neural network (DNN) model by considering both cis ad trans factors, and then apply this DNN prediction model to characterize APA events in AD samples across several AD consortia (Aim 1.1). We will develop highly efficient and accurate approaches based on deep learning to identify apaQTLs in order to maximize the utility of genotyping data to understand the functional effects of genetic variants in AD. We will perform integrative analysis with multi-omics data generated by other projects to understand the regulatory network, aiming to provide additional evidence for functional interpretation of apaQTLs in AD (Aim 1.2). We will perform integrative analysis with our established rigorous computational approaches to identify APA events associated with AD traits, in order to identify novel prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for AD (Aim 2.1). To facilitate the utilization of large-scale data by the broad biomedical community, we will develop a comprehensive data resource to provide a computational framework that enables user-friendly interactive exploration and visualization of the biomedical significance of APA events (Aim 2.2). We expect to build a critical foundation to demonstrate that APA events represent novel types of biomarkers and serve as promising therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes. Our proposed research could pave the innovative way for aiding precision medicine because we will develop highly innovative computational framework based on deep learning to identify APA events and perform apaQTL analysis to identify a novel class of APA-based biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

"A Study of Race Differences in Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Abstract  We propose to combine mass spectrometry and machine learning to address racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. While African Americans have two to three times the incidence rates of AD than people of European Ancestry, they are underrepresented in past and current AD research studies. The lack of representation leads to a weaker understanding of disease progression and poorer diagnostics for this population. The overarching premise, that advances in diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease for all Americans will be stymied unless differences among racial groups are considered, is supported by the literature and demonstrated with preliminary data in the application. The aims of this proposal are, therefore, designed to specifically address the need for a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease in minority groups and to increase the diversity of patients that could be correctly diagnosed with serum-based biomarker panels for AD. Successful completion of the proposed research would accomplish several objectives: We would identify optimal feature selection methods for `omics data; generate the best possible plasma biomarker panel for AD in African Americans; and provide a systematic investigation of the extent to which existing MS- `omics studies' accuracy of predicting AD are modulated by the participants' race.

"Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a growing epidemic, and potential treatments are unlikely to be effective unless deployed during the earliest stages of AD, prior to cognitive symptoms. Currently there are no inexpensive, non-invasive biomarkers for effective AD screening necessary for early recognition and treatment on a broad scale. Sleep is abnormal in preclinical AD, even prior to cognitive symptoms, and disrupted sleep may in turn accelerate AD pathological mechanisms. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures brain function, and the stereotyped nature of sleep EEG offers a particularly rich opportunity to identify biomarkers of brain dysfunction due to AD. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that sleep-wake brain mechanisms are abnormal very early in AD, and can be detected via subtle but distinct sleep and EEG changes. The objective is to develop sleep and EEG biomarkers of AD, to enable non-invasive and inexpensive screening on a large scale, through the following specific aims.  Aim 1) Identify sleep-wake patterns across the 24-hour day characteristic of AD pathology. Ambulatory sleep-EEG data will be recorded over the 24-hour period in the home setting from a large, diverse, community-based cohort, with the hypothesis that increased sleep-wake transitions over the 24-hour day are characteristic of preclinical-to-mild AD. Aim 2) Assess slow wave integrity measures as biomarkers of AD pathology. EEG abnormalities of slow wave sleep are particularly associated with elevated amyloid-β levels and plaques. Novel analytic techniques will extract bihemispheric slow wave coherence, slow wave velocity, and slow wave intradaily ratio from EEG data collected during sleep and wake. The hypothesis is that amyloid plaques present in early AD will reduce slow wave integrity by all three measures. Aim 3) Determine the EEG signature of AD using machine learning. Machine learning techniques will be applied to EEG from a full attended overnight polysomnogram, to identify a “signature” of AD pathology. The goal is to identify a “signature” that can be detected with spatially limited EEG data that could be collected at home.  The expected outcome of these aims is to identify sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD that can be detected noninvasively and inexpensively at home. The impact of our work will be the ability to screen large populations easily for AD pathology, so that affected individuals can be identified and treated. Moreover, sleep-EEG biomarkers could be used to track disease progression and treatment response in clinical trials for AD. Lastly, since sleep disturbance has a direct effect on AD pathology, by identifying sleep-EEG changes very early in the pathological process, we may be able to intervene, improve sleep, and potentially change the trajectory of AD.  ! Project Narrative Combating the looming crisis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will require identifying and treating individuals with AD even before cognitive symptoms appear. The proposed project will develop sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD in a large, diverse, community-based cohort, which can be used for inexpensive, non-invasive screening for AD on a broad scale. This project will enable large-scale screening and treatment of early AD, use of sleep-EEG theranostic biomarkers for clinical and drug-development purposes, and intervention for sleep disturbances to potentially change the trajectory of AD.",Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,10167595,R01AG059507,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Drug Development', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Napping', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Race', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'early detection biomarkers', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep onset', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'tau Proteins', 'theranostics', 'treatment response']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,384934
"National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, where currently 5.8 million people are living with AD dementias, and this number is projected to almost triple to 13.8 million by 2050. In addition AD and related dementias (AD/ADRD) healthcare costs for people ≥65 years were an estimated $277 billion in 2018. Although putative risk and protective factors have been identified, published studies have been unable to identify how to prevent and mitigate disease progression and who is most vulnerable mostly because the existing studies are based on small sample size and lack statistical power to disentangle the effects of different factors. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (a ubiquitous yet modifiable exposure dangerous to the aging brain) has been associated with decreased cognitive function, faster cognitive decline, dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Toxicological and human studies provide evidence of an association between air pollution and neurodegeneration, highlighting potential biological pathways that include systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. In response to PAR-17-054, our goal is to leverage massive nationwide datasets (Medicare and Medicaid), coupled with advanced statistical methods, to overcome the limitations of existing studies and clarify risk and protective factors for AD/ADRD. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will conduct national epidemiological studies using Medicare and Medicaid claims for the period 2000-2021 for the continental US, to estimate the association between exposure to air pollution and the time to the first AD/ADRD hospitalization. Among enrollees that have been hospitalized for AD/ADRD or MCI we will assess whether air pollution exposure increases risk of mortality, and/or accelerates re-hospitalization for AD/ADRD. In Aim 2 we will apply machine learning methods to identify co-occurrence of individual-level (previous hospitalizations, race, age, and sex), environmental (weather, green space, and noise), and SES risk (or protective) factors to determine which population subgroups are most/least at risk for AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression following air pollution exposure. In Aim 3 we will develop methods to overcome statistical challenges including (1) disentangle the effects of air pollution exposure from other confounding factors by leveraging approaches for causal inference, and (2) correct for potential outcome misclassification. We will conduct side-by-side epidemiological analyses using traditional methods (e.g. regression) and causal inference and machine learning approaches to understand which statistical challenges require more sophisticated approaches. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we will provide peer-reviewed open-source software so other investigators may implement our methods. In summary the results of this proposal will characterize the link between air pollution exposure and AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression, will identify the multiple modifiable risk and protective factors that determine vulnerability in AD/ADRD, and provide the foundation for implementable actions to prevent and reduce this enormous health burden. This project will leverage data on two cohorts (Medicaid and Medicare enrollees) to characterize the impact of air pollution on risk for and progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), and identify the complex interactions of individual-level, environmental and societal factors that lead to increased vulnerability in AD/ADRD. We will develop innovative, transparent, and reproducible methods to address current statistical challenges including outcome misclassification. We will determine the impact of multiple inter-related environmental protective and risk factors to address the multi-factorial AD/ADRD health burden.","National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution",10134188,R01AG066793,"['Address', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Biological', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Ozone', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Side', 'Societal Factors', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weather', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'fine particles', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nanoparticle', 'open source', 'prevent', 'protective factors', 'response', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'systemic inflammatory response']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2021,732992
"Genome Center for Alzheimer's Disease (GCAD) Overall Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects 5.8 million people in the United States, and is an immense burden on patients, caregivers and on the economy. No disease-modifying treatments or preventions exist, and we need better understanding of the disease and new therapeutic strategies. Genetic discoveries are one source of candidate therapeutic targets. One source of genetic targets is the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), a National Institute on Aging (NIA) initiative since 2012 to sequence genomes and exomes of AD subjects and cognitively normal elderly controls. The Genome Center for Alzheimer’s Disease (GCAD) is the analysis coordinating center for the ADSP. In the previous grant cycle, GCAD processed all AD-relevant sequencing data producing harmonized genetic data for AD research. This renewal responds to the increase in the amount and complexity of ADSP sequence data, the collection of new types of data, and an expansion of the types of analysis being performed. In addition to sequence data, GCAD will harmonize functional genomics data. GCAD will provide fully quality-controlled and annotated genetic and functional genomics data that is analysis ready. In addition to AD, GCAD will also work with data for AD related disorders (ADRD). These include frontotemporal dementias (FTDs), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PD-d). In the Y6-10 funding period, GCAD will assemble and harmonize whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data, and provide it to ADSP investigators and the general scientific community. GCAD will work with US and non-US groups to analyze data by fostering a collaborative environment, and providing infrastructure support. GCAD will also assemble and harmonize functional genomics data which will be integral to identifying genes as candidate drug targets. The research plan will lead to a high quality, comprehensive, harmonized collection of genetic and functional data with detailed supporting resources including documentation and optimized computer codes. This resource will be invaluable for the entire AD research community. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a serious public health issue without treatment, although scientists are making genetic discoveries that could lead to new therapeutic strategies. In the Y6-10 funding period, GCAD will assemble and harmonize sequencing data from more than 80,000 genomes as a community resource, and coordinate analysis of these data.

"Precision Brain Health Monitoring for Alzheimer's Disease Risk Detection in the Framingham Study Project Summary The path to effective treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) depends on disease detection that occurs before it is too late to reverse progression. Amyloid beta (Aß) is the widely accepted ""gold standard"" biomarker of AD and current methods for measuring this biomarker rely on positron emission tomography (PET) scans and/or analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These AD biomarker acquisition methods, however, are expensive, invasive, and difficult to scale and reliance on these approaches have exacerbated racial and ethnic disparities in AD research. Digital technologies offer an alternative method for clinical phenotyping that can detect AD-related changes well before the threshold of clinical symptom severity meets diagnostic criteria. Further, digital phenotyping makes possible the identification and validation of digital biomarkers by determining digital indices that correlate highly with more widely-accepted biological biomarkers. Within this context, this application seeks to capitalize on the opportunistic timing of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) middle-aged Generation 3 and Omni Generations 2 cohorts as participants return for their NHLBI-funded 4th health examination. The NHLBI funding, however, only covers costs associated with about 20% of the health exam components. The remaining 80% of the health exam will be determined by ancillary studies such as the project proposed here. This project aims to add two new components to the Gen 3/OmniGen 2 health exam. Aim 1 proposes conducting a novel lens Aβ eye scan that pairs a topically-applied fluorescent Aβ-binding ligand with a specialized spectroscopic eye scanner that can detect Aß deposition in the lens of the eye and has demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity to detect early AD-related Aβ pathology compared to amyloid-PET brain scans. Aim 2 seeks to use a smartphone application to collect 3 years of longitudinal cognitive metrics from which to characterize those with stable cognition versus declining cognition. Proposed analyses across these two aims will test the overall hypothesis that novel digital cognitive profiles that are unique combinations of digital features (e.g., item-specific responses, latencies, error rates, acoustic and linguistic measures) can detect those who are lens Aβ positive and/or at high AD risk (e.g., high cardiovascular risk, ApoE4+, family history of dementia, women, age >60+). Aim 3 will further apply traditional a priori and novel data-driven machine learning computational tools to construct multi-marker profiles that are highly predictive (AUC > .85) of stable cognition and cognitive decline. We posit that machine learning methods will generate more highly predictive models specific to digital cognitive profiles as compared to a priori methods. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to collect a novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker and longitudinal digital cognitive data using a smartphone. Together these data will allow testing the overall hypothesis that it is possible to detect preclinical AD at a much earlier age than previously assumed.",Precision Brain Health Monitoring for Alzheimer's Disease Risk Detection in the Framingham Study,10214162,RF1AG072654,"['Acoustics', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Crystalline Lens', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Eye', 'Family history of', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Response Latencies', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Topical application', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abeta accumulation', 'abeta deposition', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data resource', 'dementia risk', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'indexing', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'middle age', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'sex', 'smartphone Application', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,RF1,2021,1836408
"Optogenetic dissection of cellular and circuit mechanisms of network dysfunction and amyloid deposition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease in vivo SUMMARY A contributing factor to the failure of clinical trials has been the translational limitations of transgenic (TG) overexpression models in which physiological and endogenously-regulated pathogenic interactions are not achieved. In addition, standard behavioral tests may lack sensitivity to identify robust and reproducible behavioral deficits in newly develop knock-in (KI) models. To address or mitigate these limitations, we propose to study the next generation of newly developed KI mouse models of AD without transgene overexpression using the latest machine learning approaches for behavioral phenotyping and chronic wireless EEG/EMG recordings. Specifically, we propose to study knock-in (KI) mice that express humanized Ab under the control of the mouse App locus with or without FAD mutations, including AppAβ/Aβ, AppNL-F/NL-F, and AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice using state-of- the-art chronic in vivo electrophysiological recordings and machine learning approaches for behavioral phenotyping. The parent grant heavily focuses on the J20 TG model of AD, because App-KI mice show no prominent cognitive deficits in standard behavioral tests, including the Morris water maze test,10 and because it is unknown if App-KI have robust network abnormalities described in J20 and other TG-APP mouse models and AD patients, including altered gamma oscillations, theta-gamma coupling, epileptiform spikes and seizures.1,3,9,11- 15. The proposed experiments and genotypes expand the focus of our parent grant and will develop tools and procedures that will be directly used by the parent grant to improve behavioral and brain network characterization of TG and KI models of AD. We propose the following aims: Aim 1. Develop and apply machine learning approaches to identify behavioral alterations in late-onset AppAβ/Aβ and early-onset AppNL-F/NL-F and AppNL-G-F/NL- G-F AD mice. Aim 2. Determine electrophysiological phenotypes by chronic wireless EEG/EMG recordings during aging and disease progression in late-onset AppAβ/Aβ and early-onset AppNL-F/NL-F and AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F AD mice. Aim 3. Determine relationships between behavioral alterations and neuronal network dysfunction in late-onset AppAβ/Aβ and early-onset AppNL-F/NL-F and AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F AD mice. In addition, this diversity supplement grant will significantly enhance the research potential of the candidate and further her ability to pursue a research career. The candidate will gain valuable relevant experience with electrophysiological data analysis and mouse behavioral assays during the funding period. These novel in vivo approaches and technical skills will help the candidate to address unexplored questions of AD pathogenesis, thereby creating a technical and conceptual path towards independence. The proposed supplement will provide the conceptual and technological foundation needed to support the production of preliminary data for the candidate’s future F32 grant application. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes altered neuronal network activity and cognitive decline, but the underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms of network dysfunction remain unclear. We will use state-of-the-art in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetic manipulations of distinct inhibitory cell types and principal cells to identify cell, circuit, and network mechanisms of network dysfunction in the J20 and APP-KI mouse models. The cellular resolution and the mechanistic power of our experimental approach will likely identify clinically relevant functional endpoints that can guide functional imaging research in AD patients.",Optogenetic dissection of cellular and circuit mechanisms of network dysfunction and amyloid deposition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease in vivo,10395099,RF1AG062234,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Applications Grants', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Impaired cognition', 'J20 mouse', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Sleep', 'Technical Expertise', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Wireless Technology', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'cell type', 'circadian', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'early onset', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'knockin animal', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'overexpression', 'parent grant', 'tool', 'transgenic model of alzheimer disease']",NIA,J.

"Multivariate methods for identifying multi-task/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers ABSTRACT: The focus of this supplement request is to leverage and reinforce our ongoing biomarker identification work with methods specifically focusing on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD). Deep learning methods that we are developing in the parent grant can produce an optimal performance based on learning end-to-end directly from the data. Our goal is to leverage models trained to classify AD from the full brain fMRI dynamics for capturing novel dynamic biomarkers of AD via trained model introspection. However, it is notoriously difficult to train models to predict directly from full brain dynamics without prior dimensionality reduction. To overcome this difficulty, we will develop self-supervised approaches that would take advantage of unrelated datasets and provide a performance boost that would allow obtaining reliable classification improvements even on small data. This improved classification directly transfers into more reliable introspection of why the model classifies subjects to AD. We plan to improve the robustness of these predictive/introspective methods and study these full-brain fMRI dynamic measures in younger adults who have CSF risk markers assessed for AD in order to evaluate the potential for leveraging such models as biomarkers of AD.

"Plasma Cell-Free RNA as Non-invasive Biomarker for Neurodegeneration Project Summary / Abstract Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Pathological changes in the brain can be observed at least 15 years before clinical symptoms (preclinical stage). An early and accurate diagnosis tool could save $7.9 trillion in medical and care costs. Moreover, an effective therapeutic strategy could improve the clinical outcome if delivered early. There is a clear need to develop cost-effective and non-invasive biomarkers for AD that can be used to identify individuals before symptoms emerge and patients at early-symptomatic stages of disease. These novel biomarkers could be also leveraged to monitor disease progression and responses to therapies. Cell-free nucleic acids diagnostic tests have revolutionized prenatal screening, and cancer research, diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, specific transcripts ascertained from cell-free RNA have been evaluated as biomarkers for AD, but so far, no high throughput approach has been attempted. The goal of this proposal is to use high throughput sequencing of cell-free nucleic acids from plasma to construct a prediction model for neurodegenerative diseases. I hypothesize that there are detectable changes in plasma cell-free nucleic acids that are related to AD. During the K99 phase, I aim to predict accurately AD cases using cell-free nucleic acid and bioinformatics tools, including machine learning. Briefly, I will sequence cell-free RNA present in longitudinal samples of plasma from AD cases and controls, then build a predictive model. I will replicate this model in an independent dataset of preclinical samples. I will include samples from mutation carriers and non-European ancestry to validate the model. I will also determine if the model can predict other neurodegenerative diseases or if it is specific to AD by quantifying plasma transcripts from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. My preliminary data show that this approach is feasible. I designed a preliminary predictive model with 10 AD cases and 10 controls that has an area under the ROC curve of 1; then I replicated it in independent samples (n=20) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.84. In four preclinical samples the ROC was 0.86 suggesting that my model can also identify pre-symptomatic individuals. It is possible to improve this model by using more powerful informatics approaches. Using deep neural networks, I obtained a ROC of 1 in the discovery dataset and 0.94 in the replication dataset. During the R00 phase, I plan to use the same approach on other neurodegenerative diseases to design specific predictive models. I will generate sequence data on the RNA present in longitudinal plasma samples of cases and controls from Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies to construct specific predictive models for each of them. Then I will replicate the models in preclinical samples of these diseases. Combining the information on all neurodegenerative diseases will also allow me to refine the predictive model and perform integrative analyses to describe mechanistic insights. My ultimate goal is to be able to use the predictive models as diagnostic tools, and if possible, as early diagnostic tests. The preliminary data is encouraging and opens the possibility of having plasma-based tests for neurodegeneration. Project Narrative This proposal will use transcriptomic data from plasma to model a predictive tool for Alzheimer Disease using bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. This is an innovative approach, a cost-effective and minimally invasive biomarker for Alzheimer Disease, which is critical for early detection (preclinical), diagnosis, disease intervention and monitoring.

"Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center 1. SUMMARY (Overall) The National Alzheimer's Project Act establishes an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease (AD); develop treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse the course of AD; improve the early diagnosis of AD; and decrease disparities in AD for ethnic and racial minority populations at higher risk for AD. In this context, AD is intended to encompass AD-related dementias, including dementia with Lewy bodies. In support of the goals and research milestones of the National Alzheimer's Project Act, the mission of the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) is to serve as a shared resource to facilitate and enhance research on AD and the spectrum of cognitive impairment associated with Lewy body (LB) pathology. We follow a strategy of deep phenotyping, believing that critical answers emerge more readily when investigators are able to delve deeply within and across multiple levels of participant data. Healthy adults without cognitive or motor impairment serve both as a comparison (control) population and as a preclinical population in which mechanisms of cognitive aging and clinical transition can be studied. People with Parkinson's disease without cognitive impairment also serve as comparators and as an at-risk transitional population for the development of cognitive impairment linked to LB pathology. ADRC resources will provide investigators with unique opportunities for the parallel study of these two neurodegenerative disorders, enabling insights into pathogenesis, preclinical diagnosis, transitions, resistance and resilience, and therapeutic approaches. Aims of the Stanford ADRC are to (1) provide an administrative structure that advances the mission of the center; (2) develop and maintain human resources for studies of the AD spectrum and the LB spectrum of cognitive impairment, as well as cognitive aging; (3) make available well-characterized brain tissues, brain-derived biospecimens, and quantitative molecular data derived from high-content imaging of brain tissues; (4) make available participant biospecimens and high-content biospecimen data; (5) provide structural, functional, and molecular neuroimaging biomarkers in support of research on AD-spectrum cognitive impairment, LB-spectrum cognitive impairment, and cognitive aging; (6) provide for the management of Stanford ADRC data, prepare research datasets, provide high-level biostatistical consultation for ADRC investigators, and support research on big data using tools from biostatistics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence; (7) with our community partners, provide respectful, culturally sensitive outreach and provide opportunities for education, training, and research participation for healthy adults, people with AD-spectrum and LB-spectrum disorders, and their families. Stanford ADRC outreach and community engagement extends particularly to urban Hispanic/Latino older adults, an important Bay Area population, which is under-represented in AD-related research; and (8) support the training of investigators and future leaders in the field of AD and related dementia.

"Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology. Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple health threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, efforts in drug discovery and repurposing for the treatment of AD have had limited success. The failure is largely attributed to the adoption of a reductionist model of “one-drug-one-gene- one-disease”. As AD is a multi-facet complex disease, a new treatment approach is urgently needed to simultaneously target multiple pathological processes responsible for the onset and progress of AD, some of which are also common to other diseases that cause dementia. In this application, we will develop an innovative translational bioinformatics approach to addressing challenges in AD drug discovery. Our approach is based on a new paradigm of systems pharmacology, which focuses on defining multiple targets to a single drug or a drug combination, and studying the effect of the drug(s) on perturbing disease-causing networks. Over the last ten years, we have developed a novel structural systems pharmacology (SSP) platform that can predict genome-wide high-resolution protein-chemical interactions and correlate molecular interactions with phenotype responses. The SSP platform synergistically combines novel methods from machine learning, bioinformatics, biophysics, and systems biology. We have successfully applied the SSP platform to drug repurposing, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, precision medicine, and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, and in close collaborations with experimental laboratories, we will develop, and rigorously test a novel SSP approach to AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology. Firstly, we will develop a drug-gene-disease multi-layered network model (MULAN) that links FDA-approved drugs with neurodegenerative diseases through protein-chemical interactions, gene- disease associations, and chemical-disease associations through integrating multiple omics data. Secondly, we will improve and apply our proven successful SSP platform, which can accurately infer novel relations from sparse and noisy MULAN, to identify safe FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed for AD treatment. Finally, we will experimentally test FDA-approved drugs identified for their binding activity of drug targets and anti-AD potency in cell and animal models. The successful completion of this project will provide an integrated computational modeling framework for AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology as well as identify novel targeted anti-AD therapeutics toward pre-clinical trials. Relevance Statement Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, AD is a complex disease that has been extremely hard to treat with the conventional approach. New methods that can reuse old drugs to target mulple pathological processes in AD may provide new solutions to effective AD treatment.",Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology.,10147838,R01AG057555,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biophysics', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diazoxide', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Human', 'Inflammation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'clinical application', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug repurposing', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical development', 'preclinical trial', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutically effective', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2021,779392
"Delaying Alzheimer's Disease Progression Through Intranasally Administered Nano-Antioxidants Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the neuropathological accumulation of amyloid beta (Ab) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau. Recent data from multiple groups support that given enough time, Ab and tau spreads throughout the brain in a well-defined manner along brain networks, very similar to the way a prion protein travels throughout the brain. Notably, the olfactory system has been reported to be one of the first systems affected in AD. Our past work has focused on using Manganese Enhanced MRI (MEMRI) to assess axonal transport in the olfactory system in mouse models of AD. Indeed, we have reported that axonal transport deficits in the olfactory system are detectable prior to the development of learning and memory deficits and well before plaque formation. These data are consistent with the idea that AD pathology spreads throughout the brain, beginning with the olfactory system. Additionally, our prior work has also focused on the effects of reducing oxidative stress in mouse models of AD. When we reduced oxidative stress by overexpressing superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD-2) in mouse models of AD, we observed a complete recovery in learning and memory deficits, a complete recovery in axonal transport deficits in the olfactory system as well as an over 50% reduction in Ab plaque formation. Although oxidative stress has been identified as a significant player in the development of AD, efforts to reduce oxidative stress with antioxidants has met with limited success. Some of the reasons for this are thought to include the inability to target sufficient quantities of administered antioxidants to the appropriate regions within the brain. Additionally, clinically available antioxidants have poor solubility and do not readily enter cells. Thus, we have turned to nanotechnology and have been working with nano-antioxidants that are much more potent than clinically available antioxidants, are non-toxic and readily enter cells. We therefore hypothesize that protecting olfactory and adjoining structures with intranasally administered nano-antioxidants (PEG-HCCs) will slow down the progression of AD as assessed with behavioral assays, MEMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) as well as 31P measurements and histology. We will also incorporate machine learning, specifically, a probabilistic graphical model, to determine the interactions of the readouts in Aims 1 and 2 in mouse models of AD and controls with and without treatment with PEG-HCCs. We also propose to incorporate machine learning to predict 1) the degree to which superoxide levels should be reduced to improve AD pathology and 2) which stages of AD (e.g. pre vs post plaque) are beyond rescue. Completion of this highly innovative project will have significant impact towards future AD therapeutic strategies. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are conducting research that will advance our understanding of network spread that occurs in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) leading from the olfactory system but also the roles of oxidative stress in AD. As a result, the proposed work is relevant to the component of NIH’s mission of developing novel and innovative methods such as machine learning to understand and potentially treat AD, a disease that is on the rise and has significant health consequences.",Delaying Alzheimer's Disease Progression Through Intranasally Administered Nano-Antioxidants,10395142,R56AG071152,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Axonal Transport', 'Bayesian Network', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Intranasal Administration', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Phosphocreatine', 'PrP', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'SOD2 gene', 'Senile Plaques', 'Solubility', 'Structure', 'Superoxides', 'Support Groups', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abeta accumulation', 'awake', 'behavior influence', 'disorder control', 'hyperphosphorylated tau', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mouse model', 'nano', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'sensory system', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'time use']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R56,2021,730015
"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted using chemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns, with the aim of improving the quality of spatial information carried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.",Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice,10237353,K01AG068598,"['4-Hydroxy-Tamoxifen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'J20 mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'abeta accumulation', 'attenuation', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive performance', 'combat', 'design', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'entorhinal cortex', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'learning strategy', 'memory encoding', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial memory', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2021,106388
