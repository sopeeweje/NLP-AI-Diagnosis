"Towards Generating a Multimodal and Multivariate Classification Model from Imaging and Non-Imaging Measures for Accurate Diagnosis and Monitoring of Dementia in Parkinsons disease. PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the proposed research is to identify the best predictive biomarkers of dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PDD) through a multimodal and multivariate statistical model utilizing both neuroimaging derived measures (diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and T1-weighted MRI measures) and non- imaging measures such as demographics (age, sex, years of education), clinical (disease duration and severity), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF-measures (Total Tau, β-Amyloid, α-synuclein). It is critical to identify biomarkers that can predict dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as approximately 50-80% of PD patients develop PDD within twelve years of diagnosis. Identifying pathophysiology-based biomarkers that could identify PD patients at high risk for PDD reliably is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and better understanding the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project has two important components. The first component of the project is to understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PDD through sophisticated voxelwise dMRI-derived measures estimated using a multi-shell high angular and spatial resolution dMRI data acquisition, and understanding network-level white matter (WM)-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity in PDD. The second component of the project is to identify the biomarkers that predict PDD through multivariate statistical modelling by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures (such as clinical, demographics, genetics, and CSF-measures). We will recruit demographically matched healthy controls (HC) along with demographically, disease duration, and disease severity matched PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD-non-MCI (PD-nMCI), and PDD for this project. We will acquire multi-shell dMRI data at three b-values, namely 500s/mm2, 1000s/mm2, and 2500s/mm2 with a high angular and spatial resolution and estimate various unbiased free-water (fiso) corrected Gaussian dMRI-derived measures along with non-Gaussian dMRI-derived measures such as diffusion kurtosis measures, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures. We will further compare these measures between the groups to identify significant dMRI-derived measures separating the groups, and understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of these measures with various neuropsychological scores. Furthermore, we will estimate dMRI-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity to understand network-level discrepancies predicting PDD. These pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures will be further combined with various non-imaging measures through a novel machine learning algorithm to identify the comprehensive and best predictors of PDD. The tools developed in our proposal also has great potential for significantly advancing the understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) thereby helping to understand AD- and PD-specific neuroanatomical changes predicting dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because identification of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients at a high-risk for developing dementia (PDD) is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and to better understand the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project identifies the best predictive biomarkers for PDD through examining the comprehensive Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion-MRI (dMRI)-derived white matter (WM) changes predicting PDD, examining the network-level discrepancies predicting PDD derived from dMRI-derived whole-brain structural connectivity and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI)-derived whole-brain functional connectivity, and developing a multivariate and multimodal statistical model by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures such as clinical (disease duration and severity), demographics (age, sex, years of education), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF- measures (β-Amyloid, α-Synuclein, tau) to identify the best predictive biomarkers of PDD through machine learning approach.

"Web-based Automated Imaging Differentiation of Parkinsonism SUMMARY Across the globe, there has been a considerable growth in the number of people diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Estimates indicate that from 1990 to 2015 the number of Parkinsonism diagnoses doubled, with more than 6 million people currently carrying the diagnosis, and by year 2040, 12 and 14.2 million people will be diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy Parkinsonian variant (MSAp), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are neurodegenerative forms of Parkinsonism, which can be difficult to diagnose as they share similar motor and non-motor features, and they each have an increased chance of developing dementia. In the first five years of a PD diagnosis, about 58% of PD are misdiagnosed, and of these misdiagnoses about half have either MSA or PSP. Since PD, MSAp, and PSP require unique treatment plans and different medications, and clinical trials testing new medications require the correct diagnosis, there is an urgent need for both clinic ready and clinical-trial ready markers for differential diagnosis of PD, MSAp, and PSP. Over the past decade, we have developed diffusion imaging as an innovative biomarker for differentiating PD, MSAp, and PSP. In this proposal, we will leverage our extensive experience to create a web-based software tool that can process diffusion imaging data from anywhere in the world. We will disseminate and test the tool in the largest prospective cohort of participants with Parkinsonism (PD, MSAp, PSP), working closely with the Parkinson Study Group. The reason to test this in the Parkinson Study Group network, is because they are the community that evaluates Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in Parkinsonism. This web-based software tool will be capable of reading raw diffusion imaging data, performing quality assurance procedures, analyzing the data using a validated pipeline, and providing imaging metrics and diagnostic probability. We will test the performance of the wAID-P by enrolling 315 total subjects (105 PD, 105 MSAp, 105 PSP) across 21 sites in the Parkinson Study Group. Each site will perform imaging, clinical scales, diagnosis, and will upload the data to the web-based software tool. The clinical diagnosis will be blinded to the diagnostic algorithm and the imaging diagnosis will be compared to the movement disorders trained neurologist diagnosis. We will also enroll a portion of the cohort into a brain bank to ascertain pathological confirmation and to test the algorithm against cases with post-mortem diagnoses. The final outcome will be to disseminate a validated diagnostic algorithm to the Parkinson neurological and radiological community and to make it available to all on a website. NARRATIVE In this proposal, we will be developing, disseminating, and evaluating a web-based software tool that can perform MRI analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinsonism. Our goal is to leverage our years of experience and algorithm development, to test a prospective cohort of Parkinson’s disease, Multiple System Atrophy, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. We expect that at the end of the project, we will have validated a web-based software tool that can use MRIs from different vendors to read, analyze, and predict the diagnosis of different forms of Parkinsonism.",Web-based Automated Imaging Differentiation of Parkinsonism,10106864,U01NS119562,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Water', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm development', 'atypical parkinsonism', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'data exchange', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'web site']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,U01,2021,1553260
"Uncovering the neurophysiology of motivation in ParkinsonÃÂs disease with implanted adaptive brain stimulation TITLE: UNCOVERING THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF MOTIVATION IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE WITH IMPLANTED ADAPTIVE BRAIN STIMULATION PROJECT SUMMARY Behavioral symptoms such as apathy and impulsivity represent a prevalent, highly-disabling feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and many other neurological conditions, for which treatments are currently very limited. The long-term goal of this award is to understand the neurocircuitry of motivation in order to develop precise and personalized therapies for motor and non-motor symptoms in neurological disorders. The overall objective is to establish the neural structures and signals that underpin motivation in PD. My central hypothesis is that the human motivation system comprises two functionally distinct frontal cortex - basal ganglia (FC- BG) circuits that drive behavior: 1) the prefrontal - basal ganglia circuit evaluates rewards and operates in the theta (3-7Hz) frequency range and 2) the premotor - basal ganglia circuit evaluates action costs, and is mediated by beta (13-30Hz) frequency signals, with both modulated by dopamine. Therefore, the rationale of the project is that understanding the neural structures and signals of the FC-BG reward circuit is critical for the development of effective stimulation therapies for behavioral symptoms in PD. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify the neurophysiological signatures of reward cost-benefit evaluation in PD. Patients with chronically implanted, sensing-enabled brain stimulators will perform reward cost-benefit evaluation tasks with simultaneous FC-BG recordings, on and off dopamine medication. Additionally, patients will trigger recordings of neural signals at home, with paired self-reports of apathy and impulsivity. Aim 2) Evaluate the causal relationship of frontal cortex-basal ganglia structures & signals to behavior. Spatio-temporally targeted brain stimulation will be delivered to the FC-BG network during reward cost-benefit evaluation to test the causal role of these structures and signals to motivated behavior. The research is innovative because it uses a) chronic invasive brain recordings, in patients, during behavioral tasks that index motivation, b) recordings at home to determine within-subject reproducibility and link to naturalistic motivational states and c) causal interventions to demonstrate mechanistic relationships. It is significant because determining an accurate understanding of the neurocircuitry of reward will enable the future development of precise, spatio-temporally targeted adaptive brain stimulation for apathy and impulsivity in PD, a major unmet need. As such, Dr. Little has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring group led by Prof. Philip Starr and supported by advisors Profs. Edward Chang, Wendy Mendes and Joshua Berke to develop a comprehensive structured training plan involving 1) cognitive-affective neuroscience 2) electrocorticography 3) machine learning and 4) trial design and statistics. This award will propel Dr. Little towards independence and expertise in the investigation of the neurophysiology, and treatment, of motor and non-motor neurological symptoms. It will also provide the foundation for a future R01 application investigating the relationship between clinical apathy, impulsivity and neurophysiology in a wide cohort of neurological patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Personalized, adaptive, brain stimulation has the potential to benefit disabling behavioral symptoms such as apathy and impulsivity across a wide range of neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, but is currently limited by a lack of understanding of how the brain assesses rewards to drive actions. The goal of this project is to determine how rewards are evaluated across the frontal cortex - basal ganglia circuits and to evaluate the mechanistic role of the structures and signals of this network in Parkinson’s disease. This foundational understanding will direct future stimulation therapies to reduce the burden of apathy and impulsivity in Parkinson’s disease and other neurological disorders in a precise and principled manner.",Uncovering the neurophysiology of motivation in ParkinsonÃÂs disease with implanted adaptive brain stimulation,10106490,K23NS120037,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Craniocerebral Trauma', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Ganglia', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Implant', 'Impulsivity', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Assessment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'addiction', 'affective neuroscience', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'motivated behavior', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward circuitry', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trial design']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,200478
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,10187663,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,75097
"DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most effective treatments for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Delivery of high frequency electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) ameliorates parkinsonian motor symptoms, often within seconds, but therapeutic effects wear off quickly if stimulation is stopped, often within minutes. This transient nature of symptomatic relief underscores the fact that existing DBS protocols mask symptoms but do not alleviate underlying circuit dysfunction. A modified DBS protocol, called coordinated reset (CR-DBS), has shown potential to provide long-lasting therapeutic benefits for days to weeks after stimulation, but this protocol has been slow to translate into widespread clinical use because (1) the multi- site, pseudorandom stimulation patterns required to implement it cannot be delivered with existing devices and (2) its mechanisms of action remain obscure, hindering insights into what parameters of CR-DBS should be tuned to ensure engagement of long-lasting effects. Recently, in a mouse model of PD, we discovered a cellular- based strategy to induce long-lasting motor recovery, by using optogenetics to target interventions to specific neuronal subpopulations in the external globus pallidus (GPe), an anatomical neighbor of the STN. Long-lasting motor rescue was induced by interventions that simultaneously increased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in parvalbumin (PV-GPe) and decreased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6-GPe). Interestingly, at the physiological level, these cell-type specific interventions in the GPe converged upon a similar mechanism as CR-DBS, by ameliorating pathological patterns of neural activity in basal ganglia output nuclei that have been associated with parkinsonian motor deficits. This proposal will use knowledge gained from our discovery of long-lasting rescue through cell-type directed interventions in GPe to guide rational design and interrogation of human-applicable forms of DBS that may yield similarly long-lasting therapeutic benefit. Our experiments will test a novel, mechanistic hypothesis, based on supporting preliminary data, that the pattern of electrical DBS can be tuned to drive cell-type specific responses in the GPe that mirror those previously found to be sufficient to induce of long-lasting motor rescue with optogenetics. Experiments in Aim 1 will investigate the cellular mechanisms through which phasic stimulation in the STN evokes cell-type specific responses in the GPe (Aim 1.1) and use a machine learning approach to identify stimulation protocols that maximize this cell-type specific response (Aim 1.2). Experiments in Aim 2 will test the therapeutic efficacy of phasic stimulation protocols compared to conventional DBS, using behavioral and physiological assays in mouse (Aim 2.1) and primate (Aim 2.2) models of PD. Taken together, these experiments will advance our understanding of the fundamental differences between how conventional vs. phasic stimulation impacts the nervous system, with cell-type specific and synapse-specific resolution, and could provide novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly translated into humans. Project Narrative Conventional DBS is an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its therapeutic effects decay rapidly once stimulation is turned off, underscoring the fact that it masks symptoms but does not reverse underlying circuit dysfunction. Based on foundational research into the cell-type organization of basal ganglia circuits, this proposal develops and tests the therapeutic efficacy of electrical stimulation protocols designed to selectively recruit therapeutic cell populations within the external globus pallidus (GPe) of the basal ganglia. The collaborative project will test the efficacy and therapeutic duration of novel stimulation protocols in mouse and primate models of PD.",DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease,10145825,R01NS117058,"['Acute', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Homeobox', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Oxidopamine', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'STN stimulation', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Solid', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'motor deficit', 'motor recovery', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'neural patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'translation to humans']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,628368
"Model-based neural control of brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide, with depressive disorders being the most disabling among them. Many patients are resistant to all current treatments. Invasive electrical brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression showed early promise in open-label studies but has had variable efficacy in controlled clinical trials. To date, stimulation in neuropsychiatric disorders has been limited to an open-loop approach that applies a fixed pattern of continuous stimulation regardless of symptom levels. One limitation is that open-loop stimulation does not track the inter- and intra-subject variabilities in neuropsychiatric symptoms, which can change rapidly in an individual. Another limitation is the lack of an input-output model that can guide stimulation by predicting how ongoing stimulation input drives large-scale neural activity and the symptoms it underlies in an individual. We will address these limitations to enable precise invasive electrical brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders by developing a novel real-time model-based neural control system. We will provide proof-of-concept demonstration for acute control of neural biomarkers of mood states related to depression symptoms in epilepsy patients with implanted intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) electrodes, in whom we will obtain repeated mood self-reports and perform stimulation simultaneously with neural recording. The system will continuously adjust the stimulation parameters, for the first time, based on 2 elements: (i) Novel personalized input-output model learned on recorded brain network response while delivering a new stochastic stimulation waveform to excite network activity. (ii) Personalized decoder trained on multi-day continuous iEEG recordings and simultaneous mood self-reports to estimate mood state variations from neural activity as feedback. Combining these, we will build a real-time model-based closed-loop system to precisely drive the neurally-decoded mood state—the neural biomarker of mood—to a target level. Our system generalizes to any stimulation site. Here, we will demonstrate the system with orbitofrontal stimulation as we have shown it to acutely improve mood and modulate large-scale mood-relevant brain activity. We will run real-time closed-loop experiments in each patient. The system will estimate the neural biomarker from iEEG and adjust the stimulation amplitude and frequency in real-time based on the input-output model to drive the estimated biomarker to a target level. We will also develop model-free closed-loop on-off stimulation that turns stimulation on-off based on the neural biomarker. We will compare model-based, on-off and open-loop stimulations. Success of this program will enable precisely regulating a desired brain state by developing the first model-based closed- loop invasive brain stimulation system and advancing neuromodulation technology. It will also directly inform electrical stimulation therapy in future pivotal clinical trials of refractory depression. The developed system and gained knowledge will generalize across many neuropsychiatric disorders with broad public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Direct electrical stimulation of the brain holds promise for patients with refractory neuropsychiatric conditions and in particular treatment-resistant depression but has been limited to delivering a fixed stimulation pattern and shown variable efficacy in clinical trials. We propose that one way to improve efficacy is to build a novel model- based system that adjusts the stimulation based on recording brain signals that are related to mood symptoms and modeling how ongoing stimulation changes these signals. We will develop this novel model-based system to enable personalized real-time stimulation and test it for acute control of neural biomarkers of mood states related to depression symptoms in human epilepsy patients.",Model-based neural control of brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders,10209839,R01MH123770,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Trials', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Dissociation', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electric Stimulation Therapy', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Refractory', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'comorbid depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'mind control', 'mood symptom', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open label', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time model', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,626990
"Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models ABSTRACT  Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer's disease), afflicting tens of millions worldwide. The characteristic disease symptoms arise from basal ganglia dysfunction that occurs secondary to loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Symptomatic treatment is focused either on replacing dopamine or disrupting aberrant activity through deep- brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus or the primary basal ganglia output nucleus in the primate, internal globus pallidus (GPi). This proposal is aimed at understanding the function and dysfunction of basal ganglia circuitry in mice, at the output of the basal ganglia to motor thalamus. In Aim 1, we will develop strategies to identify basal ganglia-recipient motor thalamus neurons in ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamus (VA/VL), and characterize their projection targets and cortical inputs in awake, behaving animals. In Aim 2, we will use sophisticated in vivo strategies to record from posterior EP neurons and VA/VL neurons as animals move their limbs during locomotion, a fixed repetitive behavior. We will perturb activity in this pathway using optogenetics to determine the contribution of activity in these neurons to forelimb movements, and we will examine how activity in this pathway is altered after loss of striatal dopamine. In Aim 3, we will perform similar experiments in mice performing a lever-pulling task, a flexible forelimb movement. We will examine both cued and uncued versions of this task to distinguish activity generated internally vs. externally. Finally, we will examine how loss of striatal dopamine impacts EP and VA/VL activity during flexible forelimb movements. Our overarching goal is to understand how loss of striatal dopamine in PD leads to disruptions in basal ganglia circuit function and motor deficits, in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating PD motor symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) results from a progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, most of which innervate the basal ganglia. Here, we propose to study the effects of dopamine loss in mice, focusing on the function of the entopeduncular nucleus (a rodent equivalent of the internal globus pallidus, major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and a site of deep brain stimulation in PD) and the ventral motor thalamus. Remarkably, the function of these regions remains mysterious, yet they hold great promise for understanding PD and developing new therapeutic strategies for treating PD symptoms.",Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models,10093142,R01NS064984,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Axon', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dopamine', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Eye Movements', 'Forelimb', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homologous Gene', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Subthalamic structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'awake', 'base', 'body position', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'density', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'endopeduncular nucleus', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'parkinsonian rodent', 'pars compacta', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NINDS,J.

"Spinal Neurons that shape the way we move: diversity supplement for Ms. Gonzalez Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function. Project Narrative Our movements are shaped by sensory information, and though much progress has been made in understanding how proprioceptors (muscle sensory neurons) shape motor function, much less is known about how touch receptors (skin sensory neurons) influence motor pathways.

"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles. This effort will contribute to the restoration of voluntary limb movements in individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke.",Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation,10118234,R01NS102259,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Digit structure', 'Elbow', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Forearm', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Joints', 'Lifting', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fatigue', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Space', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Quadriplegia', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experience', 'finger movement', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'grasp', 'hand grasp', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'neuroprosthesis', 'nonhuman primate', 'response', 'restoration', 'robotic device', 'scapula']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,274263
"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,10149422,R01NS107328,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Glean', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson&apos', 's Disease Rating Scale', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Theory', 'Work', 'base', 'disease heterogeneity', 'dopamine transporter', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'neuron loss', 'presynaptic', 'progression marker', 'putamen', 'research clinical testing', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'uptake']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352779
