"Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic PROJECT SUMMARY Up-to-date information about non-fatal overdose emergency department (ED) encounters can provide critical information about the evolution of the opioid epidemic and response of the healthcare system and is an essential to planning of clinical trials to address the problems underlying this epidemic. Establishing a platform that delivers high positive predictive value for opioid-related overdose (OD) using a combination of coded and natural language terms in electronic health records (EHRs) is an essential step toward the large-scale surveillance necessary to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of numerous systemic and policy-based efforts and to create the infrastructure for large scale trials to reduce drug-related mortality and morbidity. However, to date, localized and federal efforts have been largely based on discrete ICD-10 code data or have had time lags of one-to-three years for more detailed data. Perhaps more Importantly, they have not had the capacity for planning and feasibility assessment for clinical and translational research at specific sites. We propose foundational work to create an inter-institutional research database and network focused on patients presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD. To create this network, we will extend previous work to develop: (1) an e-phenotype for case identification in the ED based on EHR data, and (2) combine this with a data dictionary and coded data extraction tools, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, to obtain additional data from EHRs; tools for primary capture of data during clinical care; and tools for integration of data on social determinants of health. This will allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD including: demographics, comorbidities, OD agent and source, intentionality of the OD, ED treatment and discharge disposition. Through refinement and automation, the data extraction process will be extended to a set of pilot CTSA Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network sites and then potentially to other CTSA's nation-wide. This new functionality focuses on providing a platform to accelerate research. To accomplish this work, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ACT Network data model and infrastructure to monitor the opioid epidemic using ED data, 2) Create a prototype opioid overdose monitoring and response network across participating institutions and a toolkit for other CTSA sites to join the network, and 3) Demonstrate potential usefulness of the network in monitoring the opioid epidemic and in planning clinical trials. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective near real time means of monitoring opioid-related OD presentation in EDs across the country to inform point-of-care service delivery, prevention and treatment intervention development and evaluation. Downstream, the application of project deliverables include dissemination of the replication toolkit to leverage the platform of the CTSAs and NIDA Clinical Trials Network to build capacity for timely surveillance of opioid-related OD to facilitate prevention and treatment research and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients presenting with opioid-related overdose to hospital emergency departments represent a high-risk group for morbidity and mortality and a potential target for interventions to combat the opioid epidemic. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective inter-institutional research database and network focused on these patients. These tools will inform point-of-care service delivery, as well as enhance nationwide prevention and treatment interventions.",Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic,10198067,U01TR002628,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'California', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fentanyl', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Resources', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heroin', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investments', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratories', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Prescription Drugs', 'Odds Ratio', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome Study', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Research', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Site', 'Source', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical infrastructure', 'combat', 'comorbidity', 'data dictionary', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data tools', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'fitness', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose prevention', 'point of care', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prototype', 'response', 'service delivery', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'synthetic opioid', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational study', 'treatment research']",NCATS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,U01,2021,724111
"Understanding the role of community determinants in opioid use disorder and program implementation factors influencing patient adherence to opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  To inform an effective response to the opioid epidemic, understanding the multilevel factors that influence risk of opioid use disorder (OUD) is critical. In addition, although the efficacy of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD is proven, long-term retention in treatment has been a challenge. Thus, efforts are needed to identify program implementation factors that can be strengthened to improve OUD treatment outcomes. The K01 Award will provide the candidate the requisite skills and mentored research experience necessary to meet her long-term goal of conducting independent, innovative research on OUD and its treatment that can guide strategic investment to prevent OUD and inform implementation of MAT programs to increase patient adherence. This proposal comprises a 5-year plan that includes mentorship by Wade Berrettini, MD, PhD, Brian Schwartz, MD, MS, H. Lester Kirchner, PhD, MS, Danielle Mowery, PhD, MS, and Alanna Kulchak Rahm, PhD, MS; didactic training activities to meet the candidate's training goals; and conduct of a two-phase research project that will provide the candidate with substantive experience leading epidemiologic research using electronic health record (EHR) data and in implementation science. The proposed research will be conducted at Geisinger, an integrated healthcare system serving a large geographically diverse region of Pennsylvania, leveraging its research assets—including a wealth of health-related EHR data and linked genetic data—and the ability to integrate research into the clinical environment. The aims of the research are twofold. Aim 1 centers on the social determinants that engender vulnerability to OUD, evaluating associations of community contextual factors related to socioeconomic, social, and physical conditions with OUD, and the role individual-level genetic risk factors, healthcare factors, and comorbid medical conditions play in these relations. Aim 1 will utilize EHR and genetic data from Geisinger patients (n = 18,728) coupled with secondary data characterizing community factors to conduct a nested case-control study. Aim 2 seeks to understand program implementation factors that impact patient adherence to MAT for OUD. Aim 2 is a mixed methods study that will involve interviews with key informants (n ≈ 30) to identify multilevel barriers and facilitators influencing MAT success, followed by a survey of adult patients (n = 500) in Geisinger's MAT clinics to quantify factors influencing MAT adherence from a patient perspective. Completion of this research will fulfill the candidate's short-term goals by providing training in: (1) OUD, its treatment, and substance use disorder research; (2) natural language processing; (3) measurement of contextual factors; (4) statistical analysis including multilevel modeling and mediation analysis; (5) gene-environment interaction research; and (6) implementation science. The proposed research will generate evidence to understand novel, understudied risk factors for OUD, with implications for investment in community-level prevention interventions, and how health systems can improve treatment retention among individuals with OUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research will elucidate how community contextual factors related to economic, social, and physical conditions work in conjunction with individual-level genetic risk factors, healthcare factors, and comorbid medical conditions in generating or mitigating risk for opioid use disorder. It will also identify program implementation factors at the individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels that influence adherence to medication-assisted treatment among patients with opioid use disorder. The research results will inform investment in preventive interventions where community conditions may increase risk for opioid use disorder as well as how health systems can increase retention in treatment programs for opioid use disorder.",Understanding the role of community determinants in opioid use disorder and program implementation factors influencing patient adherence to opioid agonist therapy,10202540,K01DA049903,"['Abate', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adult', 'Buprenorphine', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dropout', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'PF4 Gene', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Qualitative Research', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biobank', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'case control', 'community intervention', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'contextual factors', 'deprivation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'health data', 'illicit opioid', 'implementation determinants', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid treatment program', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'rural counties', 'scale up', 'skills', 'social', 'social cohesion', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment program']",NIDA,GEISINGER CLINIC,K01,2021,162032
"Digital Therapeutic Development of Virtual Cognitive-Affective Training for Opioid Use Disorder Project Summary: The US is experiencing an opioid crisis, with an estimated 2.5 million Americans meeting full criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for OUD. In spite of the proven efficacy of MOUD, nearly half of people who begin a MOUD relapse within six months. As such, novel and efficacious behavioral adjuncts to MOUD are needed to improve treatment outcomes. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a cognitive-affective training intervention generated through a NIDA-funded treatment development process has shown significant promise, demonstrating therapeutic effects in four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by reducing opioid use and misuse and modulating neurophysiological responses during drug cue-reactivity and natural reward processing. However, the MORE intervention requires significant human interaction and is therefore resource intensive. Further, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with OUD may be reticent to engage in face-to-face interventions due to the risk of viral spread. To overcome these implementation barriers and increase access to treatment, the proposed project will develop and test a virtual reality version of the MORE intervention (MORE-VR) built on BehaVR LLC's VR existing, commercially available platform, the Dynamic eXperience Engine (DXE). The DXE uses machine learning to integrate biometrics into the VR experience to personalize addictions treatment, boosting patient engagement and optimizing the efficacy of clinical intervention. In Phase I, we will develop and test the MORE-VR prototype in a single arm clinical study of OUD patients receiving buprenorphine in an opioid treatment program (OTP), focusing on patient safety and engagement. If the prototype is perceived to have adequate usability and Net Promoter Scores, as well as to produce improvements in proximal measures of craving and affective state, the project will progress to Phase II. In Phase II, we will first develop the MORE-VR Minimal Viable Program using feedback from our Phase I study to optimize the intervention, and then conduct a RCT of MORE-VR vs. MOUD treatment as usual. Our robust and unbiased research design will triangulate clinical outcome measurement with biochemical verification of abstinence, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), and neurophysiological assessment of cue-reactivity. Further, we will integrate the MORE-VR Program into the OTP operational environment, building Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources interfaces to ingest patient data from electronic medical records (EMRs) and to export patient utilization, assessment, and biometric data back to EMRs to create patient records and inform clinicians of patient progress. Activities in Phase I and Phase II will help define the regulatory pathway and establish regulatory feasibility to precede Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the MORE-VR system as a Class II medical device. In sum, this project will translate an evidence- based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD. Project Narrative Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for opioid use disorder (OUD); however, novel behavioral adjuncts are needed to remediate dysregulation in brain reward systems, enhance MOUD adherence, and prevent relapse. BehaVR, LLC will meet this need by translating an evidence-based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD that will increase accessibility to services to improve the patient's chances of long-term treatment success.",Digital Therapeutic Development of Virtual Cognitive-Affective Training for Opioid Use Disorder,10255561,R44DA053848,"['Abstinence', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teleconferences', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Viral', 'addiction', 'affective neuroscience', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'biobehavior', 'chronic pain', 'clinical efficacy', 'commercialization', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'design', 'digital treatment', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation barriers', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mindfulness', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid treatment program', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'patient safety', 'phase 1 study', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'response', 'reward processing', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment program', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'virtual', 'virtual machine', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality system']",NIDA,"BEHAVR, LLC",R44,2021,319021
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,10152467,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'physically handicapped', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,913112

"Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media 2/12/2019 ProjectSummary - Google Docs Project Summary I will leverage social media conversations, specifically Reddit, to examine treatment help-seeking at an unprecedented scale, thereby collecting evidence “in the wild” as a new strategy to monitor and respond to the opioid crisis through the following aims. Aim 1. Data Driven Characterization of Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users: I will systematically identify Reddit posts about opioids, identify if the post is help-seeking for treatment, and contextualize the content of help-seeking posts. Aim 2. Data Driven Characterization of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to understand how peers organically respond to help-seeking for treatment by building data-driven models to discern what attributes of posts are predictive of receiving a response from a peer and to examine the typical content and reciprocity of responses. Aim 3. Assess the Quality of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to identify the types of treatment, treatment services, and treatment referral services that are provided in the responses and assess the quality of lay responses to opioid treatment help-seeking. Currently, little is known about how drug users engage social media to support or combat their addictions. Reddit is the sixth most popular website in the US with many reporters noting that it may be the last lifeline for opioid users. Yet, little has been done to tap this potential source for social media monitoring, especially given the difficulty of finding self-identified opioid users who are already contemplating strategies to treat their addiction. This study adds a new significant perspective to social media monitoring and will be among the first in public health to consider social media conversation threads by assessing unique posts about opioid help-seeking, the responses these posts get, and the quality of responses to addiction help-seeking, thereby creating a knowledge base for public health leaders to respond. Success of these aims will generate a number of future research directions that will support interventions that address the needs of self-identified opioid users seeking help on Reddit. Moreover, within all three aims this study will bring significant methodological advances to the study of social media around substance use with the aims relying heavily on automated approaches and analysis first developed in the computational sciences engendering more data scientists to join public health to create actionable knowledge. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4XHd63xhPZT8OFf9bHQ2q6XHpYp_c4AbouAOtAC3SU/edit 1/1 2/12/2019 ProjectNarrative - Google Docs Project Narrative An explosion of surveillance tools fueled by big media data (including social media) is changing public health. These data reveal what a person is thinking/doing and when they are thinking/doing it based on the content and timing of their public posts, providing an assessment of organic help-seeking for addiction and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing that was never before possible. I will extract actionable intelligence from social media data, specifically Reddit, to support more agile, responsive opioid intervention research by studying (a) treatment help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, (b) lay responses to help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, and (c) whether lay peers link self-identified opioid users to evidence-based treatment, treatment services, or treatment referral services. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RyIXTdDAbFSkCe81q6hThDiZzKGCXkCy8npWgzr5wfM/edit 1/1",Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media,10137210,K25DA049944,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Code', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Drug user', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Hotlines', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Public Assistance', 'Public Health', 'RQ2', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Social intelligence', 'Source', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'combat', 'dissemination trial', 'evidence base', 'help-seeking behavior', 'illicit opioid', 'knowledge base', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'opioid user', 'opioid withdrawal', 'peer', 'phrases', 'posters', 'prescription opioid', 'public health intervention', 'referral services', 'research study', 'response', 'social media', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K25,2021,189498
"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids.

"Unraveling the Locus Coeruleus Circuitry in Opioidinduced Sleep Disturbances PROJECT SUMMARY The main goals of this training proposal is 1) to provide Li Li, MD, PhD, a practicing anesthesiologist at the University of Washington, with additional scientific and professional skills to facilitate his transition to become an independent investigator, and 2) to better understand how the locus coeruleus (LC), at the cellular and circuit levels, contributes to opioid-induced sleep disturbances. Studying sleep disturbances caused by opioids is important because opioids have enormous societal impact, causing over 46,000 overdose deaths in 2018 and almost $80 billion in economic cost annually in the United States; and because recent studies have implicated several aspects of sleep disturbances caused by opioids, including poorer cognition, decreased pain tolerance, and increased negative affect, in contributing to chronic opioid use and relapse. Interestingly, the LC and paraventricular thalamus (PVT) are two brain regions that modulate sleep-wake balance and mediate withdrawal behaviors from opioids, but their roles in opioid-induced sleep disturbances are relatively unknown. Thus, during his K99 phase, Dr. Li aims to 1) examine LC neuronal activity in relation to sleep patterns in a mouse model of acute and chronic opioid administration and 2) determine the role of local opioid receptors in the LC in opioid- induced sleep disturbances. Furthermore, he plans to receive training in 1-photon microendoscopic imaging, optogenetic manipulation of opioid receptors, and cell-specific drug targeting using drug acutely restricted by tethering (DART); and will be mentored by Prof. Michael Bruchas, a world-renowned expert in opioid neurobiology, and a committee of experts in neural circuitry analysis, sleep, and substance abuse disorders. Together, his training will help transition to his independent R00 phase, where he plans to use his trained skills 1) to examine PVT neuronal activity in relation to sleep patterns in acute and chronic opioid administration, and to determine role of local opioid receptors in PVT in opioid-induced sleep disturbances. Studies in the independent phase will prepare him for a future R01 submission to further examine arousal neural circuitry response to sedative and anesthetic drugs. Thus, this proposal aims to characterize the LC-PVT circuit in a mouse model of acute and chronic opioid administration using cutting-edge tools in neural circuit analysis and cell-specific pharmacology in order to better understand the cellular and circuit mechanism underlying opioid- induced sleep disturbances, and provides the essential training and mentorship for Dr. Li to help him achieve his career goal of starting his own lab and becoming an independent investigator. PROJECTIVE NARRATIVE Despite the opioid epidemic causing over 46,000 overdose deaths in 2018, opioids remain important drugs for treating acute pain after surgery, and consequently put surgical patients at risk for their myriad of side effects and for chronic opioid use. As recent studies have implicated opioid-induced sleep disturbances as a contributing factor to opioid dependence and relapse, the proposed studies aim to better understand the neurobiological mechanism by which opioids disrupt sleep acutely and chronically. Together, these new findings may offer a new approach in treating those suffering from opioid addiction, and new insights into the role of acute opioid use in sleep disturbances after surgery.",Unraveling the Locus Coeruleus Circuitry in Opioidinduced Sleep Disturbances,10187134,K99DA053336,"['Acute', 'Acute Pain', 'Anesthetics', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Equilibrium', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morphine', 'Mus', 'Naloxone', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neuropharmacology', 'Norepinephrine', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Oxymorphone', 'Pain Threshold', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photometry', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Receptor Cell', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saline', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Source', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Virus', 'Washington', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'calcium indicator', 'career', 'cell type', 'conditional knockout', 'dependence relapse', 'economic cost', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'morphine administration', 'mouse model', 'mu opioid receptors', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'optogenetics', 'overdose death', 'receptor expression', 'receptor function', 'response', 'sedative', 'sensor', 'side effect', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sleep pattern', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2021,175014
"Developing and Evaluating a Machine-Learning Opioid Prediction & Risk-Stratification E-Platform (DEMONSTRATE) Project Summary/Abstract An unprecedented rise in opioid overdose and opioid use disorder (OUD) has become a public health crisis in the US. In response, health systems, payers, and policy makers have developed or adopted measures and programs to target individuals at high-risk for overdose or OUD. However, significant gaps exist in the current approaches to identify individuals at high-risk for overdose or OUD. First, the definition of ‘high-risk’ currently used by payers and health systems varies widely (ranging from high opioid dose to the number of pharmacies or prescribers a patient has visited). Second, little is known about how accurately these measures truly identify patients with overdose or OUD, and there is some evidence showing they perform poorly, missing 70% to 90% of individuals with an actual OUD diagnosis or overdose. Third, our NIDA-funded work (R01DA044985) using national Medicare and Pennsylvania Medicaid claims data has shown that machine-learning algorithms can achieve better performance for risk prediction for opioid overdose and OUD. Thus, the immediate next step is to expand our algorithms to other data sources (e.g., electronic health records [EHR]), as well as to apply state-of- the-art longitudinal neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) to further improve prediction accuracy. In addition, we aim to translate these risk scores into a clinical decision tool to be used by health care systems to automatically analyze and visualize the relevant information regarding risk prediction and stratification for opioid overdose or OUD, using either claims data, EHR data, or both in real time. Leveraging our NIDA-funded work on developing machine-learning algorithms to predict opioid overdose and OUD, we propose to “develop and evaluate a machine-learning opioid prediction & risk-stratification e- platform (DEMONSTRATE)” that can be used by health care systems to identify patients at high risk for opioid overdose and OUD. We have 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will refine and validate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk for opioid overdose/OUD using 3 different datasets (i.e., 2011-2020 Florida all-payer EHR, Florida Medicaid claims, and Florida Medicaid claims linked with EHR data) from the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium. We will expand our current algorithms by applying state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NLP) to improve prediction. In Aim 2, we will design and prototype a DEMONSTRATE clinical decision support tool to incorporate the best prediction algorithms to provide automatic warnings to primary care providers of patients at high risk of overdose/OUD. An iterative user-centered design approach will be used to enhance DEMONSTRATE’s functionality and usability. In Aim 3, we will integrate DEMONSTRATE into the University of Florida Health’s EHR system, and deploy and pilot test DEMONSTRATE in three primary care clinics. We will assess DEMONSTRATE’s usability, acceptability, and feasibility. Our proposed research is highly innovative in its expansion, translation, and application of a promising NIDA-funded machine-learning opioid prediction and risk stratification tool into a software platform to better inform clinical practice for improving safety of opioid use. NARRATIVES The proposed study aims to harness advanced natural language processing and longitudinal neural network approaches to build on our previously developed machine-learning prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk for opioid overdose or opioid use disorder. We will develop the prediction tool using all-payer electronic health records (EHR), Medicaid claims, and Medicaid claims linked with EHR data from the One Florida Clinical Research Consortium and translate the risk prediction algorithms into a clinical decision support platform integrated into the EHR system to identify patients at high risk of overdose and opioid use disorder. This innovative and integrated platform will better guide clinical providers and health care systems for improving safety of opioid prescribing in clinical practice, and prevent opioid-associated adverse outcomes.",Developing and Evaluating a Machine-Learning Opioid Prediction & Risk-Stratification E-Platform (DEMONSTRATE),10119030,R01DA050676,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physician Assistants', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Social Behavior', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'high risk', 'implementation outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'neural network', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel strategies', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk mitigation', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'structured data', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,701725
"HEAL Diversity Supplement: Great Lakes Nodes Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract We assess the feasibility of mobile technologies to study the psychophysiological underpinnings of affect in Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). In this feasibility pilot study, we will evaluate participants’ adherence to the procedures of a longitudinal study, including: 1. wearing wearable sensors for the duration of the study, 2. completing research activities involving prompted and self-initiated self-reports on momentary experiences of stress and negative affect. We will also examine the validity and reliability of the physiological data captured with two wearable sensors from two different brands and that are placed in different body locations. It is important to assess the reliability of data from two devices simultaneously to examine issues that may hinder a study’s viability, like data noise, signal problems, or data loss, etc. Lastly, we will utilize this data to investigate the role of autonomic function as a valid physiological marker of stress and negative affect in OUD. This has relevant implications in the understanding and development of digital treatments, as stress and negative affect are major contributors of relapse. This pilot work will contribute to the aim 2 of the parent grant by using digital and computational health cores to advance research in mHealth, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In addition, the work supported under this supplement will serve as a building block to successfully create and submit an F31 grant proposal, a research that will be carried out following the diversity supplement period. This supplement will support the intensive training and invaluable practical experience that will advance the career of the trainee, Veronica Ramirez. This is in alignment with aim 6 of the parent grant to “expand the pipeline for early investigators” and create programs that support “addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship”. Aligned with this, our research can ultimately help current efforts to address the opioid epidemic to ameliorate its detrimental effects on society. Project Narrative This proposal aims to address the complex problem of addiction and the opioid epidemic. This is important due to the cascade of negative impacts on society. Understanding the psychophysiological factors that interact with disrupted neurobiological systems resulting in increased negative affect could clarify drug addiction trajectories and apply this knowledge to the development of digital therapeutics in mHealth.",HEAL Diversity Supplement: Great Lakes Nodes Clinical Trials Network,10354615,UG1DA049467,"['Abstinence', 'Academia', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Faculty', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysiology', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Veronica', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Writing', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'career', 'digital', 'digital mental health', 'digital treatment', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'implementation science', 'indexing', 'mHealth', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'new technology', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use disorder', 'parent grant', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'stress reactivity', 'substance misuse', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2021,70982
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,10164748,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data repository', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'substance use treatment', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2021,203040
"Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis PROJECT SUMMARY  The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder, which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providers’ perceptions. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records, corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3) machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Opioid use disorder is a key driver of the U.S. opioid overdose crisis, yet treatment remains both underused and unequal. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying modifiable structural predictors of treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder. The results of this project are expected to inform multilevel interventions equitably deliver treatment for opioid use disorder, ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders, and reduce health disparities.",Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis,10190881,K99DA051534,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'African American', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Veterans', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Visit', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caucasian American', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'novel strategies', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial disparity', 'skills', 'social', 'standard of care', 'substance use treatment', 'success', 'treatment disparity']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,179582
"Clear Volume Imaging with Machine Learning: a novel tool to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse in rat models This project is in response to PA-18-437 “Cutting-Edge Basic Research Awards (CEBRA)”. Over the two past decades, there has been a large increase in the abuse of prescription and illegal opioids; this increase coincides with increases in opioid-related deaths. A critical challenge is the occurrence of relapse in treated patients, especially given that relapse episodes carry a risk of overdose. There is a need to improve our understanding of the brain mechanisms of opioid relapse, which hopefully will result in the identification of targeted circuitry-based treatments. We propose to develop a high-throughput computation system termed Clear Volume Analysis with Machine Learning (CVA-ML). We will combine CVA-ML with a rat-optimized version of the whole brain immunostaining and clearing method iDISCO+ and a new rat model of opioid relapse after voluntary abstinence to identify brain- wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse. We recently adapted the iDISCO+ method to intact rat brains and developed experimental methods for Fos immunostaining, brain clearing, and light sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging. However, incorporation of the iDISCO+ method to large scale rat studies is currently limited by (1) lack of ABA-CCF-comparable high-resolution 3D rat brain atlas that allows for high-resolution registration of the activity signal in the 3D space, and (2) lack of an automated data analysis pipeline. In Aim 1, we propose to develop a data analysis pipeline that will take light sheet fluorescence microscopy- generated rat brain images and automatically register them into a custom-made 3D rat brain atlas encompassing a converted Paxinos and Watson rat’s brain atlas. As part of Aim 1, we also propose to develop machine-learning methods to identify and analyze the whole brain Fos signals in 3D space. In Aim 2, we propose to use the methods we developed in Aim 1 to identify brain-wide patterns of neuronal activity (‘neural ensembles’) that encode opioid relapse after voluntary abstinence induced by imposing adverse consequences (electric barrier) that results in long-term cessation of opioid (oxycodone) self-administration. Our proposal addresses the goal of PA-18-437: “to develop, and/or adapt, revolutionary techniques or methods for addiction research.” The anticipated outcomes of our proposal are an open-source software package to automatically analyze iDISCO+ data of rat brains, and a rat whole brain activity map for opioid relapse, assessed using a new rat model. The publicly available software will be easy to modify and can be used by investigators to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles underlying drug relapse and other motivated behaviors in rats. Project Narrative This project seeks to develop a high-throughput computation system and combine it with the whole brain clearing method iDisco+ and a novel rat model of relapse after voluntary abstinence opioid relapse model to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse.

"Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130 Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths and relapses.","Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment.",10339121,R43DA050399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Maintenance', 'Methadone', 'Monitor', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid Rotation', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'methadone treatment', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose death', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'supervised learning', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"OPIAID, LLC",R43,2021,55000
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,10098312,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'comparison intervention', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,552775
"iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY The integrated research and training plans outlined in this K23 submission will prepare me for a career as a clinician-scientist conducting translational substance abuse research. My career goal is to perform hypothesis- driven original research investigations directed toward reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose. In this proposal, I intend to deploy wearable biosensors (small devices that continuously record physiology) to study the effects of therapeutic administration of opioid analgesics. I have already studied wearable biosensors in individuals receiving opioids; my preliminary data demonstrates that opioid-tolerant individuals have different biometric signals than non-tolerant individuals. This observation suggests that biosensors can be used to identify the onset of tolerance, an important event that correlates with higher doses of opioid analgesics, and higher risk of death from opioid overdose. Biosensor data management and analysis requires signal processing, data analytic, and machine learning techniques; these approaches are beyond the areas of traditional medical training. My short-term goal is to utilize this K23 award to fill my knowledge gaps in wearable biosensing and advanced data analysis so that I can generate ever more innovative responses to the problem of opioid prescribing, tolerance, misuse, addiction, and overdose. To optimize this important line of investigation, I have developed a training plan that includes: 1) completing a PhD through the Millennium PhD program; 2) expanding my skills in wearable biosensing and behavioral health-based research; 3) developing an understanding of signal processing and machine learning; 4) developing data analytic and data science skills; and 5) expanding my research presentation and dissemination skills. I will achieve these goals through directed coursework, focused seminars, and practical experience. My mentorship team of expert investigators who will ensure my productivity and success includes E. Boyer (primary mentor), D. Smelson, J. Fang, and P. Indic (secondary mentors), and D. Ganesan (advisor) My research plan has three specific aims: 1) to deploy a wearable biosensor technology to detect digital biomarkers associated with the initiation of opioid analgesic therapy in an opioid naïve population; 2) to use signal-processing analytics to identify transitions in digital biomarkers with progressive opioid use and to identify individual characteristics associated with this transition; and, 3) to apply and explore supervised learning algorithms that can predict transitions in digital biomarkers that herald the onset of opioid tolerance. To identify dynamic patterns in response to opioids, I will study the digital biomarkers of opioid-naïve patients with acute fractures who are prescribed opioid analgesics. Results will be used to develop “big data” approaches to apply predictive algorithms to identify the onset of opioid tolerance. This work has the potential to prevent development of problematic opioid use and will provide the basis for subsequent R01 submissions to implement sensor-based interventions triggered by the onset of tolerance in individuals receiving opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to opioids (both prescription and illicit) has reached staggering proportions: more than half of individuals who currently abuse heroin report that opioid abuse began with a prescription opioid. Dr. Carreiro has demonstrated that wearable biosensors can discriminate between individuals who are naïve to the effects of opioids from those who are opioid tolerant, a characteristic that increases risk for opioid-related death. This career development award will provide her with the training to use of wearable biosensors to identify the onset of opioid tolerance and the expertise to reach her ultimate goal of developing tools to prevent opioid-related death and increase the safety of opioid prescribing.",iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals,10118152,K23DA045242,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug abuse', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heroin Abuse', 'Immersion', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'career', 'comparative', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'digital', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2021,188616
"Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history and new approaches are needed. One novel approach includes predicting likelihood of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment retention by assessing someone’s risk of early departure from treatment. Current methods to improve treatment retention rely on providers using their intuition to identify when an individual is at risk of leaving treatment early in order to intervene, which often happens too late. Mobile health and machine learning predictive analytics offer a new opportunity to personalize OUD treatment, improve retention in OUD care, and mitigate the risk of relapse and overdose episodes. Project Motivate will combine physiological and behavioral data from disparate sources in order to predict when an individual is at risk of early departure from OUD treatment. This data will be displayed in a user-friendly manner so that providers can more effectively support patients to remain in treatment with timely intervention and responses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early departure from opioid use disorder treatment programs is common, with early termination rates over 50% for many opioid use disorder treatments, putting individuals at an increased risk of relapsing, overdose and death. Using physiological monitoring tools to predict the likelihood that someone is at risk of early departure from opioid use disorder treatment due to worsening symptoms and/or cravings will allow for proactive interventions that will improve treatment retention. Making an impact here will not only save lives, but it will also lower medical costs, municipal emergency response costs, recidivism, workplace accidents, lost workplace productivity and costs to families.",Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder,10339079,R43DA051279,"['Accidents', 'American', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Data', 'Early treatment', 'Emergency response', 'Epidemic', 'Family', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Municipalities', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Workplace', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'novel strategies', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'recidivism', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"BIOMOTIVATE, LLC",R43,2021,55000
"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder.

"Opioid Support and Risk Reduction Online Platform Project Summary  This proposal seeks to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of developing an online support and risk reduction platform to prevent opioid misuse and abuse. This is an urgent area of research; opioid misuse/abuse has reached epidemic proportions in recent years. It is linked to causing the largest drug epidemic in the history of the United States and has become the top priority of the US Surgeon General. Because the opioid crisis (including heroin use) is believed to have largely originated from chronic pain patients' opioid prescriptions, this application will initially focus on the needs of chronic pain patients on opioids who are high risk for addiction and overdose. Later versions of the technology will expand to the broader population of people affected by the opioid crisis, including heroin users.  Although low cost, novel interventions are needed to reduce opioid misuse and abuse, before they lead to addiction and fatal overdose, only 6 behavioral (non-pharmacological) randomized controlled trials have been successfully conducted in this area to date (with our group having conducted one of them), creating a tremendous need for solutions to the opioid crisis. Building off extensive preliminary research that our team conducted, including piloting technology-based behavior change interventions among chronic pain patients, and developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models of opioid outcomes, we propose to design and test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an online peer social support and clinical counseling community to reduce opioid misuse/abuse among chronic pain sufferers.  This is a highly innovative product with scalable commercialization potential and impact as 1) no software platform exists that has been shown to reduce opioid misuse/abuse risk factors, 2) it is evidenced- based, supported by more than a decade of scientific research conducted by our team, and 3) is highly accessible, helping to address the time, cost, and stigma that are constant barriers to opioid prevention and treatment.  Our team includes the former CFO of Epic Systems (and two-time successful entrepreneur), the Associate Chief Medical Information Officer for Cedars-Sinai, a patent attorney at a large Silicon Valley intellectual property firm specializing in digital health portfolios, as well as clinical, data science/statistical, and research experts who conducted more than a decade of formative research leading up to this application. Funding for this Phase 1 SBIR is needed before scaling development and testing more widely among potential health system and insurer customers.

"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets.

"Multivariate Modeling of the Neural Mechanisms of Treatment Response in Opioid Addiction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed K01 project will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and machine learning (ML) to elucidate the neurocognitive processes underlying treatment failure in young adults with opioid use disorder (OUD). Young adults are at particularly high risk of OUD and fatal opioid overdose. The monthly injectable extended-release opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a highly effective OUD treatment and is particularly well suited for young adults. However, XR-NTX adherence and relapse show considerable individual variability, and the behavioral and clinical factors associated with such variability remain inconclusive. Previous research has demonstrated the potential for multimodal MRI and ML techniques to elucidate the neurocognitive factors that contribute to treatment response beyond behavioral and clinical measures. This project will take advantage of the cutting-edge MRI and ML methods to model brain structures and functions that predict XR-NTX treatment outcomes in young adults with OUD. The study will evaluate 18–34 year-old OUD patients before and during the first three months of XR-NTX treatment, a period associated with the highest rate of dropout from treatment. The primary outcome will be opioid relapse confirmed by weekly urine toxicology and self-report. The secondary outcome will be non-adherence defined as failure to complete the first three injections. The study will focus on five baseline measures of brain structures and functions that are potentially predictive of treatment response: 1) grey matter volume; 2) functional connectivity with the ventral striatum; 3) reactivity to opioid cues; 4) inhibitory control; and 5) self-evaluation. ML techniques will be used to reveal the patterns of brain structures/functions that are associated with each outcome variable. Based on literature and preliminary findings, we anticipate that combining MRI with behavioral and clinical assessments will better account for individual variability in XR-NTX treatment outcomes in young adults with OUD, than using the behavioral and clinical variables alone. The data will unveil novel brain mechanisms that contribute to the risk of treatment failure in this critical population. The project will also serve as a training vehicle for Dr. Zhenhao Shi to improve his clinical and computational skills and facilitate his independent career development. Specifically, it will enable Dr. Shi to achieve five training goals: 1) to advance his knowledge in the methodology of clinical research; 2) to gain hands-on experience in leading clinical projects; 3) to master ML and multivariate methodologies; 4) to apply multimodal MRI techniques to translational and clinical research; and 5) to advance his general independent research skills including leadership, networking, collaboration, scientific writing and grantsmanship. Through a combination of didactic and hands-on activities, the project will fulfill Dr. Shi's training needs and enable his transition to a successful and independent research career in applying advanced computational approaches to the neuroscience research of substance use disorders and their treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed K01 project will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning techniques to elucidate the structural and functional brain mechanisms underlying treatment failure in young adults receiving treatment with injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid use disorder. This project will unveil the neural mechanisms underlying individual variability in XR-NTX treatment response in a population of high importance to the efforts to curb the opioid crisis. It will facilitate Dr. Zhenhao Shi's transition to an independent computational addiction neuroscientist and help inform future research of, and intervention strategies for, opioid addiction.",Multivariate Modeling of the Neural Mechanisms of Treatment Response in Opioid Addiction,10214440,K01DA051709,"['Abstinence', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Endocrine', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'ROC Curve', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Self-Examination', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'young adult']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2021,179874
