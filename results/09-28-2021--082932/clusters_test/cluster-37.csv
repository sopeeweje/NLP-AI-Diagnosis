"Neural Mechanisms and Developmental Trajectories of ASD and ADHD Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common neurodevelopmental disorders which exhibit enormous variability in their developmental trajectories. ASD and ADHD also frequently co-occur, such that ASD is associated with elevated ADHD symptoms and vice versa. Notably, such co-occurring ASD and ADHD symptoms are associated with greater impairment, as well as reduced treatment responsiveness. However, the convergent and divergent neural underpinnings of ASD and ADHD remain poorly understood, impeding the personalization of current treatments and the development of more targeted ones. Furthermore, it is not yet possible to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over development. Yet, such predictions could be advantageous for treatment planning. The current project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms underlying ASD and ADHD, as well as our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms may evolve over time. Specifically, this study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the functional and structural properties of the brain in ASD and ADHD by comparing the following groups: ASD, ADHD, comorbid ASD+ADHD, and neurotypical controls. Analyses will be completed in both a lifespan sample (ages 5-65; N>2,700) and a pediatric sample (ages 9-10; N>4,900). Functional connectivity will be calculated from resting-state functional MRI scans, structural connectivity from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans, and structural morphometry measures from T1-weighted structural MRI scans. This multimodal neuroimaging data will also be used with baseline symptom severity to predict trajectories of ASD, ADHD, and internalizing (e.g., anxious, depressive) symptoms between late childhood (ages 9-11) and early adolescence (ages 11-13) in a longitudinal sample (N>700). Ridge regression analyses conducted within each diagnostic group will reveal whether such brain-based information significantly improves predictive ability compared to symptom severity alone. These analyses will be conducted both within groups defined by traditional diagnostic categories and within transdiagnostic brain-based subgroups to determine the potential utility of such subgroups in increasing predictive accuracy; these subtypes will be created using similarity network fusion on subjects’ multimodal neuroimaging data, followed by spectral clustering. As a whole, this project will allow the applicant to receive extensive training in cutting-edge neuroimaging methods, machine learning approaches (ridge regression and spectral clustering), and conducting translational research. Most importantly, findings from this research will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, which may ultimately lead to more tailored treatments. Furthermore, the proposed research may significantly improve our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over time. This could have a direct impact on individual treatment planning, as well as the design and implementation of future treatment studies. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) commonly co-occur and exhibit extraordinarily heterogenous developmental trajectories. This project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, as well as how such brain-based information may improve our ability to predict longitudinal symptom trajectories. This will benefit public health by contributing to the development of more personalized treatments for these disorders, in addition to allowing for improved treatment planning.",Neural Mechanisms and Developmental Trajectories of ASD and ADHD,10290878,F32MH122057,"['11 year old', '13 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adolescent with autism spectrum disorder', 'anxious', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'course development', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'early adolescence', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'inattention', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'personalized medicine', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social cognition', 'symptomatology', 'therapy development', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,F32,2021,68694
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence,10112308,R01MH113550,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Wolves', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'prisma', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'software development', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,715561
"Stratifying the Heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Impact of Co-Occurring Anxiety and ADHD ABSTRACT The substantial heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a key barrier in early diagnosis and in developing and evaluating effective treatments for the disorder. Although early behavioral intervention targeting social, cognitive, and adaptive functioning improves outcomes for many children with ASD, there is significant variability in treatment response within studies. Given this variation, stratifying the heterogeneity of ASD is essential for identifying biomarkers to help providers systematically diagnose, tailor treatment, and monitor response. The proposed project responds to this critical need by elucidating the impact of a potential key source of this heterogeneity: co-occurring anxiety and ADHD. Little is known about the unique and additive impacts of co-occurring anxiety and ADHD on individuals with autism in the early childhood period. Furthermore, the impact of these co-occurring disorders on commonly used neural and behavioral biomarkers remains a gap in the current literature. To fill these gaps in the literature, we propose a multimodal approach, using a combination of parent reports, observational assessments, and neurophysiological assays, to carefully phenotype samples of young children from 4 groups: ASD alone, ASD+Anxiety, ASD+ADHD, and ASD+Anxiety+ADHD. Our central hypothesis is that co-occurring anxiety or ADHD will have both unique and additive effects on the clinical presentation, executive functioning, and biomarker signatures of young children with ASD. To test this hypothesis, we have three aims: (1) Differentiate the impact of co-occurring anxiety or ADHD on core and associated symptoms in young children with ASD. (2) Identify the relationship between co-occurring anxiety or ADHD and executive function deficits in young children with ASD. (3) Determine the relationship between co-occurring anxiety or ADHD and neural, attentional, and behavioral biomarkers being used to characterize and monitor treatments in ASD. If successful, this project will provide a better understanding of the impact of co-occurring ADHD and anxiety on the clinical presentation, functional outcomes, and neurobiology of ASD. This in turn will improve our ability to stratify young children with ASD into meaningful subgroups. This knowledge will support development of effective and biologically informed methods for early detection and treatment, which can mitigate the negative effects of co-occurring ADHD and anxiety on long-term outcomes of individuals with ASD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The substantial variability in the presentation of autism (ASD) is a key barrier in early diagnosis and in developing and evaluating effective treatments for the disorder. Because of this, the NIH and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) have pushed to better understand the causes and impacts of this variability in individuals with ASD. The proposed project responds to this critical need by clarifying the impact of a potential key source of this variability: co-occurring anxiety and ADHD.",Stratifying the Heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Impact of Co-Occurring Anxiety and ADHD,10118992,R01HD101440,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electroencephalography', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxiety spectrum disorders', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional bias', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'dual diagnosis', 'early childhood', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'individualized medicine', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'movement analysis', 'multimodality', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social deficits', 'treatment response', 'visual tracking']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,602352
"Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD Project Summary  Two of the earliest onset, most common, and costly neurodevelopmental disorders in child psychiatry are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represents a fundamentally confounding factor limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment. In short, simple design assumptions regarding `homogeneity in samples' in typical and atypical populations may explain the frequently very small effect sizes in psychopathology research. Clinically, these same assumptions may account for why treatments often have weak or unpredictable effects.  Recent developments in the computational sciences, have enabled the implementation of models sufficiently complex to address the aforementioned situation regarding subpopulations; however, very few tie the outputs to the specific outcome or questions being asked by the investigator. Under the parent grant, we developed and published a novel hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning method to characterize biologically relevant heterogeneity in ADHD and/or ASD – the Functional Random Forest (FRF). The hybrid FRF combines machine learning and graph theoretic analyses in order to identify population subtypes related to the clinically most important outcomes (in the case, of this proposal, negative valence symptoms) trans- diagnostically (ASD, ADHD, TD).  Despite developing the FRF, subtyping results using functional MRI (fMRI) signals have lagged behind the subtyping of behavioral profiles. In addition, they have yet to become sufficiently sensitive and specific, for rapid translation into clinical practice. Fortunately, parallel advances in functional neuroimaging, allow for precision functional mapping of individuals, and can be synergistically combined with the FRF to greatly boost our ability to subtype and characterize individual patients from fMRI data. Here we combine the FRF with precision mapping to reveal common variants and individual specificity in global brain organization. The proposed individual-specific precision mapping moves beyond group averaging approaches, which are obscuring important inter-individual differences related to distinct pathophysiologies underlying negative valence across diagnoses (ADHD, ASD, TD).  Thus, the current proposal aims to apply FRF algorithms to trans-diagnostic (TD, ASD, ADHD) behavioral and precision functional mapping RSFC data to identify distinct sub-populations across ASD, ADHD, and TD that relate to negative valence symptom dimensions. Project Narrative The proposed study uses novel, advanced imaging techniques (i.e. individual-specific Precision Functional Mapping of resting state functional connectivity MRI), along with new computational tools (i.e. Functional Random Forest) to identify atypical brain physiologies related to negative valence symptoms in trans- diagnostic fashion across ADHD, Autism and typical development. This work will utilize new methods to identify brain biomarkers related to important outcomes of interest (i.e. negative valence symptoms) independent of diagnostic category. The findings from this study will advance our knowledge of the neurobiological underpinnings of negative valence symptomatology, ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes for future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD,10181076,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retinal blind spot', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'brain behavior', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized diagnostics', 'random forest', 'symptomatology', 'treatment stratification', 'treatment trial', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,1157073
"Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV), an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences. Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1. The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably, identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological, cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups. This work could also be relevant for disordered attention in other disorders characterized by high levels of RTV (e.g., Autism). PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders pose challenges to neurobiological analysis as they are complex, routinely co-occur, and are operationalized using behavioral symptoms. We propose to examine the neurobiological basis of reaction time variability in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study in order to explore heterogeneity in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This work may help us better understand how to identify and treat individuals with ADHD.",Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD,10155553,R01MH123831,"['Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reaction Time', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Thick', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'biological systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'improved', 'inattention', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'individualized medicine', 'motor control', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'non-Gaussian model', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'trend']",NIMH,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,399659
