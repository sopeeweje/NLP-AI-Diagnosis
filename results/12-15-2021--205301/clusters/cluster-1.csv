"AUTO SCREENER FOR EPILEPTOFORM EEG DATA A two phase program is described to develop a microprocessor unit to screen 16 channel EEG data in real time and mark those epochs which contain epileptoform activity.  The unit would be marketed as a modular addition to data collection systems already marketed by Telefactor for long-term epilepsy monitoring.  Realization of such a unit involves adapting principles already proven and running on computers in a university environment such as the PDP 11/60.  Modern micorprocessor techniques can now permit recognition modules to price in the $10,000 range.

"PHOTOINDUCED THROMBOTIC STROKE--MECHANISMS AND THERAPY The major goal of this project is to document patterns of platelet deposition, blood flow and edema during the development of focal thrombotic stroke, and the effects of prophylactic agents on mitigating or inhibiting thrombus formation in brain vasculature.  A secondary goal is to determine whether lipid peroxidation is associated with thrombotic stroke, and to characterize the distribution of lipid peroxides in parenchyma and endothelium of the affected tissue zone and correlate this with morphological indices as the stroke progresses.  The proposed studies will utilize our recently characterized model of reproducible focal cerebral infarction precipitated by photochemically induced thrombosis of cortical vasculature, in rats injected systemically with the potent photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal.  The progression of thrombosis will be represented by platelets radiolabeled with IIIindium, and local cerebral blood flow will be evaluated by 14C-labeled iodoantipyrine imaging.  Microvascular occlusion will be visualized directly by carbon-black perfusion.  The effect on these parameters of agents known to mitigate thrombosis of single vessels in vivo will be evaluated in the present context of a network of occluded vasculature; such agents include calcium channel antagonists (nimodipine, nifedipine, verapamil), antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, indomethacin, prostacyclin), free radical scavengers (ethanol, dimethylsufoxide, glycerol) and the clot-specific fibrinolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA).  Enhancement of the effect of t-PA by prior administration of lys-plasminogen will be tested also.  The hypothesis that lipid peroxidation inhibits the recovery of tissue compromised by ischemia can be studied if lipid peroxide formation can be induced in specific tissue zones.  In this model it is likely that platelet adhesion and subsequent aggregation are stimulated by photochemical peroxidation of endothelial lipids.  Owing to the reproducible progression of blood flow deficit in the photoinduced lesion, the present model may facilitate stable conditions for lipid peroxidation, observable as conjugated dienes, in the parenchyma as well.  The relative content (predicted to be low) of endothelial lipid peroxides, and the efficiency of photochemical induction of endothelial defects will be determined by similar experiments conducted with endothelial cells in culture.  The proposed work enables rigorous study of the thrombotic process and its mitigation under well-controlled condition in brain microvessels, with consequent benefit to potential stroke patients.

"VISUOMOTOR COORDINATION:  NEURAL NETWORKS AND SCHEMAS Our approach to analyzing mechanisms of visuomotor coordination is two-fold:  ""top-down"", to offer a coordinated control program of interacting schemas (concurrently active programs suitably structured for action-perception systems) to model behavior noted by neuroethologists; and ""bottom-up"", to provide detailed models of neural networks which are consistent with known anatomy and physiology, but which involve additional assumptions, amenable to experimental test, to yield a network capable of exhibiting appropriate behavior.  Where possible, we implement a family of models, rather than a single model, to facilitate computer experiments and animal experiments which may discriminate between alternative mechanisms. Specifically, we plan to conduct studies of the following subtopics:  (1) Modelling tectum-pretectum interactions subserving pattern-recognition in anurans; (2) Detailed neural modelling of retina; (3) Modelling patterns of behavior in frog and toad while developing a theory of motor schemas and their coordination for orientation, sidestepping, snapping, etc.; and (4) Developing mathematical and computer methodology for exploring a model-family to determine which subset of models approximates satisfaction of a given set of constraints.  The work will make modelling tools available for the analysis of large brain systems.

"SYMPTOM EVOLUTION IN APHASIA: A NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY Two related projects are proposed as part of an application for a Research Career Development Award.  First, it is suggested that information about the evolution of patients' symptoms during recovery from aphasia will provide an important source of constraint on the postulation of explanatory models to account for particular aphasis syndromes.  Three separate experimental batteries are developed to investigate the nature of the underlying deficit in agrammatic Broca's aphasia, conduction aphasia and anomic aphasia.  Specific hypotheses are developed concerning the possible relationships among co-occuring symptoms and their underlying basis. Patients meeting the selection criteria will be tested at several intervals over the course of the first year post-onset using one of the experimental batteries.  A second project is proposed to develop a computer-based system for the simulation and classification of reading and writing errors produced by dyslexic and dysgraphic patients.  This system will focus on the classification of errors involving the translation between graphemes and phonemes, and is intended to investigate the incidence of errors that are related to grapheme-to-phoneme or phoneme-to-grapheme conversion.

"RESEARCH RESOURCE ON COMPUTERS IN BIOMEDICINE The general objective of the Rutgers Resource is to apply advanced methods of computer science, particularly artificial intelligence, to problems of biomedical research and practice.  The Resource will promote the developement and use of computer systems for expert consultation in medical diagnosis and management, and for research assistance in processes of scientific experimentation and theory formation.  Organizing and representing biomedical knowledge at different levels (descriptive, ruled-based mathematical submodels), and relating the levels through generalized strategies for communication and control with a user, constitutes a major component of our proposed research.  We continue the present structure of the Resource, with a set of core projects concentrating on general artificial intelligence investigations, and a set of collaborative projects that provide the context within which the methods can be tested.  The major areas of biomedical application are in rheumatology, where we are collaborating with Drs. D. Lindberg & G. Sharp at the University of Missouri-Columbia, in clinical pathology, where we are working with Dr. Robert Galen of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and in ophthalmology, where we have a major collaboration with Dr. C. Dawson at the University of California-San Francisco.  An important aspect of our research is technology transfer, producing prototypes that will be useful to clinical researchers and practitioners.  We have pioneered developments in this field by putting an expert system on a chip, incorporated in a widely used clinical instrument:  a serum protein electrophoresis analysizer.  We have also succeeded in transferring the large rheumotology consultation knowledge base onto a M68000 microprocessor machine, which will be accessible and affordable to smaller investigative groups and clinicians.  We are proposing to continue these innovations through experimentation with different kinds of microprocessor systems, introducing better graphics and other user-friendly interfaces.  These systems will be tested and evaluated by our biomedical collaborators.  In addition to the research in the Resource, we intend to continue the highly successful dissemination activities of the AIM Workshop series, and the Rutgers participation in national AIM collaborative research.  We are proposing to purchase sufficient workstations for intensive software development in the Resource, and enough microcient workstations for intensive software development in the Resource, and enough microprocessor based systems for testing and diffusion of our prototypes to the AIM community.

"NOVEL PROBES FOR EFFICIENT GENETIC DISEASE DIAGNOSIS Current techniques for the diagnosis of genetic disease are limited by an inability to detect the majority of mutations and polymorphisms in DNA. DNA molecules which differ by one or a few base pairs can most efficiently be distinguished currently by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis due to sequence specific differences in melting properties of the DNA. However, base changes can be detected only in domains of the molecule which melt first in these gels.  We propose to improve this technique so that base pair changes can be detected in all domains of a DNA molecule.  We will modify DNA probes in ways that will significantly alter the melting behavior of DNA hybrids, so that new regions of the DNA molecule will be included in the first melting domain.  In addition, we will use experimental data to generate computer models to predict melting behavior of modified DNA molecules.  These computer programs can then be used to design optimal probes for detecting sequence changes in any DNA molecule. This technology should be broad enough for application to any gene of interest, and could lead to the commercial development of diagnostic tests for a number of genetic diseases.
