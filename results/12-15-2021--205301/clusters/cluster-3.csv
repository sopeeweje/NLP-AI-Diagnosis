"STEPPED-CARE COLLEAGUE:  AUTOMATED THERAPY REVIEW IN HYP Clinical decision support systems and medical information systems are both of great interest in medical informatics.  Ideally these two types of systems should be closely linked to provide maximum educational and clinical utility.  Usually medical informatics development emphasizes one type of system to the exclusion of the other.  The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a generic, linked system in which medical knowledge represented in the decision support module is applied in the clinical setting in the context of an existing information system.  The major advantages are practical:  the data required by the decision support system is already available; no special data collection or entry is needed.  The advice given by the decision support system is presented in clinical ""real-time"" to optimize its effect.  The second objective is to maximally exploit non-artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM) systems for representing medical knowledge and decision making processes when appropriate.  This is cost effective and, if sufficiently robust, may be adequate for many types of medical decision problems.  In this proposal we plan to develop general methods and apply them to a single clinical setting:  hypertension care.  The specific work will test the hypothesis that an automated therapeutic management review system may be created, using a non-AIM rule-based structure coupled with a system designed to frequently gather pertinent clinical information, to provide sophisticated analysis of current medical management for providers.  The system will survey current clinical data and, following a stepped care approach to the treatment of hypertension, advise providers as to when they should increase therapy, modify therapy, or reduce therapy in appropriate circumstances.  The prototype system will be studied in a general medicine practice. Testing will involve the examination of its performance in terms of reliability and validity, its psychological impact on providers and their perception of benefit and satisfaction, and its cost and impact on stepped care therapy.  If this development and feasibility project is successful, we will consider submitting a proposal to subject the developed system to more definitive study.

"DERIVING KNOWLEDGE FROM CLINICAL DATABASES The major concern of the RX Project is with the development of tools for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of health care data. Specifically, the objectives of the project are 1) to increase the validity and ease of data analysis and interpretation and 2) to facilitate the process of hypothesis generation and preliminary confirmation.  The principal focus of our research will continue to be on the RX Study Module.  Utilizing an on-line knowledge base of clinical medicine and of statistical procedures, the Study Module is designed to assist a researcher with the task of creating a comprehensive, mathematically correct study design using appropriate data from a large clinical database.  The Study Module determines an overall study design choosing between cross-sectional and longitudinal methods, it determines significant confounding variables and methods for controlling them, it determines patient eligibility criteria, and it formulates a mathematical model for testing the hypothesis.  Finally, the Study Module automatically runs the study design on a statistical package and assists with the interpretation of results.  A second focus of our work is in methods for aiding hypothesis generation. We seek to facilitate this process by developing improved means for labeling and accessing patient records.  We are also interested in developing methods for automating the dicovery of hypotheses by using methods from the field of artificial intelligence.  Our method will use a medical knowledge base to focus the search for promising hypotheses.  Our planned research for all these endeavors will build on our present algorithms and the current RX prototype.  We will test the resulting system by the performance of specific rheumatologic studies using a 1,700 patient database provided to us by the American Rheumatism Association Medical Information System research group.

"TWO DIMENSIONAL PHOTON COUNTING POSTITION ENCODER A two-dimensional Photon Counting Position Encoder is proposed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) medical cameras.  The new detector uses three new concepts:  1) a method of controlling the spatial distribution of photons from Bismuth Germanate Scintillators, 2) the use of all digital photon counting for processing the photomultiplier signal, and 3) the use of pattern recognition to encode position.  The new detector is expected to reduce the cost of this portion of the PET scanner by approximately a factor of eight.  The cost reduction anticipated for a typical four ring camera will be in the range of $600,000 to $1,000,000 which is 20-40 percent of the cost of the PET scanner.  In addition to the potential cost savings of this new approach, the photon division technique will allow one to obtain 2-3 mm position resolution in two dimensions.  The state-of-the art commercial scanners.

"MULTI-COMPUTER BASED PATHOLOGY DIAGNOSES SUPPORT SYSTEM The goal of this project is to design a full function Pathology Diagnoses Support System to facilitate the collection, storage, and analysis of histopathology data.  The system will be designed to provide the pathologist maximum flexibility in specification of:  glossary content and organization; method of identification of key data entities (cage, study, animal, etc...); and sequencing of menu selectable items.  This flexibility will allow the pathologist to tailor the system to the requirements of the site or study. The system will also incorporate emerging artificial intelligence/expert system techniques for collection and data presentation, such as voice input/output and automatic sequencing of menus based on frequency of use.  Major technical design criteria beyond the flexibility and variety of specifications provided to the user will focus on: allowing the system to operate on multiple types of computers; operate in both single and multi-user environments; a modular layered design for maximum machine portability and extensibility of system functions; utilization of commercial data storage and analysis tools to capitalize on their expanding base of capabilities; and providing maximum ease of integration into existing information systems through extensive import and export utilities for all system data.
