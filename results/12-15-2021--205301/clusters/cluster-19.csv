"DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL HEARING FOR THE DEAF The effort to develop artificial hearing systems for the deaf has recently been focussed on tactual vocoders, devices that transduce acoustic energy into vibratory or electrocutaneous signals which are then applied to the skin.  Current tactual vocoders, however, are based largely upon untested assumptions about optimal filter configurations for speech processing.  In a study which carefully controls device variables (through use of software filters and computer driven displays) while systematically varying filter configurations, perception of critical features of the speech code will be studied.  Using psychophysical techniques, the research seeks to describe the tactual perception of speech features based on signals processed through filter banks with linear, logarithmic and composite spacings for both 32 and 16 channel displays.  The studies will:  1. determine discrimination and identification of speech contrasts along various speech-simulating continua for each of the filter configurations;  2. provide an empirical basis for the design of tactual vocoders with optimal filter configurations; and  3. lay the foundations for a miniaturized tactual vocoder design to be implemented in succeeding phases of the work.  This work is directed toward the development and ultimate manufacture of a portable, wearable, cosmetically acceptable, artificial hearing prosthesis for the deaf.

"PHASE II RESEARCH ON SOUND-MAKING PRODUCTS FOR INFANTS The visual ""mobiles"" attached to infant cribs are devices designed to provide the infant with visual stimulation.  There are no devices currently on the market that provide infants with complex and interesting auditory stimulation.  Yet, studies by this research team show that very young infants have a keen sense of hearing and are capable of discriminating fine differences in complex sounds such as speech.  More importantly, our work suggests that infants like listening to speech, particularly when it conforms to the kind of speech that is addressed to them by caretakers. The particular kind of speech has many special properties, and has been given the name ""Motherese.""  Our laboratory research indicates that infants prefer to listen to Motherese over the kind of speech that is addressed to adults.  Moreover, the work shows that the main feature attracting infant attention towards Motherese is its unique acoustic characteristics, indluding an increase in pitch, exaggerated pitch contours, and a slower tempo.  This Phase-I research project proposes to examine the feasibility of creating an ""Auditory Mobile"" for infants--a device that presents Motherese and other complex signals that mimic its salient acoustic characteristics to infants.  The special features of this device include the fact that it is programmable and activated by the infant's vocalizations.  The proposal requests support for research that would further specify the parameters of auditory signals that should be contained in an Auditory Mobile and begin work on the technical problems of speech synthesis and recognition required by the device.

"PROCESSOR CONTROLLED HEARING AID The long term objective of the proposed program is the development, design and manufacture of a signal processor-controlled hearing aid to maintain the overall sound pressure level (SPL) and the spectrum at the eardrum within optimum limits for the hearing impaired individual for allexpected input spectra and input levels.  An additional feature will be an increase in signal-to-noise ratio of the aided signal.  The signal processing will be based on the actual eardrum SPL, determined from an acoustic feedback signal obtained by a microphone or probe in the ear canal.  For all expected input levels, the spectrum of the eardrum sound pressure is controlled by the processor, so that the peak SPL in any 1/3-octave interval does not exceed the individual's loudness discomfort level (LDL) while still maintaining the desired spectrum and SPL at its most effective value.  The processor compares the inputs and outputs for each filter and the gain in each channel is then adjusted (on a real time basis) to obtain the desired output for the band.  Determination of averaging times for both the input and output signals are significant and will constitute a major element in the study.  Phase I objective is to breadboard this system (without) the signal-to-noise ratio improvement) and test it on a manikin, equipped with a ANSI S3.25-1979 simulator.

"ALGORITHMS FOR ARRHYTHMIA IDENTIFICATION Our general goal is automatic identification of arrhythmias within implantable devices by computer-based signal processing of the intracardiac electrograms.  This goal appears to be realizable because:  1) the arrhythmias to be identified can be provoked in the catheter electrophysiology laboratory and the resulting electrograms can be recorded for detailed analysis; 2) modern signal processing techniques exist for characterizing the electrograms in the time domain and by spectral content; 3) computer algorithms can be designed to recognize these characteristic electrogram features in each arrhythmia; 4) implantable microcomputers are available in which the algorithms can be implemented.  An important premise of this proposal is that the hardware for electrical termination of arrhythmia is already availbale and thus there is a risk of new generations of devices being implanted for arrhythmia control before the underlying electrophysiologic concepts and pattern recognition rules for identifying the arrhythmia are developed and tested.  The signal processing algorithms and decision rules for automatic detection and discrimination will be implemented in real time in a computer program small enough to be part of an implanted anti-tachycardia or defibrillating device.  We will first examine and describe in both the time and frequency domains the characteristic features of electrograms recorded during provocative electrophysiologic study in animals and humans.  Then we will develop computer algorithms for signal processing of the electrograms and for arrhythmia pattern recognition.  Finally, we will test the stated hypotheses by conducting additional animal and human electrophysiology studies and determining the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms. Our approach combines the engineering skill of computer-based signal analysis with the medical skill of diagnostic cardiac electrophysiology. It is our expectation that this approach will provide a sound scientific basis upon which development of specific hardware by pacemaker manufacturers can proceed.
