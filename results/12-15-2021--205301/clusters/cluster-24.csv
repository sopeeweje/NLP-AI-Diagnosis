"ARRAY PROCESSOR FOR MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING A powerful array processor to be attached to our existing VAX 11/780 computer is requested.  This instrument will be dedicated to research in medical imaging and image processing.  Specifically, four projects are proposed, two each in digital radiology and nuclear medicine.  In digital radiology, the goal of the proposed research is to deblur subtraction angiograms by using sophisticated image processing algorithms, thereby facilitating the visualization of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries.  Two distinct processing algorithms will be investigated.  Both of these algorithms are well known in the image processing leterature, but have not yet been applied to large medical images for lack of sufficient computer power.  The nuclear medicine projects have as their goal earlier detection and more accurate characterization of small neoplasms.  In one of these projects, three-dimensional images will be reconstructed from coded-aperture data.  This approach allows true tomographic reconstruction without any motion of the detector or aperture.  The other nuclear medicine project involves automated feature extraction and pattern recognition of liver scans.  In addition, it will include an attempt to optimize the design of nuclear imaging systems for most accurate extraction of the relevant features.

"ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS IN OCULAR INFLAMMATORY DISEASE The major goals of this proposal are the prevention of blindness and of morbidity associated with inflammatory eye diseases, particularly trachoma and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.  In the studies of trachoma, we will (1) develop improved techniques for treating it, (2) elucidate the role of Chlamydia trachomatis as an agent of systemic illness, particularly childhood pneumonia, in trachoma endemic areas, (3) evaluate new techniques for the rapid, inexpensive diagnosis of chlamydial infections, (4) attempt to further define the immunological response to C. trachomatis infections in trachoma through the use of specific chlamydial antigens.  The hypothesis underlying these studies is that blindness and morbidity associated with endemic trachoma can be prevented, but that will involve new technologies for detection and treatment.  While these studies on ocular chlamydial infection will be directed at practical, applied goals, we also will examine at a basic level the pathogenesis of chronic trachoma.  By defining the antibody response to specific chlamydial antigens and the patterns of cellular response in the eye, we plan to develop a means to identify cases who are at risk of the blinding complications or who will not respond well to chemotherapy.  This knowledge will be needed as a basis for the evaluation of possible subunit trachoma vaccines.  The studies on ocular herpes simplex virus infections will focus on improving the management of this condition by the development of a computer based, artificial intelligence model of HSV eye infections that can be used as an expert consultant for management of herpetic eye disease.  Continued development of this model will elucidate specific problems in the complex management of the disease.  The model will be further extended to include the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial corneal ulcers and other forms of keratitis and uveitis.

"NUCLEAR DNA AND MORPHOMETRIC STUDIES OF GYNECOLOGIC CANC The goals of this project are to improve our understanding of carcinogenesis in gynecologic cancers and to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracies using quantitative analyses.  During the past year, a close relationship between human papillomavirus infection (genital warts, condylomas) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (squamous dysplasias and carcinomas in situ) has been confirmed by nuclear DNA quantitation, immunoperoxidase stain for human papillomavirus capsid antigens, and morphologic analyses.  Using these techniques, it is possible to demonstrate a transition from cervical condyloma to neoplasia.  This occurrence is supported by the coexistence of papillomavirus capsid antigens and aneuploid DNA patterns in 14% of cervical condylomatous lesions.  The risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is increased in flat rather than exophytic condylomas, and in condylomas with moderate as compared to mild degree of nuclear atypia.  These findings support the recent molecular hybridization studies indicating that several types of human papillomaviruses with different oncogenicities exist in the female genital tract.  In 51 patients with clinical stage I or II cervical adenocarcinoma, the survival is most reliably predicted by the standard deviation of nuclear size (p=0.002), the DNA ploidy level (p=0.003), the clinical stage (p=0.0072), the percentage of glandular lumen (p=0.0074), the mean nuclear size (p=0.04), and the histologic grade (p=0.09).  These findings demonstrate that the prognostic accuracies can be improved by quantitative analyses over the routine histologic examinations.

"PROTEIN MARKERS OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA The molecular events associated with the development of renal cell carcinoma are essentially unknown and useful biochemical markers for this tumor are not available.  High-resolution protein separation techniques have been used in preliminary experiments to identify a group of proteins which are associated with the tumor, but absent or significantly reduced in normal renal cortex.  This application has as its long-term objective the understanding of the role these proteins play in the expression of the malignant phenotype and the determination of whether serum, urine, or tissue assays for these proteins are of clinical relevance.  The first specific aim of this proposal concerns the production of monoclonal antibodies to these proteins through the immunization of mice with protein spots cut from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, a recently developed technique.  The second aim deals with the use of these antibodies to help isolate and characterize the proteins as to molecular weight, subunit composition, glycosylation, cellular localization, and tissue specificity. These studies will use two-dimensional electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, and immunohistochemical staining.  The third specific aim deals with the evaluation of three established renal cell carcinoma-derived cell lines as model systems.  Quantitative computer-aided pattern analysis will be used to compare two-dimensional gels of the cultured cells and tumor tissue, and immunologic methods will also be used to confirm the presence or absence of the carcinoma-associated proteins in the cultured cells.  Specific aim four will be to determine by immunoassay if any of the carcinoma-associated proteins or circulating antibodies to these proteins are present in the serum of patients with this tumor.  If so, preliminary studies will be initiated to determine the potential clinical usefulness for the detection, staging, or typing of renal tumors.  The studies outlined here should provide fundamental information about the biochemistry, cell biology, and clinical chemistry of a group of proteins associated with renal cell carcinoma and provide the necessary tools and information to pursue one or several of these proteins in greater detail in the future.  Moreover, should clinically useful markers be developed, this would point the way towards the use of these same methods in other tumor systems.

"ANALYSIS OF Z BANDS IN HEART BY OPTICAL DIFFRACTION In human cardiocytes, the contractile units are linked together by Z bands. Although specific proteins have been localized in Z band regions of some vertebrate muscles, the organization of these proteins into a filament lattice is unknown.  Z bands vary in width but the functional significance of this variation remains obscure.  Using optical diffraction methods we have been able to analyze Z and bands greater than 90 nm wide in mammalian cardiac and slow skeletal muscle and have identified a common structural unit.  Our optical reconstruction studies show that these units are added side-to-side and end-to-end to make a regular arrangement of axial and connecting filaments. However, the entire Z band is rarely a uniform lattice.  Optical reconstructions strongly suggest variation in the arrangement of connecting filaments in the Z band at rest length and suggest that the Z band is a dynamic structure.  Our purpose in these studies is to further determine the organization of Z band components in both normal and widened Z bands and to relate this organization to proposed functions for Z bands.  A systematic approach for Z band analysis using goniometer tilt and stereo techniques for electron microscopy at standard and high voltages, together with optical diffraction and reconstruction methods, will be continued.  We will expand our multilevel approach to include studies of Z bands 1)  in normal muscle fixed after repeated stimulation and after fatigue; 2)  in normal muscle partially extracted and reconstituted; 3)  in isolated myofibrils or Z disc sheets and in developing muscle.  Additional techniques to be used are computerized image processing, protein isolation and separation and antibody localization.  Structural analysis of Z bands in normal and developing muscle should contribute to our understanding of muscle cell function.

"AUTOMATED CANCER CELL DIAGNOSIS BY THE TICAS METHOD The goal of this research is to study high-resolution image analysis of cervical cells for diagnostic assessment of patients.  The discovery of the marker features for the presence of dysplasia or malignant disease expressed in ""normal appearing"" intermediate cells from the ectocervix has affected the very strategy of prescreening for cervical cancer.  If confirmed on a large database of patients, the finding of frank tumor cells could be replaced by the statistical assessment of a limited sample of a patient's intermediate cells to ascertain whether visual review of the patient's sample is required.  Complementing the analysis of marker features in cells coming from normal patients, patients with dysplasia, with carcinoma in situ, and with invasive cancer, a new technique has been developed to measure the ploidy of cells appearing in Papanicolaou smears and histological sections.  It appears that the rapid availability of this new kind of information may add significant, new prognostic dimensions to the diagnostic techniques being developed.  The statistical distribution of the DNA content in individual nuclei has been shown to be significantly correlated with the malignancy of tumors and the patient prognosis.  The high-resolution technique for ploidy measurement is proven to be precise, accurate, and fast.  We have now completed the measurement of 50 cases designated as either dysplastic or having carcinoma in situ.  For each case, this involves the collection of:  (1)\intermediate blue cell images from vaginal, cervical, and endocervical smear preparations; (2)\dysplastic cell images from dysplasia cases; (3)\carcinoma in situ cell images from carcinoma in situ cases; (4)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from the cytology preparations; and (5)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from histological specimens obtained by biopsy.  DNA results are now routinely produced with a variety of parameters that are being correlated with the results of discriminant analysis on the intermediate blue cell populations.

"IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON INDUSTRIAL INSPECTOR STRESS The objective of this research is to determine how both human stress and human performance vary with the level of automation in an industrial inspection job.  Industry is demanding higher quality of its workers and of its inspectors who are charged with maintaining and monitoring that quality.  At the same time, sophisticated automation is becoming available to extend the human inspector's capabilities on some tasks within the inspection job.  Inspection is known to be a stressful job and, with these two trends, a job which is likely to increase in stressfulness.  A machine, called a Color Video Comparator or CVC, will be used to obtain six levels of inspection automation from unaided human inspection through automated display, sequencing and pacing to a pattern-recognition algorithm.  Performance and task stress will be measured in a laboratory task of inspection printed circuit boards for eight subjects at each level of automation.  The procedure follows one already performed successfully at one level for the Western Electric Company.  This company will supply the CVC and the circuit boards used in the study.  Parts of the laboratory study will be replicated using inspectors at two Western Electric plants so that differences between task stress and job stress can be measured.  The results of the project will be of value to designers of automated and semi-automated systems as they will help to specify the level of automation which gives the best balance between system performance and operator stress.

"NEUTROPHIL AND ENDOTHELIAL/EPITHELIAL CELL INTERACTIONS Inflammatory reactions in the airways involve emigration of neutrophils across the blood vessel endothelium and then across the pulmonary epithelium.  It is hypothesized that this inflammatory cell accumulation can lead to altered airway reactivity.  Stimulated neutrophils can produce epithelial injury and/or increased permeability which may provide better access for antigens, mediators, and/or irritants to neuronal and/or humoral trigger mechanisms in the airway.  In this project we will examine the mechanisms involved in four aspects of neutrophils emigration and epithelial injury:  (1) adherence of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium, (2) transendothelial migration, (3) transepithelial migration, and (4) epithelial injury by neutrophils activated on the apical side of the epithelium.  We will used cell culture techniques to study endothelial cells from large vessels and from the microvasculature and epithelial cells from alveoli and large airways.  For many of the studies we will use human neutrophils and human endothelial and epithelial cells.  Adherence will be assayed with radiolabeled neutrophils and with video microscopy with computer assisted image analysis.  Migration will be studied in standard chemotactic chambers and in specially designed horizontal and vertical chambers for measurement of bioelectric properties of the monolayers and their permeability.  Questions to be addressed include the following:   Are there specific sites or macromolecules on endothelial cells or epithelial cells to which neutrophils attach?  Do endothelial cells or epithelial cells produce factors which increase or decrease adherence?  Do neutrophils alter the barrier properties of endothelial and epithelial monolayers during migration?  Our central hypothesis is that endothelial cells and epithelial cells play an active role in neutrophil emigration,and once we know the mechanism for this facilitated movement, new pharmacologic strategies for control of inflammation may be possible.  The mechanism of neutrophil adherence and migration should also be applicable to other inflammatory lung diseases such as pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome.

"MEDIATORS OF INSULIN-DEPENDENT MESSENGER RNA SYNTHESIS Insulin prevents the induction of mRNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dubutyryl cyclic AMP and hydrocortisone in Reuber hepatoma cells but simultaneously acts in an additive fashion with these agents in inducing tyrosine aminotransferase.  These results imply that these agents interact to promote or inhibit mRNA production from specific genes. Therefore, this project will test the idea that insulin, cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids alter production of specific messenger RNAs in Reuber hepatoma cells by altering the charge, abundance or intracellular distribution of genetic regulatory proteins.  Two model proteins that translocate to the nucleus and are probably involved in transcriptional regulation (the glucocorticoid receptor and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase) will be identified in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (2D-PAGE) of radiolabeled extracts of whole cells, nuclei and chromatin. These proteins will be studied to find whether hormonal combinations that alter mRNA induction alter their activation or translocation to the nucleus.  Activation will be sought as changes in the charge (phosphorylation state or other modification) of these receptors using 2D-PAGE.  Translocation will be detected as decreased association of these proteins with the cytosol and increased association with the nucleus after hormonal stimulation, again identifying the receptors with 2D-PAGE.  Cells will be treated with insulin to identify molecules whose charge or abundance is regulated by this hormone, and a molecule will be sought that becomes associated with chromatin after insulin treatment.  Nuclear events such as translocation of regulatory molecules or altered phosphorylation of histones and other proteins will be identified and attempts will be made to correlate these events with altered production of messenger RNAs.  Events that correlate with insulin's ability to abolish the induction of messenger RNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids, will be pursued.  If a putative regulator is found, I will attempt to purify it, study how it is activated, and determine how it associates with chromatin or DNA.  Knowledge of how protein effectors are stimulated by insulin to regulate genetic events is fundamental to the understanding of long-term changes brought about by insulin, and conversely, of changes expected in the course of diabetes.

"CERVICAL CANCER DETECTION AND SCREENING (PHASE II) The objective of this research is to develop new and improved diagnostic instrumentation for cervical cancer detection and screening.

To develop new methods that allow expert programs to explain and justify their conclusions by arguing from fundamental medical facts and principles and reconstructing the path by which those bases have led to the program's behavior; to improve the application of automatic programming methods to allow the performance program to be generated automatically from these facts and principles.  3.

"ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS IN OCULAR INFLAMMATORY DISEASES Our goal is the prevention of blindness and morbidity associated with inflammatory eye diseases, particularly trachoma and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.  The studies proposed on trachoma will examine in detail the variations in host response to a single well characterized organism (Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the eye).  It will allow us to evaluate response of the external eye to infection and the variations in disease that are intrinsic or induced (e.g. atopy or depressed cellular immunity.  the grading of host repsonse (trachoma intensity) and microbial load (number of chlamydial elementary bodies) provide a quantitative system to study this interaction of host and environmental factors.  In the studies of chlamydial infections we will (1) initiate studies on the role of individual host response to chlamydial infection; (2) elucidate the role of Chlamydia trachomatis as a cause of other illness in trachoma endemic areas; (3) evaluate new technology for the diagnosis of ocular chlamydial infections; (4) develop and validate simplified diagnostic techniques for endemic trachoma; (5) continue limited treatment trials for the prevention of blindness from trachoms.  The major theme of these studies on trachoma will be an evaluation of the host response to infection of the conjunctiva.  An important intermediate goal will be the identification of those host factors that are associated with the blingind consequences of trachoma.  Herpes simplex virus and other infections of the eye continue to be a major problem, both in the United States and in other countries.  Although treatment of ocular herpes has improved considerably in recent years, the disease continues to cause loss of vision and morbidity in many patients. In order to improve treatment of this disease by ophthalmologists, further refinements will be made in a computer model to provide treatment recommendations for herpetic eye disease.

"MAXIMUM ENTROPY DENSITIES We propose to investigate the possibilities of a new paradigm for nonparametric probability density estimation (NPDE).  Recent advances in the fields of NPDE and maximum entropy support the above proposal.  It is expected that this new approach to NPDE will be able to unify several ad-hoc procedures currently used in NPDE.  This information - theoretic approach to density estimation is defined as a variational problem and uses the Kullback number as the fundamental measure of separation between probability densities.  The connections of NPDE with the general problem of smoothing of data, with the estimation of the failure rate in medical experiments and with the problem of pattern recognition in artificial intelligence make the pursuit of a unifying theory of NPDE very desirable.

"DEVELOPMENT OF DYNAMIC DIGITAL CHEST IMAGING TECHNIQUES The goal of the proposed research is to develop new dynamic chest imaging techniques based on a digital radiographic system that has a large image intensifier (57-cm)-TV system as the x-ray detector.  The new techniques are distinctly different from existing chest imaging techniques in that they utilize the unique physical characteristcs of the digital system; a large area detector, effective scatter rejection, rapid image acquisition, and computerized image processing.  These methods have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy for detection of pulmonary diseases at reduced patient exposure and risk, as well as at a reduced cost.  The specific aims of this research include:  (1) studies of pulmonary ventilation with non-radioactive xenon gas as the contrast medium, and (2) detection of pulmonary embolism by digital subtraction radiography with or without contrast injection.  The application of dynamic digital techniques to chest radiography can provide quantitative and dynamic data for evaluation of pulmonary ventilation and pulmonary embolism.  Initially, the basic imaging parameters of dynamic chest imaging will be optimized by using Monte Carlo simulation studies based on patient dose, detective quantum efficiency of the image intensifier, contrast sensitivity, and antiscatter techniques.  A beam equalizing filter device will be developed for reducing the dynamic range of the chest radiographs. Secondly, phantom studies will be applied to determine the imaging characteristics of the new techniques.  Thirdly, computer algorithms will be developed for quantitative analysis of the dynamic information recorded in the images.  Finally, preliminary clinical studies will be performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the dynamic imaging techniques.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPH NODE DISEASES We seek support to (1) investigate fundamental issues in applications of artificial intelligence to medicine within the context of lymph node pathology and (2) construct a useful diagnostic system for the hematopathology field.  The complexity of hematopathology poses a rich set of challenges for artificial intelligence in medicine.  Our research addresses fundamental problems of knowledge representation, reasoning strategies, user modeling, explanation, and user acceptance.  Our goal is to build a useful decision system for pathologists.  Such a working system would be extraordinarily useful for the lymph node pathology field.  Many studies have documented that there are major problems in the diagnosis and classification of malignant lymphomas and they are often confused with benign diseases.  This poses a major problem for the oncologist as accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment.  We have built a prototype experty system called PATHFINDER which makes diagnoses of lymph node pathology through a consideration of 50 malignant and 30 benign diseases and approximately 500 histopathologic findings.  The program uses the method of sequential diagnosis; it can generate differential diagnoses based on a small number of findings and can suggest other findings useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis.  Consensus meetings have already resulted in agreement on features and diseases to be used by the program. Our research plans are to further develop PATHFINDER so that it can become not only a regularly used diagnostic tool for users having different levels of training and experience, but also can serve as a powerful teaching system.  The proposed expert system will provide a unique integrated knowledge base for the benign diseases of lymph nodes.  AIDS, and lymphomas giving the practicing pathologist immediate access to accurate morphologic classification and diagnostic criteria, while at the same time providing guidance as to whether additional tests (immunologic, cytogenetic, cell-kinetic, and immunogenetic) are likely to be informative.  It is anticipated that a working diagnostic system could improve the reproducibility and reliability of lymphoma diagnosis, facilitate the standardization of diagnoses in clinical trials, and help ensure appropriate therapy at the community hospital level.  We plan to substantially increase the quantity and quality of knowledge through (1) the integration of independent knowledge bases from the four experts mentioned above, (2) the integration of laboratory, clinical, immunologic, cell kinetic, cytogenetic, and immunogenetic information, and (3) the restructuring of the knowledge base to include dependencies among features.  Furthermore, we will (4) facilitate the identification of morphologic features and standardize definitions of features and diseases by incorporating detailed textual and pictorial descriptions (using videodisk technology), (5) develop mapping schemes that will facilitate the understanding of the many classification systems for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and (6) implement methods for the detection of multiple discordant histologies, progression of disease over time, and atypical proliferation.  Also, we will implement and incorporate into the program (1) scoring methods when features are interdependent, (2) heuristics for high-level control of reasoning strategies, (3) heuristics which customize the bahavior of the program to the expertise of the user, (4) formal decision analysis techniques, and (5) methods for system explanation. Throughout the three year period, we will also monitor our progress through iterative testing of reasoning strategies and frequent validations of the program's knowledge.

"THEORETICAL STUDIES OF MACROMOLECULES We will carry out calculations in four main areas.  First, we describe a pattern-matching approach to prediction of protein secondary structure. This program can be coupled to the tertiary packing algorithms of Cohen et.al. to produce protein-like structures.  In the best case with proteins that have been studied crystallographically, discrepancies of ca. 4 angstroms are observed.  Methods of reducing these errors are evaluated. Second, we seek a detailed model for the motions of ligands in proteins. Conventional molecular dynamics and trajectory calculations will be compared to methods that reveal packing defects and channels in proteins in a direct way.  Third, we wish to extend our docking calculations to macromolecular interactions and to systematic structural comparison of sets of bioactive compounds.

"NUCLEAR DNA AND MORPHOMETRIC STUDIES OF GYNECOLOGIC CANC The goals of this project are to improve our understanding of carcinogenesis in gynecologic cancers and to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracies using quantitative analyses.  During the past year, a close relationship between human papillomavirus infection (genital warts, condylomas) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (squamous dysplasias and carcinomas in situ) has been confirmed by nuclear DNA quantitation, immunoperoxidase stain for human papillomavirus capsid antigens, and morphologic analyses.  Using these techniques, it is possible to demonstrate a transition from cervical condyloma to neoplasia.  This occurrence is supported by the coexistence of papillomavirus capsid antigens and aneuploid DNA patterns in 14% of cervical condylomatous lesions.  The risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is increased in flat rather than exophytic condylomas, and in condylomas with moderate as compared to mild degree of nuclear atypia.  These findings support the recent molecular hybridization studies indicating that several types of human papillomaviruses with different oncogenicities exist in the female genital tract.  In 51 patients with clinical stage I or II cervical adenocarcinoma, the survival is most reliably predicted by the standard deviation of nuclear size (p=0.002), the DNA ploidy level (p=0.003), the clinical stage (p=0.0072), the percentage of glandular lumen (p=0.0074), the mean nuclear size (p=0.04), and the histologic grade (p=0.09).  These findings demonstrate that the prognostic accuracies can be improved by quantitative analyses over the routine histologic examinations.

"CONTEXT-BASED AUTOMATED DETECTION OF ABNORMAL EEG WAVES The proposed research will investigate the development of an ""intelligent"", multichannel (16 channels) automated (general purpose computer-based) system for the reliable detection of epileptogenic sharp waveforms (spikes and shart waves-STs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG).  The system will provide the time of occurrence of individual STs, their spatial location, along with values of pertinent electrographic characteristics (e.g. amplitude, duration) thereof.  Special attention will be given to the minimization of false alarms due to artifact and normal EEG activity.  Such a system will especially facilitate the rapid and reliable analysis of long-term EEG recordings from subjects with known or suspected epilepsy, thus contributing to their optimum therapeutic management as well as resulting in savings of time and money.  Extensive heuristics based on human pattern recognition, which involves contextbased analysis, will be utilized.  In this way, the system will incorporate the intelligence of an electroencephalographer (EEGer).  An Artificial Intelligence approach will be implemented, whereby EEG features quantifying candidate waveforms, as well as automated assessment of the subject's state of consciousness will be presented to an Expert System for eventual decision making.  The knowledge base of the Expert system will be developed in close cooperation with an experienced EEGer, so that the extensive contextbased heuristics utilized in the visual analysis process (e.g. spatio-temporal processing involving multichannel correlations) will be implemented.  Special emphasis will be given to programming into the detection system the ability to discriminate against ST-like artifactual activity in the EEG record (e.g. electrocardiographic and electromyographic interference) as well as against sharp but normal EEG activity (e.g. sleep spindles).  Extensive validation studies will be conducted utilizing EEG data from epileptic subjects, other patients, and normal controls.  An investigation will also take place of the possibility of implementing the detection system in a microprocessor-based version for portability and ease of operation.

"PROTEIN MARKERS OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA The molecular events associated with the development of renal cell carcinoma are essentially unknown and useful biochemical markers for this tumor are not available.  High-resolution protein separation techniques have been used in preliminary experiments to identify a group of proteins which are associated with the tumor, but absent or significantly reduced in normal renal cortex.  This application has as its long-term objective the understanding of the role these proteins play in the expression of the malignant phenotype and the determination of whether serum, urine, or tissue assays for these proteins are of clinical relevance.  The first specific aim of this proposal concerns the production of monoclonal antibodies to these proteins through the immunization of mice with protein spots cut from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, a recently developed technique.  The second aim deals with the use of these antibodies to help isolate and characterize the proteins as to molecular weight, subunit composition, glycosylation, cellular localization, and tissue specificity. These studies will use two-dimensional electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, and immunohistochemical staining.  The third specific aim deals with the evaluation of three established renal cell carcinoma-derived cell lines as model systems.  Quantitative computer-aided pattern analysis will be used to compare two-dimensional gels of the cultured cells and tumor tissue, and immunologic methods will also be used to confirm the presence or absence of the carcinoma-associated proteins in the cultured cells.  Specific aim four will be to determine by immunoassay if any of the carcinoma-associated proteins or circulating antibodies to these proteins are present in the serum of patients with this tumor.  If so, preliminary studies will be initiated to determine the potential clinical usefulness for the detection, staging, or typing of renal tumors.  The studies outlined here should provide fundamental information about the biochemistry, cell biology, and clinical chemistry of a group of proteins associated with renal cell carcinoma and provide the necessary tools and information to pursue one or several of these proteins in greater detail in the future.  Moreover, should clinically useful markers be developed, this would point the way towards the use of these same methods in other tumor systems.
