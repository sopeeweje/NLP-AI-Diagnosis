"NORMALIZED BODY SURFACE POTENTIAL MAPS The research has been divided into the following four integrated components:  (1) Instrumentation - Completion of the development of ""State-of-the Art"" Instrumentation to rapidly obtain, on-line and stand-alone at all age groups, electrocardiographic low noise body surface potential color coded maps (BSPM) utilizing 180 passive electrodes with active cables.  Insuring optimal safety in obtaining BSPM simultaneous with indwelling cardiac electrode catheters.  (2) Clinical Studies - four major subprojects.  a) Correlations of simultaneously obtained BSPM with endocardial electrophysiological studies (EPS), with analysis of spread of activation from known positioned stimulated activation during catheterization; b) Correlations of simultaneously obtained BSPM with spread of activation from known positioned epicardial pacemakers; c) Continued development of a normal quantified data base for P, QRS, ST-T, as well as development of maximal knowledge of BSPM's on a large number of children with varying pathology.  Correlations with Frank VCG plus M Mode and 2D Echo; d) Correlation of quantified BSPM's in adults with remote myocardial infarction undergoing cardiac catheterization involving coronary angiography and ventriculography, plus 12 lead simultaneous standard ECG, Frank VCG, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET).  (3) Image Measurements - Investigation of optimal imaging and display of BSPM data including determination of the effects of artifacts and system bandwidth upon the measurements of map features.  Develop a systematic approach to automatic measurements of the map features which encode clinical information.  (4) Biophysical Studies - a) Inverse Electrocardiography Methods for reconstructing epicardial potentials from body surface potential distributions utilizing the multipole expansion approach will be developed and tested.  The reconstructed epicardial maps will aid in the interpretations of BSPM's; b) Forward Problem - An interactive computer model of the electrocardiographic forward problem for realistic heart and torso geometry is being developed.  The model will contain the specialized conduction tissue and will generate isochrones, epicardial potentials, and body surface potential maps (BSPM's).  This model will be used to simulate BSPM's in normal and abnormal conditions and will serve as an additional tool for the interpretation of the maps.

"CANCER PROTEIN DATA BASE High resolution two dimensional electrophoresis allows a large fraction of the estimated 30,000 to 50,000 human proteins to be identified by map position and to be quantitated.  Normal and cancer cells have been mapped in orienting studies and many differences found.  To give meaning to these results, and to systematically exploit them, a large data base (the Cancer Protein Data Base) including all available and all obtainable data on each spot is required, with the data base directly linked to CRT map displays. The data base will include (for each protein) intracellular location, types of cells in which found, names, functions, disease correlations, biophysical data, literature citations, membership in coregulated sets, differentiational stage of occurrence, and chromosomal location of the coding gene.  The theses to be explored are that cells are highly integrated systems to be understood in terms of protein sets and the regulational circuits involving them, and that compositional changes in cancer cells are not random, but reflect alterations in normal regulational and differentiational functions.  This Phase I proposal is for the continued development of the TYCHO and KEPLER data base systems, specifically directed to cancer studies, in a private setting.
