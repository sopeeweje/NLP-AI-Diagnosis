"RECONSTRUCTION AND DISPLAY IN TOMOGRAPHIC RADIOLOGY This is a renewal application for a grant currently entitled ""Computer Technology for Transaxial Tomography"".  The change in title to ""Reconstruction and Display in Tomographic Radiology"" reflects a shift in the nature of the proposed work.  We propose to cover various modalities in radiology--namely, computerized tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US)--all of which are tomographic in the sense that they produce images of slices through the human body.  ""Reconstruction"" in the title of the proposal is to be interpreted as the procedure to produce such images from the measured raw data in CT, PET, and MRI.  ""Display"" in the title is to be interpreted as the procedure to put together in three-dimensional (3D)--or (including time) 4D--space the information that exists in the individual slices.  In ""reconstruction"" we plan to concentrate on finite series expansion methods, methods derived from a semi-continuous formulation, preprocessing of incomplete or distorted data, with applications to CT, PET, and MRI.  In ""display"" we plan to concentrate on segmentation (identification of structures of interest, such as specific organs and tumors, in the 3D space) and on rapid display, analysis, and manipulation of the identified structures, with applications to measurement of volumetric changes in soft-tissue masses, surgical planning, radiation therapy treatment planning, and characterization of the normal, ischemic and scarred myocardium.  In all cases computer software will be fully developed, implemented, tested, and evaluated, on the kind of computing equipment that is commonly available in radiology departments.

"3-D COMPUTERIZED ATLAS OF HUMAN BRAIN The overall objective of this project is to develop techniques and ultimately a system which will allow the rapid, objective and quantitative analysis of brain scan data obtained from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). This entails relating the scans to a computer based atlas of the human brain for objective determination of anatomic information with which to relate the functional image.  We plan to develop a system with ""user friendly software"" (e.g. simple to use by clinicians and basic researchers).  We expect that the system will be highly interactive and will provide real-time analytic feedback abilities to the user.  Techniques will be developed for the interactive display, manipulation, and image processing of 3-D data.  A 3-D Voxel representation of a standard Atlas of the human brain as well as of clinical CT, MRI or PET data will be implemented.  Image processing capabilities will include automatic thresholding, reslicing in any arbitrary plane, calculation of various statistics, and highlighting outlines or areas of interest.  The display capabilities will include real-time translation, rotation, scaling, segmentation, and enhancement of 3-D medical objects.  Interactive editing of such 3-D medical objects and the merging of multiple modalities (i.e., CT and MRI) for comparison and analysis will also be supported.
