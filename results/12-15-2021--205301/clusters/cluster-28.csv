"BIOMEDICAL USE OF PLASMA DESORPTION MASS SPECTROMETRY The specific aim of the proposed research is to continue to develop the analytical capability of 252Cf-plasma desorption mass spectrometry for biomedical research involving large biomolecules (m/z greater than 5000). Part of the plan is to change the method of sample preparation so that the formation of molecular ions from the substrate will be less dependent on matrix effects and at the same time will improve sensitivity to the picomole level.  The new method of sample preparation will utilize adsorption of proteins (insulin and cytochrome-C) onto polymeric surfaces from liquid solutions.  The interaction will be analyzed using phase equilibrium thermodynamics to evaluate equilibrium constants, DeltaH, and DeltaS for adsorption.  These same surfaces will become samples for 252Cf-PDMS analysis.  Fractional coverage will be determined by 252Cf-PDMS.  A general study of polymer-protein surface thermodynamics will be carried out using 252Cf-PDMS as an analytical method.  Two important protein systems, interferon and hemoglobin, have been targeted as the next model compounds for extending the mass range and capabilities of 252Cf-PDMS.  Some feasibility studies will be carried out to determine whether 252Cf-PDMS might be used to study antibody-antigen interactions and receptor sites on cell surfaces.  The studies of protein-polymer interactions have relevance to the genesis of atherosclerosis.  Specific interactions between proteins and receptor sites are fundamental to the immune response in humans and in understanding the role of proteins such as insulin in triggering a response within a cell when it attaches to a receptor site.

"QUANTITATION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR CONCENTRATION IN CELLS The objective of this project is to develop quantitative estrogen receptor concentration measurements using high resolution digital image microscopy techniques.  These techniques will enable direct mesurements of receptor concentration on a cell by cell basis.  This is an improvement over the current biochemical assays which only give an average value for receptor concentration.  The quantitative assay proposed for development will 1) allow for a measurement of the heterogeneity of concentration of receptors in cell populations, and 2) the proportion of cells in a tumor population that have estrogen receptor above a certain concentration level.  The recent development of monoclonal antibodies against estrogen receptor makes the development of methods for immunocytochemical localization of estrogen receptor feasible.  Additional recent advances in quantitative imaging cytology can be combined wih this to develop a fast, efficient and more accurate assay method and to eliminate the visual subjective components of the method.  This combination of these new techniques to produce a new quantitative assay is particularly important since it has already been shown that patients whose tumors contain estrogen receptors will have a higher probability of responding to hormonal therapy, and seem to have a better prognosis than patients whose tumors do not contain this receptor.

"COMPUTERIZED DENSITOMETRY OF NEUROCHEMICALS Techniques of quantitative autoradiography have been employed to gain insights to chemical mechanisms involved in the regulation of brain function.  We will refine the method of quantitative autoradiography to allow more precise assessments of neurotransmitter receptors and drug binding sites in the central nervous system (CNS).  Particular attention will be directed to the problem of quenching of tritium emissions by white matter, and we will establish criteria for introducing quench corrections in studies involving human tissue.  We will extend studies on the quantitative autoradiography of monoamine uptake sites, utilizing the antidepressant compounds desmethylimipramine and imipramine to identify, respectively, uptake sites for norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT). Studies will be conducted to examine the ontogeny of monoamine uptake sites, possible sex differences, regulation of these sites and their distribution in post-mortem human brain.  Further studies will examine monoamine receptors, and compare the distribution of monoamine uptake sites and receptors.  The ontogeny of betal and beta2 adrenergic receptors will be examined, as will the cellular location of these selective subtypes, using the selective neurotoxin ibotenic acid.  The location of putative internalized beta adrenergic receptors will also be studied.  A major new emphasis of the present proposal will be studies of possible differences in neurotransmitter receptors in post-mortem brain tissue from patients with Huntington's disease, schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness. Extensive studies will be conducted of alterations in thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and receptors for TRH in spinal tissue of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  The results of these experiments should provide important new basic information about the location and regulation of neurotransmitter receptors in rat brain, and important new clinical information about possible changes in neurotransmitter receptors in neurological and psychiatric diseases.
