"STRUCTURAL DETERMINATION OF INTERPHASE CHROMOSOMES The newly developed instrumentation and software now allows three-dimensional reconstruction, in a generalized fashion, of subcellular structures, at both the light and high voltage electron microscopic levels.  Eighteen nuclei have been reconstructed and interpreted in a quantitative fashion.  Six nuclei have their cytogenetic loci aligned with the three-dimensional structures showing that many chromosome features are three-dimensionally determined.  It is proposed to determine, three-dimensionally, many adjacent polytene nuclei in defined developmental stages and tissues so that it will be possible to see in a quantitative fashion the structural relationships. Many computational approaches are proposed to process the images, to refine the structures, to position the bands, hence genes three-dimensionally, and to determine the fine structure of nuclei.  These studies will also utilize monoclonal antibodies to localize active gene loci and their close associations one with another and the nuclear envelope, and to relate structure to function.  Diploid nuclei will, in addition, be three-dimensionally reconstructed at highest possible light microscope resolution in intact Drosophila embryos. Questions related to differences in the 3D patterns of the interphase chromosomes as a function of development, and the cell cycle will be studied.  The laboratory will continue to reconstruct mitotic chromosomes and interband/bands from polytene chromosomes from Drosophila in a resolution-overlaping fashion made possible by the three-dimensional light microscopy and much higher resolution of the high voltage electron microscope utilizing systematic high tilt about 70 degrees for three-dimensional structure.  New computational approaches to image processing in three dimensions are being continued.  New image collection hardware for the light microscopy and high voltage electron microscopy are proposed.

"ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND IMAGE ANALYSIS OF POLYOMA VIRUS Polyoma virus and its polymorphic aggregates will be studied by low-irradiation electron microscopy and image analysis to answer questions about their overall structure, assembly and stability.  Polyoma, a small DNA-containing virus, closely related to SV-40, causes transformation of embryonic or immunologically deficient mouse cells.  We have recently discovered (Rayment, Baker, Caspar and Murakami (1982) Nature 295, 110-115) that the virus capsid is composed of 72 pentameric capsomeres rather than 12 pentamers and 60 hexamers as predicted by the Caspar-Klug quasi-equivalence theory of subunit assembly.  This unexpected result prompts us to examine the packing and bonding specificity of the capsomeres in several polymorphic aggregates of polyoma using low-irradiation electron microscopy and image analysis.  These methods are the most powerful way to study biological aggregates which have not been crystallized in a form suitable for X-ray diffraction.  The molecular weights of intact virions and capsids will be determined using scanning transmission electron microscopy to provide an independent measure of the number of copies of VP1, the major coat protein.  Electron microscopy studies of positive and negatively-stained provirion complex samples will be initiated to directly observe the nucleocapsid structure and correlate with studies on intact virions, empty capsids and isolated minichromosomes.

"IMAGE ANALYSIS OF STAINED AND UNSTAINED MACROMOLECULES The structures of polyoma virus and its polymorphic aggregates, SV40 virus, myosin subfragment-1, and the chloroplast cytochrome b6/f complex will be studied by electron microscopy and image analysis methods.  These studies are aimed at answering questions about the overall structure, assembly, stability, and function of these macromolecular aggregates.  We will learn about protein-protein interactions in polyoma, SV40, myosin subfragment-1, and cytochrome b6/f, protein-nucleic acid associations in polyoma and SV40, and protein-lipid associations in cytochrome b6/f.  The biological significance of each of these systems is well documented. Polyoma and SV40 do not cause malignancies in their natural hosts (mice and rhesus monkeys), but their oncogenic potential is revealed when high concentrations of virus are injected into either foreign hosts or natural hosts lacking a functional immunological system.  Subfragment-1, the head portion of myosin, is responsible for force generation in muscle through the hydrolysis of ATP and interaction with actin.  Cytochrome b6/f, an integral membrane-spanning complex in chloroplast thylakoids, is involved in photosynthetic and respiratory energy transduction.  The potential to study these and similar structures requires continued efforts to develop and implement new techniques of electron microscopy and image analysis as well as the application of established procedures. Microscopy of frozen-hydrated specimens will help reveal the ""native"" structure of biological molecules, and implementation of highly interactive, computer graphics image analysis routines will allow flexible and efficient processing of micrographs from a greater variety of biological systems of increased complexity.
