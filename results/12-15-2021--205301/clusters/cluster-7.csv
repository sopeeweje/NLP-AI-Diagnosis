"COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISE IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is a research project that aims to develop computer-assisted instructional tools for clinical science education in medicine.  A computer system will be developed that consists of two related programs:  DSS, a user-friendly decision support system, based on the concepts of clinical decision analysis and medical cost-effectiveness analysis; and PLAN-ALYZER, an interactive critiquing system based on the concepts of automated transition networks.  Methods to be employed in the development of the system will arise from decision theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.  The primary computer system that will be used for the project is the Apple Macintosh.  The computer system will be applied to clinical problems in two content areas of second year medical education:  the workup of anemias in hematology and the evaluation and management of suspected coronary artery disease in cardiology.  Databases will be developed for each of these areas, drawing upon the resources of clinical medicine, community and family medicine, and laboratory medicine.  The effect of the computer tool in these two areas will be tested through a randomized, controlled crossover trial in three medical school classes.  Students will be stratified by sex and MCAT Verbal and Quantitative scores into two randomized groups.  The first group will undergo the hematology intervention, and serve as a control group for the cardiology exercise. The other group will serve in reverse.  Experimental subjects will undergo a laboratory exercise using the DSS and PLAN-ALYZER programs; control subjects will receive refined textual material that is equivalent in content.  Performance will be measured by patient evaluation problems built into the examination mechanism of the medical school in the randomized design.  Additionally, student performance will be measured over time, both within the second year intervention and through two repeat interventions in the clinical years of medical school.  The project aims to investigate whether computer science research in basic medical education will assist the integration of discrete medical facts into effective clinical decision making, both in the classroom environment and through clinical training.

"EVALUATION OF CORONARY DISEASE BY DIGITAL ANGIOGRAPHY The aim of this porposal is to assess the feasibility of using digital angiography to evaluate the severity of coronary artery disease. Quantitative methods to be studied will include those designed to measure anatomic coronary artery narrowing, myocardial perfusion abnormalities and segmental myocardial wall dysfunction induced by myocardial ischemia. Results will be compared to the computer-assisted method of measuring lesion dimensions from standard contrast angiograms previously developed by Brown, et al.  One quantitative method to be evaluated will involve the use of videodensitometric as well as image border methods for measuring anatomic coronary artery narrowing from digital subtraction angiograms obtained following intracoronary injection of contrast material.  Both methods will be used to measure the minimum lumen diameter (and area) of coronary artery lesions.  We also will attempt to develop less invasive methods for obtaining coronary angiograms and quantitating the severity of coronary stenosis following injection of contrast material into the aortic root.  Image processing algorithms to be evaluated in these low contrast images will include band pass filtering of electrocardiogram-gated images and a two-dimensional background interpolation method.  The accuracy of these methods will be tested in phantom, dog and clinical models.  A second general quantitative method for assessing the severity of coronary artery disease will entail evaluating myocardial perfusion using videodensitometry to generate contrast density versus time curves in myocardial regions supplied by individual coronary arteries.  Data obtained from segments of myocardium supplied by stenotic coronary arteries will be compared to data from segments supplied by non-stenotic arteries.  Studies will be performed in dogs and humans.  The third general method for evaluating coronary artery disease involves the use of digital subtraction angiography to obtain left ventricular angiograms as a means of assessing global and segmental systolic and diastolic ventricular function at rest and immediately following atrial pacing in humans.  The myocardial perfusion and segmental wall motion methods both will be related to the minimum lumen diameter of lesions in coronary arteries supplying each myocardial segment.  If successful, these studies will provide improved methods for assessing the presence and severity of coronary lesions during routine clinical evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

"LONG-TERM PLASMA EXCHANGE IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEM The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very massive reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.  The substantial decrease and improved long term control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol by RPE coupled with hypocholesterolemic drugs should amplify the preliminary evidence which has indicated that regression of early femoral atherosclerosis and nonprogression of advanced coronary lesions can be achieved by drug treatment alone in heterozygous FH.  We propose to undertake long-term (four years) RPE at two week intervals in fifteen heterozygous subjects with FH.  Pretreatment and within treatment coronary atheromatous lesions and ventricular function and perfusion will be assessed by serial quantitative, computerized coronary angiography, rest and exercise Thallium-201 perfusion studies, respectively.  The effectiveness of RPE will be judged not only by longitudinal studies of the plasma exchange group, but also in a randomized concurrent control group of subjects receiving only maximal drug therapy.  In addition, comparison will also be made against two groups of patients (historical controls) selected by Dr. John Brensike from the type II coronary intervention study recently completed at the NIH.  These patients will be selected using the same criteria for entry into this study and will have been treated with diet alone or diet plus cholestyramine.  The subjects will have undergone cardiac catheterization at the start of the study, at two years after entry, and at five years after entry.  In effect, therefore, the results of repeat coronary angiography in fifteen patients who undergo massive reductions in plasma cholesterol by REP plus maximal drug therapy will be compared to three control groups: a randomized concurrently treated group (diet plus maximal drug therapy), and two historical NIH concurrently treated groups (one with dietary treatment only, and a group on diet plus cholestyramine).

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.  The work in the proposed project will build on the extensive previous work in drug monitoring done by these investigators in the Division of Clinical Pharmacology at Stanford and at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy.  ,MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS,3442443,R18HS005263,"['physicians ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' hospital patient care ', ' drug adverse effect ', ' chemotherapy ', ' online computer ', ' computer system design /evaluation ', ' health care facility information system ', ' computer assisted medical decision making ', ' ']",AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R18,1985,227763,0.08273741225095033
"IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTITATION OF DRUGS IN BODY FLUIDS New techniques that improve the portability, selectivity, sensitivity, and economy of drug assays are important to the mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).  Recent advances in electrochemical detectors and dector arrays, portable instrument design, and applied artificial intelligence are combined in the proposed work.  The result is a low-cost, portable, and highly selective liquid chromatograph for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of drugs in body fluids.  In this Phase I SBIR research, an apparatus is assembled and tested in order to evaluate the feasibility of portable LCEC system that has exceptional analytical capabilities.  The resultant device will have a microcomputer and software to allow automated analyses and make the equipment easy to use.

"IMPROVEMENT OF DIGITAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF CORONARY ARTERIES Coronary arteriosclerosis is a leading cause of death in U.S., and it is to a large degree the presence or absence of severe coronary stenoses which determines the risk of death.  Because many patients who suffer from this disease are asymptomatic until their first attack, a safe, inexpensive diagnostic procedure for detecting coronary artery stenoses would be beneficial.  The diagnosis as currently carried out requires that a large catheter be inserted into the orifice of each artery in order to inject opaque dye to make the arteries visible with X rays.  The increased contrast sensitivity of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) permits a less invasive technique involving an injection into the aortic root, a smaller catheter, and reduced dye volumes, but it has been of only limited success largely because of image degradation caused by patient motion during image acquisition.  The aim of this project is to develop and test image processing algorithms for the improvement of digital angiography of coronary arteries.  The algorithms search for a geometrical transformation to produce an optimal registration of two images before subtraction.  They are based on a new application of the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics, a new class of transformation functions, a new method of machine calibration, and new application of search methods developed in the field of artifical intelligence for function optimization.  As a result these algorithms represent the first approach to image registration which is capable of handling true three dimensional warping.  The development and evaluation of the algorithms will be carried out on both a specially designed phantom and on data derived in a new way from patient studies. The patient studies will be acquired during angioplasty procedures in which an inflated balloon and catheter will serve as phantom arteries of known dimensions.  The availability of known phantoms located in the chest on a beating human heart will provide for the first time an opportunity for quantitative evaluation of the success of the image enhancement algorithms in a realistic environment.  Thus, the proposed research will employ new techniques of image registration with a new technique for image evaluation to the problem of reducing motion effects in digital subtraction angiography.
