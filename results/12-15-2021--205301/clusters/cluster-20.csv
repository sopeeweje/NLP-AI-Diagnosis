"FISH VENTILATORY BEHAVIOR AS A TOXIC'S MONITORING TOOL The long term objective is to develop a fish monitoring tool capable of rapidly screening chemicals for toxicity, protecting public drinking water supplies and wastewater receiving systems, and identifying the causative toxic agent(s).  Non-invasive electrode techniques receive signals from fish generated bioelectric fields.  Electronic components filter the signals generated from independently monitored fish such that the ventilatory components may be amplified and interfaced to a microcomputer. This and other laboratories have demonstrated that, upon exposure to acutely toxic chemical concentrations, several changes occur in the ventilatory components of fish, such as, frequency, amplitude, and gill purge or cough, including three major and eleven subcategories of the types of gill purge.  It is anticipated that the Phase I research will demonstrate that, upon exposure to chronically toxic chemical concentrations, the combinations of ventilatory components occurring will be unique to a given category of the chemical (e.g., concepts of structural activity relationships, heavy metal vs. pesticide, etc.).  Many chemicals that are toxic to humans and other mammilian systems are toxic to aquatic organisms.  If the long term objective is successful, this inexpensive monitoring tool would have commercal applications for the chemical manufacturing, drinking water and wastewater treatment industries, municipalities, and regulatory agencies, as well as the academic research community.

"LOW COST OCR READER FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED The objective of this research is to design and prototype a low-cost optical character recognizer (OCR) with voice output for aiding visually-impaired persons to read books, magazines, and other printed materials.  A primary objective is to design an easy-to-use device for a $1,000-$2,000 retail price.  Ways of reducing costs are design of a hand-operated machine, relaxing speed and accuracy requirements, and design with low-cost parts.  The principal methodology used will be developing the OCR algorithm with an OCR development workstation.  The workstation features rapid prototyping of segmenting and recognition strategies, and a graphical user interface.  The workstation has some of the features of the Small Talk artificial intelligence development system, and it is expected to speed up development and testing of OCR algorithms by a factor of four.  A potential commercial application is to allow the visually impaired to be more productive.  Additional commercial applications are graphics scanning and OCR input.  The wider commercial applications are expected to provide incentives to lower the price to visually-impaired individuals.  To this end, the proposer has located sources of private funds.

"NEURO-IMAGING EXPERT SYSTEM It is proposed to develop a computerized expert system for analyzing and understanding the images of the nervous system generated by neuroimaging techniques such as computerized tomography (CT).  A prototype version, called RAD (Radiologic Automatic Diagnosis), has been implemented.  RAD will serve as an expert consultant in the field of neuroradiology, as an adjunct to computerized expert systems for medical diagnosis, and as an intelligent image processor supporting automated feature extraction from neuro-images.  Modern neuroimaging techniques have revolutionized the practice of neurology and neurosurgery.  The rapid proliferation of scanners, however, has outstripped the supply of experts with special training in scan interpretation.  If a scanner could produce the differential diagnosis associated with the radiographs, it could aid radiologists in diagnostic tasks.  Images received in digitized form from scanning devices will be segmented into objects after thresholding based on radiodensity (CT scans).  This process will be aided by intelligent histogram optimizers and artifact removal programs.  Analysis will be conducted in an object-oriented programming environment on objects represented in quadtree or octree format.  RAD will employ clinical information, and knowledge bases in neuroanatomy, neuroradiology, neurology, and medicine to establish a context for analysis.  This context will be instantiated in the form of assertions on a queue of beliefs in a truth maintenance system.  Global and local image analyzers will also make assertions about neuro-images.  The truth maintenance system will keep track of any contradictions which arise, and will provide forward chaining and backtracking explanation abilities of the reasoning leading to the differential diagnosis.  At the present time, medical diagnostic expert systems, such as INTERNIST-I/CADUCEUS are dependent for its input upon the physician-user. The ability to directly interact with patient data in neuro-images would enrich the diagnostic foundation of the system and reduce obligate user interaction.

"A ROTATING SLIT SCANNING UNIT FOR DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY The purpose of the research we are proposing is the development of a rotational slit scanning system for digital radiographic applications.  The x-ray receptors will consist of linear photodiode arrays coated with an x-ray phosphor.  The system should be compact and of low cost compared to commercially available linear scanning units.  The spatial resolution imaging capabilities of such a device should exceed one 1p/mm, while offering shorter scan times than conventional linear scanning units.  The benefits expected from such a system would include:  1. significant reduction in the detection of compton scattered x-rays (which will degrade image contrast and increase dose)  2. scan rates sufficient to minimize many patient motion problems  3. an increase in the dynamic range available over that of film  4. adequate spatial resolution for many radiologic applications  Since the same coated arrays may be employed in a linear scan format, direct comparison of image quality between the two scanning formats for the same receptor technology will be possible.

"DIGITAL CONTROL OF REHABILITATION/EXERCISE MACHINES The long term objectives of this work are twofold.  First, to develop adaptive machines which can be used effectively in the evaluation and rehabilitation of muscular deficits due to traluma, disuse or disease in a broad spectrum of the population from victims of accidents and chronic musculoskeletal disorders to atheletes and the aged.  Second, to collaborate with health professionals in collecting and analyzing data, using the unique capabilities of these devices, and to establish a database to make these data readily accessible.  Thus, these machines should be versatile, incorporating active as well as passive exercise capacity, and capable of collecting, archiving, manipulating and comparing quantitative measurements from treatment protocols.  The specific aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an intelligent, digital controller, based upon computer architecture widely used and supported in the industrial process control and biomedical communities.  The controller must be capable of accurate, on-line, feedback regulation of previously developed instrumented machines.  The latter permit motion in three dimensions and employ electrohydraulic control of resistance.  To accomplish this specific aim, several steps are required.  Initially, the dynamic performance of the electrohydraulic actuator unit must be characterized using standard control engineering test protocols.  Next, a prototype test system can be assembled by interfacing a minicomputer with one of the instrumented machines and allowing the computer to emulate digital controller functions.  By varying such parameters as sampling rate, data precision and feedback functions, software/hardware constraints will be established.  Finally, a configuration will be outlined specifying the requisite hardware and software components which will provide acceptable control performance.

"TEXTSKIMER:  A HANDHELD READER FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED There is a great need for an economical reading machine for use by blind and visually impaired people.  A unique device, incorporating a handheld scanner and associated character recognition logic and allow users to input hardcopy text to computer files for general use and output through a voice synthesizer or braille output device.  The handheld scanncer is robust enough to be used even by blind persons. This is made possible by a high scanning window (1 inch) and a unique patented velocity compensation circuit.  The high scanning window also allows automatic format analysis, not available in any other machine currently available.  Other patented techniques incorporated in this device enable the reading of very poor quality text and is inherently font-insensitive.  The cost of the machine is projected to be less than $2,000.
