"CUTANEOUS PATTERN PERCEPTION The proposed research will investigate the skin's ability to perceive tactile patterns.  Using a vibrotactile array of stimulators that fit against the subjects' fingertips, complex patterns varying in duration, mode of generation, intensity, size, temporal proximity to masking stimuli, and location will be presented to subjects who are required to identify the patterns.  The role of pattern onset in generating vibrotactile contours and the limits of temporal integration of vibrotactile patterns will be investigated.  Measurements will be made of temporal masking functions with patterned stimuli, and a two-factor model of masking will be tested. Spatial factors such as the locus of stimulation and the size of patterns as well as the interaction between these factors and temporal and intensive variables will be explored.  The role of experience in tactile pattern recognition will be examined by testing individuals who have had extensive experience with the Optacon, a reading aid for the blind, with some of the pattern recognition tasks on which sighted subjects have been tested.  The project will be concerned with drawing parallels between tactile and visual pattern perception.  The project will also be concerned with the improvement of cutaneous communication systems and devices, particularly as these might be used by individuals with sensory handicaps.

"THE ROLE OF THE HAPTIC SYSTEM IN COMMUNICATION The major research effort in this project is directed at the fundamental problem of the processing of complex tactile stimulus patterns in real-time for use as correlates of environmental information by handicapped or normal persons working under a sensory overload. To determine what characteristics of patterns provide reliable and rapidly processed units of information, a computer-controlled vibrotactile matrix has been constructed to permit presentation of a wide variety of frequencies, amplitudes, and time relations of tactile stimuli over a spatial display of 64 independently controlled vibrators.  Present explorations of promising pattern dimensions involve serial presentations of patterns for discrimination and identification, but future work will involve pattern production and modification in dynamic simulated environmental representations.  A variety of basic problems that have appeared as by-products of the main effort also receive attention, viz., threshold and ""loudness"" summation in the presence of multiple contactors, spatial mislocalizations as space-time trade-offs, judgments of texture and distance on the skin, and the influence of mechanical skin characteristics on basic psychophysical functions.

"CUTANEOUS PATERN PERCEPTION The proposed research will investigate the perception of tactile patterns by human subjects.  The tactile patterns will be generated on arrays of stimulators that fit against the subject's fingertips.  Each array consists of 144 stimulators arranged in a matrix 6 columns by 24 rows.  Sets of patterns differing along such dimensions as location, intensity, number of line segments, and so forth will be generated and presented to subjects. Response measures will include identification, discrimination, reaction time, and pattern matching.  Three aspects of tactile pattern perception will be examined:  masking, interactions among multiple sites of stimulation, and the role of experience.  A temporal masking paradigm will be used to see how the perception of tactile patterns is interfered with by tactile maskers and how the nature of the interference changes with changes in the type of masker and in the temporal separation between target and masker.  In the studies of interaction among multiple sites, patterns will be presented to as many as three sites on the fingertips and palm.  This paradigm will be used to assess the role of attention in tactile information processing. The role of short-term experience will be examined by measuring changes in pattern perception as subjects learn to identify and discriminate tactile patterns.  The effect of long-term experience will be evaluated by comparing the performance of groups of subjects who differ in the amount and nature of their experience with complex tactile patterns.  One group will be Optacon users, blind individuals who can read by means of a tactile array.  The other groups will be blind individuals without Optacon experience and several groups of sighted subjects with varying amounts of tactile experience.  The proposed research will be concerned with drawing parallels between tactile processing and visual and auditory processing, with developing measures relevant to understanding the neural coding of tactile patterns, and with improving cutaneous communication systems for the blind, deaf, and deaf-blind.
