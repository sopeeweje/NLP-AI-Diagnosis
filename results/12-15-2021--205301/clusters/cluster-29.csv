"STRUCTURE DETERMINATION BY TRIPLE QUAD MASS SPECTROMETRY The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate and develop techniques for the application of the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in the determination of molecular structure.  In triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (TQMS), ions from the source are selected by mass in the first quadrupole and then undergo fragmenting or reactive collision(s) with neutral molecules in the non mass-selective center quadrupole.  The ionic collision products are then mass-analysed by the third quadrupole before detection.  This is a form mass spectrometry (MS/MS).  With TQMS or MS/MS, one can obtain a spectrum for every ""parent"" ion produced in the source. This three-dimensional collection of spectra contains much more information about the sample than the oridinary mass spectrum.  It is a goal of this proposal to deduce the structural information contained in these spectra by comparison of the daughter spectra with those from a large number of compounds with known and varied structure.  The proposed research includes four areas:  1) a continuation of our effort to identify the structural information contained in the variations in daughter spectra with changes in ion internal energy, ion kinetic energy, and collision gas pressure and to identify reasonable and reproducible ""standard"" conditions for the collection of spectra for a data base library, 2) the development of searching and ranking procedures which will produce lists of compounds in the data base that produce ions that give daughter spectra similar to those of the unknown compound.  3) The development of algorithms to identify from the lists of compounds, those common substructures which might be part of the unknown compound and from them produce a list of possible structures, and 4) make certain improvements in the instrumentation and data base management software to facilitate the above goals.  Efficient organic structural analysis is a major need among synthetic, environmental and pharaceutical chemists as well as toxicologists and pathologists.

"STRUCTURE DETERMINATION BY TRIPLE QUAD MASS SPECTROMETRY The goal of this research is to develop the full capability of tandem mass spectrometry for routine organic structure determination.  In tandem mass spectrometry, or MS/MS, ions from the source are selected by the first mass analyzer and then undergo fragmenting collision with neutral molecules in a collision region.  The ionic products of the collision process are then mass analyzed by a second mass filter and ion detector.  The special potential offered by MS/MS for structure determination comes from the individual fragmentation spectrum available for each ion in the normal mass spectrum.  Each ion species in the source is related to some substructure of the original molecule and the identity of each of these species can be deduced from its fragmentation spectrum.  The direct correlation of ion fragmentation spectra with precursor substructures is only one of many types of structural information available in the overall MS/MS molecular fragmentation map.  To make this potentially powerful technique generally useful, it is necessary to extend the knowledge base to known relationships between MS/MS spectral features and substructures, to obtain the molecular structure from the identified substructures, and to automate the entire process from instrument control to final structure output.  To accomplish this, we propose to utilize a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (TWMS) MS/MS instrument, spectrum and structure databases designed for MS/MS applications, and spectrum matching functions linked to these databases.  These existing and available functions will be combined with an intelligent controller and expert systems for matching, generating, and organizing structures.  The goal is an automated system for the determination of molecular structure.  This system will be used in semi-automatic mode to extend the spectra/substructure knowledge base.  In measurement mode, the intelligent controller will direct the measurement process to acquire the data most likely to resolve the remaining structural uncertainties.  This project combines the fields of organic mass spectrometry, instrumentation, and artificial intelligence.  It is relevant to health-related research because of its potential to determine complex structures (and therefore the complete identity) of previously unknown compounds, detect particular sought substructures in various materials or mixtures, and do so using only micrograms of sample.
