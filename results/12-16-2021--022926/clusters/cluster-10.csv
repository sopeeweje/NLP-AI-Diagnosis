"DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL HEARING FOR THE DEAF The effort to develop artificial hearing systems for the deaf has recently been focussed on tactual vocoders, devices that transduce acoustic energy into vibratory or electrocutaneous signals which are then applied to the skin.  Current tactual vocoders, however, are based largely upon untested assumptions about optimal filter configurations for speech processing.  In a study which carefully controls device variables (through use of software filters and computer driven displays) while systematically varying filter configurations, perception of critical features of the speech code will be studied.  Using psychophysical techniques, the research seeks to describe the tactual perception of speech features based on signals processed through filter banks with linear, logarithmic and composite spacings for both 32 and 16 channel displays.  The studies will:  1. determine discrimination and identification of speech contrasts along various speech-simulating continua for each of the filter configurations;  2. provide an empirical basis for the design of tactual vocoders with optimal filter configurations; and  3. lay the foundations for a miniaturized tactual vocoder design to be implemented in succeeding phases of the work.  This work is directed toward the development and ultimate manufacture of a portable, wearable, cosmetically acceptable, artificial hearing prosthesis for the deaf.

"AN INTERACTIVE BIOMEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSOR/ANALYZER Current morphometry and image analysis systems can be broadly divided into those which display an image and require the user to trace the points or lines considered significant and those which apply complex algorithms to locate significant objects autonomously.  We have developed a prototype of an intermediate type of system in which the user can rapidly indicate the approximate location of significant objects after which the system applies an edge following algorithm to determine the exact boundary of the object. This system will be much faster to use than ""dumb"" morphometry systems and much less costly than ""intelligent"" image analyzers costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.  This system uses a new VLSI microprocessor specialized for signal processing tasks and innovative image processing circuitry we have designed.  We believe we can design a system of this type to sell for approximately $10,000.  This would bring powerful image processing technology within the reach of many more investigators.

"PHASE II RESEARCH ON SOUND-MAKING PRODUCTS FOR INFANTS The visual ""mobiles"" attached to infant cribs are devices designed to provide the infant with visual stimulation.  There are no devices currently on the market that provide infants with complex and interesting auditory stimulation.  Yet, studies by this research team show that very young infants have a keen sense of hearing and are capable of discriminating fine differences in complex sounds such as speech.  More importantly, our work suggests that infants like listening to speech, particularly when it conforms to the kind of speech that is addressed to them by caretakers. The particular kind of speech has many special properties, and has been given the name ""Motherese.""  Our laboratory research indicates that infants prefer to listen to Motherese over the kind of speech that is addressed to adults.  Moreover, the work shows that the main feature attracting infant attention towards Motherese is its unique acoustic characteristics, indluding an increase in pitch, exaggerated pitch contours, and a slower tempo.  This Phase-I research project proposes to examine the feasibility of creating an ""Auditory Mobile"" for infants--a device that presents Motherese and other complex signals that mimic its salient acoustic characteristics to infants.  The special features of this device include the fact that it is programmable and activated by the infant's vocalizations.  The proposal requests support for research that would further specify the parameters of auditory signals that should be contained in an Auditory Mobile and begin work on the technical problems of speech synthesis and recognition required by the device.

"FISH VENTILATORY BEHAVIOR AS A TOXIC'S MONITORING TOOL The long term objective is to develop a fish monitoring tool capable of rapidly screening chemicals for toxicity, protecting public drinking water supplies and wastewater receiving systems, and identifying the causative toxic agent(s).  Non-invasive electrode techniques receive signals from fish generated bioelectric fields.  Electronic components filter the signals generated from independently monitored fish such that the ventilatory components may be amplified and interfaced to a microcomputer. This and other laboratories have demonstrated that, upon exposure to acutely toxic chemical concentrations, several changes occur in the ventilatory components of fish, such as, frequency, amplitude, and gill purge or cough, including three major and eleven subcategories of the types of gill purge.  It is anticipated that the Phase I research will demonstrate that, upon exposure to chronically toxic chemical concentrations, the combinations of ventilatory components occurring will be unique to a given category of the chemical (e.g., concepts of structural activity relationships, heavy metal vs. pesticide, etc.).  Many chemicals that are toxic to humans and other mammilian systems are toxic to aquatic organisms.  If the long term objective is successful, this inexpensive monitoring tool would have commercal applications for the chemical manufacturing, drinking water and wastewater treatment industries, municipalities, and regulatory agencies, as well as the academic research community.

"ARRAY PROCESSOR FOR MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING A powerful array processor to be attached to our existing VAX 11/780 computer is requested.  This instrument will be dedicated to research in medical imaging and image processing.  Specifically, four projects are proposed, two each in digital radiology and nuclear medicine.  In digital radiology, the goal of the proposed research is to deblur subtraction angiograms by using sophisticated image processing algorithms, thereby facilitating the visualization of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries.  Two distinct processing algorithms will be investigated.  Both of these algorithms are well known in the image processing leterature, but have not yet been applied to large medical images for lack of sufficient computer power.  The nuclear medicine projects have as their goal earlier detection and more accurate characterization of small neoplasms.  In one of these projects, three-dimensional images will be reconstructed from coded-aperture data.  This approach allows true tomographic reconstruction without any motion of the detector or aperture.  The other nuclear medicine project involves automated feature extraction and pattern recognition of liver scans.  In addition, it will include an attempt to optimize the design of nuclear imaging systems for most accurate extraction of the relevant features.

"NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE ANALYSIS We will use a combination of computer programming and biochemistry to study some interesting questions in molecular biology.  Our nucleic-acid sequence library system will be improved to allow the user the powers of recombinant DNA technology available to the biochemist.  All of our software will be extensively modularized to facilitate program development and transportation, both of which will hasten improvements.  We will continue to expand our collection of programs to analyze sequence-function relationships.  This will include improvements to our program of a pattern recognition algorithm (the ""perceptron"") and adaptations of multiple regression analyses to nucleic-acid sequence problems.  These techniques will be used to make quantitative models for sequence effects on promoter efficiency and mutagenicity.

"COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISE IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is a research project that aims to develop computer-assisted instructional tools for clinical science education in medicine.  A computer system will be developed that consists of two related programs:  DSS, a user-friendly decision support system, based on the concepts of clinical decision analysis and medical cost-effectiveness analysis; and PLAN-ALYZER, an interactive critiquing system based on the concepts of automated transition networks.  Methods to be employed in the development of the system will arise from decision theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.  The primary computer system that will be used for the project is the Apple Macintosh.  The computer system will be applied to clinical problems in two content areas of second year medical education:  the workup of anemias in hematology and the evaluation and management of suspected coronary artery disease in cardiology.  Databases will be developed for each of these areas, drawing upon the resources of clinical medicine, community and family medicine, and laboratory medicine.  The effect of the computer tool in these two areas will be tested through a randomized, controlled crossover trial in three medical school classes.  Students will be stratified by sex and MCAT Verbal and Quantitative scores into two randomized groups.  The first group will undergo the hematology intervention, and serve as a control group for the cardiology exercise. The other group will serve in reverse.  Experimental subjects will undergo a laboratory exercise using the DSS and PLAN-ALYZER programs; control subjects will receive refined textual material that is equivalent in content.  Performance will be measured by patient evaluation problems built into the examination mechanism of the medical school in the randomized design.  Additionally, student performance will be measured over time, both within the second year intervention and through two repeat interventions in the clinical years of medical school.  The project aims to investigate whether computer science research in basic medical education will assist the integration of discrete medical facts into effective clinical decision making, both in the classroom environment and through clinical training.

"EVALUATION OF CORONARY DISEASE BY DIGITAL ANGIOGRAPHY The aim of this porposal is to assess the feasibility of using digital angiography to evaluate the severity of coronary artery disease. Quantitative methods to be studied will include those designed to measure anatomic coronary artery narrowing, myocardial perfusion abnormalities and segmental myocardial wall dysfunction induced by myocardial ischemia. Results will be compared to the computer-assisted method of measuring lesion dimensions from standard contrast angiograms previously developed by Brown, et al.  One quantitative method to be evaluated will involve the use of videodensitometric as well as image border methods for measuring anatomic coronary artery narrowing from digital subtraction angiograms obtained following intracoronary injection of contrast material.  Both methods will be used to measure the minimum lumen diameter (and area) of coronary artery lesions.  We also will attempt to develop less invasive methods for obtaining coronary angiograms and quantitating the severity of coronary stenosis following injection of contrast material into the aortic root.  Image processing algorithms to be evaluated in these low contrast images will include band pass filtering of electrocardiogram-gated images and a two-dimensional background interpolation method.  The accuracy of these methods will be tested in phantom, dog and clinical models.  A second general quantitative method for assessing the severity of coronary artery disease will entail evaluating myocardial perfusion using videodensitometry to generate contrast density versus time curves in myocardial regions supplied by individual coronary arteries.  Data obtained from segments of myocardium supplied by stenotic coronary arteries will be compared to data from segments supplied by non-stenotic arteries.  Studies will be performed in dogs and humans.  The third general method for evaluating coronary artery disease involves the use of digital subtraction angiography to obtain left ventricular angiograms as a means of assessing global and segmental systolic and diastolic ventricular function at rest and immediately following atrial pacing in humans.  The myocardial perfusion and segmental wall motion methods both will be related to the minimum lumen diameter of lesions in coronary arteries supplying each myocardial segment.  If successful, these studies will provide improved methods for assessing the presence and severity of coronary lesions during routine clinical evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

"ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS IN OCULAR INFLAMMATORY DISEASE The major goals of this proposal are the prevention of blindness and of morbidity associated with inflammatory eye diseases, particularly trachoma and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.  In the studies of trachoma, we will (1) develop improved techniques for treating it, (2) elucidate the role of Chlamydia trachomatis as an agent of systemic illness, particularly childhood pneumonia, in trachoma endemic areas, (3) evaluate new techniques for the rapid, inexpensive diagnosis of chlamydial infections, (4) attempt to further define the immunological response to C. trachomatis infections in trachoma through the use of specific chlamydial antigens.  The hypothesis underlying these studies is that blindness and morbidity associated with endemic trachoma can be prevented, but that will involve new technologies for detection and treatment.  While these studies on ocular chlamydial infection will be directed at practical, applied goals, we also will examine at a basic level the pathogenesis of chronic trachoma.  By defining the antibody response to specific chlamydial antigens and the patterns of cellular response in the eye, we plan to develop a means to identify cases who are at risk of the blinding complications or who will not respond well to chemotherapy.  This knowledge will be needed as a basis for the evaluation of possible subunit trachoma vaccines.  The studies on ocular herpes simplex virus infections will focus on improving the management of this condition by the development of a computer based, artificial intelligence model of HSV eye infections that can be used as an expert consultant for management of herpetic eye disease.  Continued development of this model will elucidate specific problems in the complex management of the disease.

"DERIVING KNOWLEDGE FROM CLINICAL DATABASES The major concern of the RX Project is with the development of tools for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of health care data. Specifically, the objectives of the project are 1) to increase the validity and ease of data analysis and interpretation and 2) to facilitate the process of hypothesis generation and preliminary confirmation.  The principal focus of our research will continue to be on the RX Study Module.  Utilizing an on-line knowledge base of clinical medicine and of statistical procedures, the Study Module is designed to assist a researcher with the task of creating a comprehensive, mathematically correct study design using appropriate data from a large clinical database.  The Study Module determines an overall study design choosing between cross-sectional and longitudinal methods, it determines significant confounding variables and methods for controlling them, it determines patient eligibility criteria, and it formulates a mathematical model for testing the hypothesis.  Finally, the Study Module automatically runs the study design on a statistical package and assists with the interpretation of results.  A second focus of our work is in methods for aiding hypothesis generation. We seek to facilitate this process by developing improved means for labeling and accessing patient records.  We are also interested in developing methods for automating the dicovery of hypotheses by using methods from the field of artificial intelligence.  Our method will use a medical knowledge base to focus the search for promising hypotheses.  Our planned research for all these endeavors will build on our present algorithms and the current RX prototype.

"PHOTOINDUCED THROMBOTIC STROKE--MECHANISMS AND THERAPY The major goal of this project is to document patterns of platelet deposition, blood flow and edema during the development of focal thrombotic stroke, and the effects of prophylactic agents on mitigating or inhibiting thrombus formation in brain vasculature.  A secondary goal is to determine whether lipid peroxidation is associated with thrombotic stroke, and to characterize the distribution of lipid peroxides in parenchyma and endothelium of the affected tissue zone and correlate this with morphological indices as the stroke progresses.  The proposed studies will utilize our recently characterized model of reproducible focal cerebral infarction precipitated by photochemically induced thrombosis of cortical vasculature, in rats injected systemically with the potent photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal.  The progression of thrombosis will be represented by platelets radiolabeled with IIIindium, and local cerebral blood flow will be evaluated by 14C-labeled iodoantipyrine imaging.  Microvascular occlusion will be visualized directly by carbon-black perfusion.  The effect on these parameters of agents known to mitigate thrombosis of single vessels in vivo will be evaluated in the present context of a network of occluded vasculature; such agents include calcium channel antagonists (nimodipine, nifedipine, verapamil), antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, indomethacin, prostacyclin), free radical scavengers (ethanol, dimethylsufoxide, glycerol) and the clot-specific fibrinolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA).  Enhancement of the effect of t-PA by prior administration of lys-plasminogen will be tested also.  The hypothesis that lipid peroxidation inhibits the recovery of tissue compromised by ischemia can be studied if lipid peroxide formation can be induced in specific tissue zones.  In this model it is likely that platelet adhesion and subsequent aggregation are stimulated by photochemical peroxidation of endothelial lipids.  Owing to the reproducible progression of blood flow deficit in the photoinduced lesion, the present model may facilitate stable conditions for lipid peroxidation, observable as conjugated dienes, in the parenchyma as well.  The relative content (predicted to be low) of endothelial lipid peroxides, and the efficiency of photochemical induction of endothelial defects will be determined by similar experiments conducted with endothelial cells in culture.  The proposed work enables rigorous study of the thrombotic process and its mitigation under well-controlled condition in brain microvessels, with consequent benefit to potential stroke patients.

"ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND IMAGE ANALYSIS OF POLYOMA VIRUS Polyoma virus and its polymorphic aggregates will be studied by low-irradiation electron microscopy and image analysis to answer questions about their overall structure, assembly and stability.  Polyoma, a small DNA-containing virus, closely related to SV-40, causes transformation of embryonic or immunologically deficient mouse cells.  We have recently discovered (Rayment, Baker, Caspar and Murakami (1982) Nature 295, 110-115) that the virus capsid is composed of 72 pentameric capsomeres rather than 12 pentamers and 60 hexamers as predicted by the Caspar-Klug quasi-equivalence theory of subunit assembly.  This unexpected result prompts us to examine the packing and bonding specificity of the capsomeres in several polymorphic aggregates of polyoma using low-irradiation electron microscopy and image analysis.  These methods are the most powerful way to study biological aggregates which have not been crystallized in a form suitable for X-ray diffraction.  The molecular weights of intact virions and capsids will be determined using scanning transmission electron microscopy to provide an independent measure of the number of copies of VP1, the major coat protein.

"PROTEIN MARKERS OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA The molecular events associated with the development of renal cell carcinoma are essentially unknown and useful biochemical markers for this tumor are not available.  High-resolution protein separation techniques have been used in preliminary experiments to identify a group of proteins which are associated with the tumor, but absent or significantly reduced in normal renal cortex.  This application has as its long-term objective the understanding of the role these proteins play in the expression of the malignant phenotype and the determination of whether serum, urine, or tissue assays for these proteins are of clinical relevance.  The first specific aim of this proposal concerns the production of monoclonal antibodies to these proteins through the immunization of mice with protein spots cut from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, a recently developed technique.  The second aim deals with the use of these antibodies to help isolate and characterize the proteins as to molecular weight, subunit composition, glycosylation, cellular localization, and tissue specificity. These studies will use two-dimensional electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, and immunohistochemical staining.  The third specific aim deals with the evaluation of three established renal cell carcinoma-derived cell lines as model systems.  Quantitative computer-aided pattern analysis will be used to compare two-dimensional gels of the cultured cells and tumor tissue, and immunologic methods will also be used to confirm the presence or absence of the carcinoma-associated proteins in the cultured cells.  Specific aim four will be to determine by immunoassay if any of the carcinoma-associated proteins or circulating antibodies to these proteins are present in the serum of patients with this tumor.  If so, preliminary studies will be initiated to determine the potential clinical usefulness for the detection, staging, or typing of renal tumors.  The studies outlined here should provide fundamental information about the biochemistry, cell biology, and clinical chemistry of a group of proteins associated with renal cell carcinoma and provide the necessary tools and information to pursue one or several of these proteins in greater detail in the future.

"PRIMATE CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall, long range objectives are to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the marmoset family (Callitrichidae), in social and sexual communication.  The scent marks of these primates encode messages on identify of species, subspecies, and individual as well as information relating to sexual and social status.  Scent mark material, a mixture of gland secretion, some urine and possibly genital discharge, is chemically complex and includes esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and hydrocarbons.  To date our analytical studies using high resolution capillary gas chromatography have not revealed any qualitative differences in the scent marks of animals which differ in their sex, subspecies or species.  Therefore, we have embarked on a study to evaluate quantitative differences in the scent mark constituents.  Studies are proposed to identify the concentration profiles of the components which define gender, subspecies and species.  Analysis by computerized pattern recognition techniques will target those components which are correlated with gender, subspecies and species.  Sophisticated GC/MS/DS instrumentation will then be employed as the major tool for identification and quantitation of the targeted components.  Their role in chemical communication will be tested by behavioral assay.  Bacterial studies will also be undertaken to establish the role of microbial action in the production of some of the highly volatile components.  Finally, studies aimed at the identification of previously unknown components of lower volatility will be carried out.  We anticipate that this research will eventually lead to a deciphering of the chemical code such that in the end it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations the wide variety of communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and a bacteriologist has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.  These studies follow logically from prior work of our laboratory.  To the best of our knowledge this research program, involving the very close collaboration of chemists, primatologists and bacteriologists to explore and define a chemical communication system in a primate species, is unique in the United States.

"VISUOMOTOR COORDINATION:  NEURAL NETWORKS AND SCHEMAS Our approach to analyzing mechanisms of visuomotor coordination is two-fold:  ""top-down"", to offer a coordinated control program of interacting schemas (concurrently active programs suitably structured for action-perception systems) to model behavior noted by neuroethologists; and ""bottom-up"", to provide detailed models of neural networks which are consistent with known anatomy and physiology, but which involve additional assumptions, amenable to experimental test, to yield a network capable of exhibiting appropriate behavior.  Where possible, we implement a family of models, rather than a single model, to facilitate computer experiments and animal experiments which may discriminate between alternative mechanisms.

"ANALYSIS OF Z BANDS IN HEART BY OPTICAL DIFFRACTION In human cardiocytes, the contractile units are linked together by Z bands. Although specific proteins have been localized in Z band regions of some vertebrate muscles, the organization of these proteins into a filament lattice is unknown.  Z bands vary in width but the functional significance of this variation remains obscure.  Using optical diffraction methods we have been able to analyze Z and bands greater than 90 nm wide in mammalian cardiac and slow skeletal muscle and have identified a common structural unit.  Our optical reconstruction studies show that these units are added side-to-side and end-to-end to make a regular arrangement of axial and connecting filaments. However, the entire Z band is rarely a uniform lattice.  Optical reconstructions strongly suggest variation in the arrangement of connecting filaments in the Z band at rest length and suggest that the Z band is a dynamic structure.  Our purpose in these studies is to further determine the organization of Z band components in both normal and widened Z bands and to relate this organization to proposed functions for Z bands.  A systematic approach for Z band analysis using goniometer tilt and stereo techniques for electron microscopy at standard and high voltages, together with optical diffraction and reconstruction methods, will be continued.  We will expand our multilevel approach to include studies of Z bands 1)  in normal muscle fixed after repeated stimulation and after fatigue; 2)  in normal muscle partially extracted and reconstituted; 3)  in isolated myofibrils or Z disc sheets and in developing muscle.  Additional techniques to be used are computerized image processing, protein isolation and separation and antibody localization.  Structural analysis of Z bands in normal and developing muscle should contribute to our understanding of muscle cell function.

"MASS SPECTROMETRY IN ORGANIC AND BIOCHEMISTRY The application of various mass spectrometric techniques to structure elucidation of three classes of biologically important natural products will be studied.  The first group encompasses novel marine sterols, which differ primarily from terrestrial sterols in the nature of their unusual (elongated or branched) side chains.  This feature appears to be of importance in cell membrane function and a detailed knowledge of the mass spectral fragmentation pattern of such sterol types is needed for structural elucidation of novel and as yet unidentified sterols of marine organisms.  Much of this work requires synthesis of requisite sterol reference compounds or synthetic verification of postulated structure.  The second group of natural products deals with the unusual phospholipids isolated from marine organisms.  Much less is known about the mass spectrometric behavior of this biologically important class of natural products as compared to sterols, and we intend to explore this field in detail by comparing different ionization techniques (electron impact vs. field desorption vs. chemical ionization vs. fast atom bombardment) since each is likely to provide special structural information on specific portions of the phospholipid molecule.  Since the novel marine phospholipids are particularly unusual in the context of their unprecedented fatty acid components (usually polyunsaturated), work is also envisaged on the mass spectrometric location of such double bonds in long-chain fatty acids.  Finally, we intend to develop mass spectral procedures (notably through the use of chemical ionization mass spectrometry with hydrogen gas) in the porphyrin field with the aim of accomplishing an as yet largely unrealized goal, namely the location of chemical substituents in the four different pyrrole rings of the prophyrin molecule solely through the use of mass spectrometry.  If successful, this should not only make an important contribution to porphyrin chemistry, but should also help greatly in drug metabolism studies involving cytochrome P-450.

"AUTOMATED CANCER CELL DIAGNOSIS BY THE TICAS METHOD The goal of this research is to study high-resolution image analysis of cervical cells for diagnostic assessment of patients.  The discovery of the marker features for the presence of dysplasia or malignant disease expressed in ""normal appearing"" intermediate cells from the ectocervix has affected the very strategy of prescreening for cervical cancer.  If confirmed on a large database of patients, the finding of frank tumor cells could be replaced by the statistical assessment of a limited sample of a patient's intermediate cells to ascertain whether visual review of the patient's sample is required.  Complementing the analysis of marker features in cells coming from normal patients, patients with dysplasia, with carcinoma in situ, and with invasive cancer, a new technique has been developed to measure the ploidy of cells appearing in Papanicolaou smears and histological sections.  It appears that the rapid availability of this new kind of information may add significant, new prognostic dimensions to the diagnostic techniques being developed.  The statistical distribution of the DNA content in individual nuclei has been shown to be significantly correlated with the malignancy of tumors and the patient prognosis.  The high-resolution technique for ploidy measurement is proven to be precise, accurate, and fast.  We have now completed the measurement of 50 cases designated as either dysplastic or having carcinoma in situ.  For each case, this involves the collection of:  (1)\intermediate blue cell images from vaginal, cervical, and endocervical smear preparations; (2)\dysplastic cell images from dysplasia cases; (3)\carcinoma in situ cell images from carcinoma in situ cases; (4)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from the cytology preparations; and (5)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from histological specimens obtained by biopsy.

"CUTANEOUS PATTERN PERCEPTION The proposed research will investigate the skin's ability to perceive tactile patterns.  Using a vibrotactile array of stimulators that fit against the subjects' fingertips, complex patterns varying in duration, mode of generation, intensity, size, temporal proximity to masking stimuli, and location will be presented to subjects who are required to identify the patterns.  The role of pattern onset in generating vibrotactile contours and the limits of temporal integration of vibrotactile patterns will be investigated.  Measurements will be made of temporal masking functions with patterned stimuli, and a two-factor model of masking will be tested. Spatial factors such as the locus of stimulation and the size of patterns as well as the interaction between these factors and temporal and intensive variables will be explored.  The role of experience in tactile pattern recognition will be examined by testing individuals who have had extensive experience with the Optacon, a reading aid for the blind, with some of the pattern recognition tasks on which sighted subjects have been tested.

"IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON INDUSTRIAL INSPECTOR STRESS The objective of this research is to determine how both human stress and human performance vary with the level of automation in an industrial inspection job.  Industry is demanding higher quality of its workers and of its inspectors who are charged with maintaining and monitoring that quality.  At the same time, sophisticated automation is becoming available to extend the human inspector's capabilities on some tasks within the inspection job.  Inspection is known to be a stressful job and, with these two trends, a job which is likely to increase in stressfulness.  A machine, called a Color Video Comparator or CVC, will be used to obtain six levels of inspection automation from unaided human inspection through automated display, sequencing and pacing to a pattern-recognition algorithm.  Performance and task stress will be measured in a laboratory task of inspection printed circuit boards for eight subjects at each level of automation.  The procedure follows one already performed successfully at one level for the Western Electric Company.  This company will supply the CVC and the circuit boards used in the study.  Parts of the laboratory study will be replicated using inspectors at two Western Electric plants so that differences between task stress and job stress can be measured.  The results of the project will be of value to designers of automated and semi-automated systems as they will help to specify the level of automation which gives the best balance between system performance and operator stress.

"PROCESSOR CONTROLLED HEARING AID The long term objective of the proposed program is the development, design and manufacture of a signal processor-controlled hearing aid to maintain the overall sound pressure level (SPL) and the spectrum at the eardrum within optimum limits for the hearing impaired individual for allexpected input spectra and input levels.  An additional feature will be an increase in signal-to-noise ratio of the aided signal.  The signal processing will be based on the actual eardrum SPL, determined from an acoustic feedback signal obtained by a microphone or probe in the ear canal.  For all expected input levels, the spectrum of the eardrum sound pressure is controlled by the processor, so that the peak SPL in any 1/3-octave interval does not exceed the individual's loudness discomfort level (LDL) while still maintaining the desired spectrum and SPL at its most effective value.  The processor compares the inputs and outputs for each filter and the gain in each channel is then adjusted (on a real time basis) to obtain the desired output for the band.  Determination of averaging times for both the input and output signals are significant and will constitute a major element in the study.

"NEUTROPHIL AND ENDOTHELIAL/EPITHELIAL CELL INTERACTIONS Inflammatory reactions in the airways involve emigration of neutrophils across the blood vessel endothelium and then across the pulmonary epithelium.  It is hypothesized that this inflammatory cell accumulation can lead to altered airway reactivity.  Stimulated neutrophils can produce epithelial injury and/or increased permeability which may provide better access for antigens, mediators, and/or irritants to neuronal and/or humoral trigger mechanisms in the airway.  In this project we will examine the mechanisms involved in four aspects of neutrophils emigration and epithelial injury:  (1) adherence of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium, (2) transendothelial migration, (3) transepithelial migration, and (4) epithelial injury by neutrophils activated on the apical side of the epithelium.  We will used cell culture techniques to study endothelial cells from large vessels and from the microvasculature and epithelial cells from alveoli and large airways.  For many of the studies we will use human neutrophils and human endothelial and epithelial cells.  Adherence will be assayed with radiolabeled neutrophils and with video microscopy with computer assisted image analysis.  Migration will be studied in standard chemotactic chambers and in specially designed horizontal and vertical chambers for measurement of bioelectric properties of the monolayers and their permeability.  Questions to be addressed include the following:   Are there specific sites or macromolecules on endothelial cells or epithelial cells to which neutrophils attach?  Do endothelial cells or epithelial cells produce factors which increase or decrease adherence?  Do neutrophils alter the barrier properties of endothelial and epithelial monolayers during migration?  Our central hypothesis is that endothelial cells and epithelial cells play an active role in neutrophil emigration,and once we know the mechanism for this facilitated movement, new pharmacologic strategies for control of inflammation may be possible.  The mechanism of neutrophil adherence and migration should also be applicable to other inflammatory lung diseases such as pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome.

"A ROTATING SLIT SCANNING UNIT FOR DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY The purpose of the research we are proposing is the development of a rotational slit scanning system for digital radiographic applications.

The spatial resolution imaging capabilities of such a device should exceed one 1p/mm, while offering shorter scan times than conventional linear scanning units.  The benefits expected from such a system would include:  1. significant reduction in the detection of compton scattered x-rays (which will degrade image contrast and increase dose)  2. scan rates sufficient to minimize many patient motion problems  3. an increase in the dynamic range available over that of film  4. adequate spatial resolution for many radiologic applications  Since the same coated arrays may be employed in a linear scan format, direct comparison of image quality between the two scanning formats for the same receptor technology will be possible.

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid. Gastric mucosal damage, its healing and mucosal protection will be assessed:  A) macroscopically by scoring and computerized image analysis B) histologically with morphometric quantitation of necrosis C) by determination of mucosal cell proliferation kinetics D) ultrastructurally with scanning and transmission electromicroscopy E) functionally by measurements of ionic fluxes, potential difference and intragastric pH, and F) biochemically by measurements of luminal loss of DNA, protein and blood and the concentration or prostaglandins in the gastric contents.

"MEDIATORS OF INSULIN-DEPENDENT MESSENGER RNA SYNTHESIS Insulin prevents the induction of mRNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dubutyryl cyclic AMP and hydrocortisone in Reuber hepatoma cells but simultaneously acts in an additive fashion with these agents in inducing tyrosine aminotransferase.  These results imply that these agents interact to promote or inhibit mRNA production from specific genes. Therefore, this project will test the idea that insulin, cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids alter production of specific messenger RNAs in Reuber hepatoma cells by altering the charge, abundance or intracellular distribution of genetic regulatory proteins.  Two model proteins that translocate to the nucleus and are probably involved in transcriptional regulation (the glucocorticoid receptor and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase) will be identified in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (2D-PAGE) of radiolabeled extracts of whole cells, nuclei and chromatin. These proteins will be studied to find whether hormonal combinations that alter mRNA induction alter their activation or translocation to the nucleus.  Activation will be sought as changes in the charge (phosphorylation state or other modification) of these receptors using 2D-PAGE.  Translocation will be detected as decreased association of these proteins with the cytosol and increased association with the nucleus after hormonal stimulation, again identifying the receptors with 2D-PAGE.  Cells will be treated with insulin to identify molecules whose charge or abundance is regulated by this hormone, and a molecule will be sought that becomes associated with chromatin after insulin treatment.  Nuclear events such as translocation of regulatory molecules or altered phosphorylation of histones and other proteins will be identified and attempts will be made to correlate these events with altered production of messenger RNAs.  Events that correlate with insulin's ability to abolish the induction of messenger RNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids, will be pursued.  If a putative regulator is found, I will attempt to purify it, study how it is activated, and determine how it associates with chromatin or DNA.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CLINICAL DECISION MAKING This proposal is to develop an integrated program for the representation of complex knowledge and reasoning processes in medicine, using the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) and decision analysis (DA).  The project will address problems in both diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning in two medical domains: coronary disease, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. The planned large-scale AI system will incorporate a common knowledge representation formalism and alternative reasoning programs to do data interpretation, hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing and revision, diagnostic query planning, therapeutic planning and automatically-generated explanations.  DA reasoning will be integrated into the system, especially to improve the test and treatment planning components.  A uniform knowledge base will be developed in the two identified medical domains, utilizing knowledge acquired from the analysis of protocols, expert opinion, case-based learning, hand-coded knowledge from the literature, and strictly limited attempts to automatically acquire structured knowledge from English free-text.  A panel of specific cases will be developed that can be used to validate additions to the knowledge base and changes in the reasoning components of the system.  A series of protocol analyses will be done, involving both diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in clinical settings where uncertainty and risk are predominant factors.  Specific attention will focus on the degree to which experienced clinicians rely on case-based reasoning and means will be developed to represent, index and utilize such case-based experience in the reasoning program.  A new generation of DA tools will be built to aid the construction of DA models for use in actual clinical settings.

"THERAPY-PLANNING STRATEGIES FOR CONSULTATION BY COMPUTER Therapy planning represents an important area for the development of computer-based clinical consultation systems.  Even when a difficult diagnosis has been made, the optimum treatment may be far from clear.  This is particularly true when adjustments to therapy are required after observing a patient's response to initial interventions.  We propose basic research into the representation and use of therapy-planning strategies of the type routinely employed by expert clinicians as they monitor and adjust the treatment for patients with serious disease entities.  In addition, we propose to implement and test these new techniques in the setting of an existing consultation system known as ONCOCIN.  The ONCOCIN program is an oncology protocol management system that encodes the knowledge of highly structured cancer chemotherapy protocols and gives advice on treatment. Although ONCOCIN is currently in routine experimental use by oncologists in the Stanford oncology clinic, the program is limited in its ability to manage patients who have unexpected responses to therapy.  A generalized approach to therapy planning that can be applied to ONCOCIN will broaden the system's scope and increase its clinical utility.  In summary, this proposal combines basic research in the representation of clinical knowledge with a useful application.  The specific aims of the research are:  (1) to conduct basic research into possible representations of the therapy planning process, particularly how plans are modified in response to unusual conditions prior to or during treatment cycles; (2) to develop a computer program to represent the therapy planning processes of expert clinicians; and (3) to interface the planning program with ONCOCIN.

"LONG-TERM PLASMA EXCHANGE IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEM The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very massive reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.  The substantial decrease and improved long term control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol by RPE coupled with hypocholesterolemic drugs should amplify the preliminary evidence which has indicated that regression of early femoral atherosclerosis and nonprogression of advanced coronary lesions can be achieved by drug treatment alone in heterozygous FH.  We propose to undertake long-term (four years) RPE at two week intervals in fifteen heterozygous subjects with FH.  Pretreatment and within treatment coronary atheromatous lesions and ventricular function and perfusion will be assessed by serial quantitative, computerized coronary angiography, rest and exercise Thallium-201 perfusion studies, respectively.  The effectiveness of RPE will be judged not only by longitudinal studies of the plasma exchange group, but also in a randomized concurrent control group of subjects receiving only maximal drug therapy.  In addition, comparison will also be made against two groups of patients (historical controls) selected by Dr. John Brensike from the type II coronary intervention study recently completed at the NIH.  These patients will be selected using the same criteria for entry into this study and will have been treated with diet alone or diet plus cholestyramine.  The subjects will have undergone cardiac catheterization at the start of the study, at two years after entry, and at five years after entry.  In effect, therefore, the results of repeat coronary angiography in fifteen patients who undergo massive reductions in plasma cholesterol by REP plus maximal drug therapy will be compared to three control groups: a randomized concurrently treated group (diet plus maximal drug therapy), and two historical NIH concurrently treated groups (one with dietary treatment only, and a group on diet plus cholestyramine).

"TWO DIMENSIONAL PHOTON COUNTING POSTITION ENCODER A two-dimensional Photon Counting Position Encoder is proposed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) medical cameras.  The new detector uses three new concepts:  1) a method of controlling the spatial distribution of photons from Bismuth Germanate Scintillators, 2) the use of all digital photon counting for processing the photomultiplier signal, and 3) the use of pattern recognition to encode position.  The new detector is expected to reduce the cost of this portion of the PET scanner by approximately a factor of eight.  The cost reduction anticipated for a typical four ring camera will be in the range of $600,000 to $1,000,000 which is 20-40 percent of the cost of the PET scanner.  In addition to the potential cost savings of this new approach, the photon division technique will allow one to obtain 2-3 mm position resolution in two dimensions.

"STUDIES OF THE DISSEMINATION OF CONSULTATION SYSTEMS We propose to undertake resource-related research into the develo]ment of methodologies that will permit dissemination of high performance clinical consultation and data management systems.  We have developed a prototype system which provides a framework for the execution of clinical trials. Our goal is to extend this model to a broader range of investigators, including those in both academic and community settings.  The initial system, named ONCOCIN, was developed on the SUMEX-AIM Resource at Stanford University and is designed to help oncologists manage patients enrolled in experimental cancer chemotherapy protocols.  In its initial three years, the research has focused on theoretical computer science issues regarding the representation of medical knowledge and the development of optimal methods for encouraging the use of computer-based tools by physicians.  The prototype system has been introduced for limited use in our oncology clinic.  Our goal is to allow systems like ONCOCIN to function independently, on their own hardware, so that they can become useful tools for clinical investigators in a variety of research settings.  We propose a five-year effort with the following specific aims:  (1) to transfer the oncology prototype from its current research computer to a powerful professional workstation that provides a model for the technology that will soon allow large scale cost-effective dissemination of clinical consultation systems; (2) to encode and implement for use by ONCOCIN the commonly used chemotherapy protocols from our oncology clinic; (3) to introduce ONCOCIN gradually for ongoing use so that two professional workstations become available in the oncology clinic to assist in the management of patients enrolled in cancer clinical trials; (4) to implement ONCOCIN beyond the Stanford environment to demonstrate the transferability of the technology and its potential for involving community physicians in clinical investigation; and (5) to develop and test methods for assessing the impact of this kind of tool on physicians, and on their modes of practice.

"DIGITAL CONTROL OF REHABILITATION/EXERCISE MACHINES The long term objectives of this work are twofold.  First, to develop adaptive machines which can be used effectively in the evaluation and rehabilitation of muscular deficits due to traluma, disuse or disease in a broad spectrum of the population from victims of accidents and chronic musculoskeletal disorders to atheletes and the aged.  Second, to collaborate with health professionals in collecting and analyzing data, using the unique capabilities of these devices, and to establish a database to make these data readily accessible.  Thus, these machines should be versatile, incorporating active as well as passive exercise capacity, and capable of collecting, archiving, manipulating and comparing quantitative measurements from treatment protocols.  The specific aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an intelligent, digital controller, based upon computer architecture widely used and supported in the industrial process control and biomedical communities.  The controller must be capable of accurate, on-line, feedback regulation of previously developed instrumented machines.  The latter permit motion in three dimensions and employ electrohydraulic control of resistance.  To accomplish this specific aim, several steps are required.  Initially, the dynamic performance of the electrohydraulic actuator unit must be characterized using standard control engineering test protocols.  Next, a prototype test system can be assembled by interfacing a minicomputer with one of the instrumented machines and allowing the computer to emulate digital controller functions.  By varying such parameters as sampling rate, data precision and feedback functions, software/hardware constraints will be established.  Finally, a configuration will be outlined specifying the requisite hardware and software components which will provide acceptable control performance.

"COMPREHENDING SENTENCES WITH LONG-DISTANCE DEPENDENCIES To understand the sentence ""Who did the girl the teacher forced to talk complain to?""  One must determine that ""the girl"" is to be taken as the missing subject of the verb ""talk"" and that ""who"" is the missing object of the preposition ""to.""  Sentences with such long-distance dependencies as that between ""the girl"" and the subject position preceding ""to talk"" pose special problems for theories of sentence comprehension.  They challenge the apparent human limits on short-term memory and processing capacity, in that arbitrary amounts of linguistic material can intervene between the items that are dependent upon each other and any one sentence can contain several long-distance dependencies.  Further, they are subject to unique linguistic constraints that a language user must honor.  We propose experiments to study the comprehension of sentences with long-distance dependencies, using reaction time and other measures of processing difficulty. Our goals are to determine what decision principles people follow in understanding such sentences, to identify the various types of information (lexical, pragmatic, suprasegmental, grammatical constraints) they use in making decisions about long-distance dependencies, and to specify the sequence in which they use functionally different types of information.

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.  The work in the proposed project will build on the extensive previous work in drug monitoring done by these investigators in the Division of Clinical Pharmacology at Stanford and at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy.  ,MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS,3442443,R18HS005263,"['physicians ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' hospital patient care ', ' drug adverse effect ', ' chemotherapy ', ' online computer ', ' computer system design /evaluation ', ' health care facility information system ', ' computer assisted medical decision making ', ' ']",AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R18,1985,227763,-0.08481388832500532
"FETAL LUNG BIOCHEMISTRY AND 3-DIMENSIONAL MICROANATOMY During late fetal development, the lung must prepare for the transition to air breathing.  Maintaining alveolar stability becomes vital for survival. Therapy with glucocorticoids to enhance lung maturity may have immediate and long term consequences for lung structure and function.  This series of investigations is directed toward furthering our basic knowledge of lung secretory cell development.  We will use structural and biochemical methods to test hypotheses of secretory cell function and to test the probabilities that glucocorticoids damage fetal and newborn lung structure.  We intend to study biochemical and 3-dimensional morphologic changes during epithelial cell maturation in the last days of fetal development.  We will test hypotheses of the assembly of lamellar bodies and assess the changes in type II cell maturation induced by glucocorticoids.  This drug induced accelerated maturation is a relevant clinical concern as the effects are widespread within the lung and have not been shown to be entirely reversible during postnatal growth.

"DESIGN OF IMPROVED ACOUSTIC IMAGING TRANSDUCERS The purpose of this work is to greatly improve the performance of ultrasonic imaging transducers.  Improvements are anticipated in range, and clarity of images, especially of chest cavity images, which require the greatest range of clarity.  In addition, greater flexibility and lower noise levels will be achieved through signal conditioning at the transducer site.  these improvements will be made by concerted work in four areas: 1.  Evaluation of new transducer materials and composites.  Literature of piezoelectic materials and devices will be constantly reviewed, and, when results appear to have use in medical imaging transducers, laboratory tests of the materials will be conducted.  2.  Impedance and energy matching of transducers to aqueous media.  Techniques to be investigated include geometric matching, multiple thin layer matching, and cooperative electical matching.  3.  Novel transducer geometries and excitation methods.  Novel transducer geometries include well matched linear and arc sector arrays, radial surface wave devices, and surface wave scanning arrays.  4.  Thin film, thick film, and hybrid circuit technologies.  Included in this category are the fabrication of microelectronic preamplifier circuits on the transducer and the formation of intricate conductor patterns on the transducer elements.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred. While a substantial body of evidence indicates that altered DNA plays a major role in this process, the role of non-DNA factors has also been demonstrated.  In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time. Silver and in vitro radiolabeling techniques have been developed to permit visualization of nanogram amounts of protein(s) with applicability to computer technology.  Using these techniques, we have identified induction of tumor-associated proteins (TAP) in the total NHCP fraction as well as in the phenol-soluble fraction (phosphoproteins) of rat hepatic chromatins during AAF and DEN carcinogenesis and resulting hepatocellular carcinomas. Additionally, cytosolic AAF and DEN-TAPs have been similarly demonstrated. We will determine to what extent these changes in NHCP and cytosolic proteins characterize the general process of carcinogenesis by examining spontaneous and chemically-induced hepatic and thymus tumors in a variety of mouse inbred strains.  We will further determine the time of appearance, sub-fraction location, and in the case of NHCP, genomic distribution of TAP during chemical carcinogenesis; isolate these proteins, and produce monoclonal antibodies for use in their study, as well as determining their functional significance.  Lastly, we will continue our technological developments to assure maximum detection, and computer-assisted image-processing of the complex protein patterns that characterize normal and malignant cells in order to confirm and further detect potential hallmark proteins, whose occurrence mark malignant induction.

"SIMULATION OF MENTAL PROCESSES IN LIGHT OF THE BRAIN This project is aimed at the development of explicit computational models of perceptual and cognitive processes, relying on mechanism which are consistent with what is known about the physiology and anatomy of the brain.  Recent work simulating perceptual and cognitive processes indicates that this is a fertile path to follow, but to do this adequately I need to learn more about the brain and more about the simulation of the kinds of computational processes which seem consistent with what goes on in the brain.  The first two years of this award would be devoted primarily to obtaining this background, as well as to research applying what I would be learning to a process at the interface between perception and cognition--namely reading.  Before the start of the career development award I plan to obtain some basic background in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and computer simulation techniques used in artificial intelligence.  I plan to spend the first year of the award at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Massachusetts Institue of Technology, studying recent advances in the understanding of parallel computation, and working on the development of a neurally plausible simulation model of the visual aspects of reading.  I plan to spend the second year at the Aphasia Research Center of Boston University at the Boston Veterans Administration Hospital, rounding out my background in the neurological basis of cognition and beginning research designed to use the effects of brain damage as a way of finding out about the nature of the underlying processing system. Specifically, I would study the disturbance of word processing ability that arises in deep dyslexia a type of reading disability resulting from damage in certain ageas of the brain.  During the summer of the second year I also plan to participated in an advanced neurophysiology course such as the one offered at Cold Springs Harbor, Long Island.

"IMAGE ANALYSIS OF STAINED AND UNSTAINED MACROMOLECULES The structures of polyoma virus and its polymorphic aggregates, SV40 virus, myosin subfragment-1, and the chloroplast cytochrome b6/f complex will be studied by electron microscopy and image analysis methods.  These studies are aimed at answering questions about the overall structure, assembly, stability, and function of these macromolecular aggregates.  We will learn about protein-protein interactions in polyoma, SV40, myosin subfragment-1, and cytochrome b6/f, protein-nucleic acid associations in polyoma and SV40, and protein-lipid associations in cytochrome b6/f.  The biological significance of each of these systems is well documented. Polyoma and SV40 do not cause malignancies in their natural hosts (mice and rhesus monkeys), but their oncogenic potential is revealed when high concentrations of virus are injected into either foreign hosts or natural hosts lacking a functional immunological system.  Subfragment-1, the head portion of myosin, is responsible for force generation in muscle through the hydrolysis of ATP and interaction with actin.

We have developed a prototype of an intermediate type of system in which the user can rapidly indicate the approximate location of significant objects after which the system applies an edge following algorithm to determine the exact boundary of the object. This system will be much faster to use than ""dumb"" morphometry systems and much less costly than ""intelligent"" image analyzers costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.  This system uses a new VLSI microprocessor specialized for signal processing tasks and innovative image processing circuitry we have designed.

"ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS IN OCULAR INFLAMMATORY DISEASES Our goal is the prevention of blindness and morbidity associated with inflammatory eye diseases, particularly trachoma and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.  The studies proposed on trachoma will examine in detail the variations in host response to a single well characterized organism (Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the eye).  It will allow us to evaluate response of the external eye to infection and the variations in disease that are intrinsic or induced (e.g. atopy or depressed cellular immunity.  the grading of host repsonse (trachoma intensity) and microbial load (number of chlamydial elementary bodies) provide a quantitative system to study this interaction of host and environmental factors.  In the studies of chlamydial infections we will (1) initiate studies on the role of individual host response to chlamydial infection; (2) elucidate the role of Chlamydia trachomatis as a cause of other illness in trachoma endemic areas; (3) evaluate new technology for the diagnosis of ocular chlamydial infections; (4) develop and validate simplified diagnostic techniques for endemic trachoma; (5) continue limited treatment trials for the prevention of blindness from trachoms.  The major theme of these studies on trachoma will be an evaluation of the host response to infection of the conjunctiva.  An important intermediate goal will be the identification of those host factors that are associated with the blingind consequences of trachoma.  Herpes simplex virus and other infections of the eye continue to be a major problem, both in the United States and in other countries.  Although treatment of ocular herpes has improved considerably in recent years, the disease continues to cause loss of vision and morbidity in many patients. In order to improve treatment of this disease by ophthalmologists, further refinements will be made in a computer model to provide treatment recommendations for herpetic eye disease.

"PHOTOINDUCED THROMBOTIC STROKE--MECHANISMS AND THERAPY The major goal of this project is to document patterns of platelet deposition, blood flow and edema during the development of focal thrombotic stroke, and the effects of prophylactic agents on mitigating or inhibiting thrombus formation in brain vasculature.  A secondary goal is to determine whether lipid peroxidation is associated with thrombotic stroke, and to characterize the distribution of lipid peroxides in parenchyma and endothelium of the affected tissue zone and correlate this with morphological indices as the stroke progresses.  The proposed studies will utilize our recently characterized model of reproducible focal cerebral infarction precipitated by photochemically induced thrombosis of cortical vasculature, in rats injected systemically with the potent photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal.  The progression of thrombosis will be represented by platelets radiolabeled with IIIindium, and local cerebral blood flow will be evaluated by 14C-labeled iodoantipyrine imaging.  Microvascular occlusion will be visualized directly by carbon-black perfusion.  The effect on these parameters of agents known to mitigate thrombosis of single vessels in vivo will be evaluated in the present context of a network of occluded vasculature; such agents include calcium channel antagonists (nimodipine, nifedipine, verapamil), antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, indomethacin, prostacyclin), free radical scavengers (ethanol, dimethylsufoxide, glycerol) and the clot-specific fibrinolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA).  Enhancement of the effect of t-PA by prior administration of lys-plasminogen will be tested also.  The hypothesis that lipid peroxidation inhibits the recovery of tissue compromised by ischemia can be studied if lipid peroxide formation can be induced in specific tissue zones.  In this model it is likely that platelet adhesion and subsequent aggregation are stimulated by photochemical peroxidation of endothelial lipids.  Owing to the reproducible progression of blood flow deficit in the photoinduced lesion, the present model may facilitate stable conditions for lipid peroxidation, observable as conjugated dienes, in the parenchyma as well.  The relative content (predicted to be low) of endothelial lipid peroxides, and the efficiency of photochemical induction of endothelial defects will be determined by similar experiments conducted with endothelial cells in culture.  The proposed work enables rigorous study of the thrombotic process and its mitigation under well-controlled condition in brain microvessels, with consequent benefit to potential stroke patients.

"KINEMATIC AND CELLULAR STUDIES OF MOTOR CONTROL The main goal is to understand how the central nervous system coordinates the large number of degrees of freedom of the arm.  The experimental approach includes recording and analysis of the kinematics of multijoint movements.  In some cases, a simple mechanical system is used to record the movements.  When full arm freedom is required, an optoelectric recording system is used.  Work will continue on the following projects on multijoint control.  1. Multijoint movements of the right and left arms are being compared.  The comparison includes movements to visual targets, movements which are unexpectedly perturbed, and isometric force production.  2. Studies of the multijoint movements of patients with movement disorders will be continued.  To date, there has been concentration on patients with cerebellar disease and Parkinson's disease.  Simple movements to visual targets have been emphasized.  In the next year, unexpectedly perturbed movements and isometric force production will be studied in these same patient groups, in order to more fully characterize the physiology of these disorders.  3. We are studying the control of multijoint movements in the presence of unexpected mechanical loads.  We recently found that with same load types subjects make movements with the same kinematic characteristics as in the unloaded condition.  This suggests that there may be a mechanism for rapid real-time trajectory corrections, so that we will investigate this motor-compensation mechanism more fully.  4. The multijoint arm stiffness of patients with a variety of central lesions will be compared to that of normal individuals.  By searching for changes in the stiffness due to central diseases, we hope to learn what central structures are involved in stiffness control.

"NEUTROPHIL AND ENDOTHELIAL/EPITHELIAL CELL INTERACTIONS Inflammatory reactions in the airways involve emigration of neutrophils across the blood vessel endothelium and then across the pulmonary epithelium.  It is hypothesized that this inflammatory cell accumulation can lead to altered airway reactivity.  Stimulated neutrophils can produce epithelial injury and/or increased permeability which may provide better access for antigens, mediators, and/or irritants to neuronal and/or humoral trigger mechanisms in the airway.  In this project we will examine the mechanisms involved in four aspects of neutrophils emigration and epithelial injury:  (1) adherence of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium, (2) transendothelial migration, (3) transepithelial migration, and (4) epithelial injury by neutrophils activated on the apical side of the epithelium.  We will used cell culture techniques to study endothelial cells from large vessels and from the microvasculature and epithelial cells from alveoli and large airways.  For many of the studies we will use human neutrophils and human endothelial and epithelial cells.  Adherence will be assayed with radiolabeled neutrophils and with video microscopy with computer assisted image analysis.  Migration will be studied in standard chemotactic chambers and in specially designed horizontal and vertical chambers for measurement of bioelectric properties of the monolayers and their permeability.  Questions to be addressed include the following:   Are there specific sites or macromolecules on endothelial cells or epithelial cells to which neutrophils attach?  Do endothelial cells or epithelial cells produce factors which increase or decrease adherence?  Do neutrophils alter the barrier properties of endothelial and epithelial monolayers during migration?  Our central hypothesis is that endothelial cells and epithelial cells play an active role in neutrophil emigration,and once we know the mechanism for this facilitated movement, new pharmacologic strategies for control of inflammation may be possible.  The mechanism of neutrophil adherence and migration should also be applicable to other inflammatory lung diseases such as pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome.

"MASS SPECTROMETRY IN ORGANIC AND BIOCHEMISTRY The application of various mass spectrometric techniques to structure elucidation of three classes of biologically important natural products will be studied.  The first group encompasses novel marine sterols, which differ primarily from terrestrial sterols in the nature of their unusual (elongated or branched) side chains.  This feature appears to be of importance in cell membrane function and a detailed knowledge of the mass spectral fragmentation pattern of such sterol types is needed for structural elucidation of novel and as yet unidentified sterols of marine organisms.  Much of this work requires synthesis of requisite sterol reference compounds or synthetic verification of postulated structure.  The second group of natural products deals with the unusual phospholipids isolated from marine organisms.  Much less is known about the mass spectrometric behavior of this biologically important class of natural products as compared to sterols, and we intend to explore this field in detail by comparing different ionization techniques (electron impact vs. field desorption vs. chemical ionization vs. fast atom bombardment) since each is likely to provide special structural information on specific portions of the phospholipid molecule.  Since the novel marine phospholipids are particularly unusual in the context of their unprecedented fatty acid components (usually polyunsaturated), work is also envisaged on the mass spectrometric location of such double bonds in long-chain fatty acids.  Finally, we intend to develop mass spectral procedures (notably through the use of chemical ionization mass spectrometry with hydrogen gas) in the porphyrin field with the aim of accomplishing an as yet largely unrealized goal, namely the location of chemical substituents in the four different pyrrole rings of the prophyrin molecule solely through the use of mass spectrometry.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred. While a substantial body of evidence indicates that altered DNA plays a major role in this process, the role of non-DNA factors has also been demonstrated.  In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time.

"PRIMATE CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall, long range objectives are to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the marmoset family (Callitrichidae), in social and sexual communication.  The scent marks of these primates encode messages on identify of species, subspecies, and individual as well as information relating to sexual and social status.  Scent mark material, a mixture of gland secretion, some urine and possibly genital discharge, is chemically complex and includes esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and hydrocarbons.  To date our analytical studies using high resolution capillary gas chromatography have not revealed any qualitative differences in the scent marks of animals which differ in their sex, subspecies or species.  Therefore, we have embarked on a study to evaluate quantitative differences in the scent mark constituents.  Studies are proposed to identify the concentration profiles of the components which define gender, subspecies and species.  Analysis by computerized pattern recognition techniques will target those components which are correlated with gender, subspecies and species.  Sophisticated GC/MS/DS instrumentation will then be employed as the major tool for identification and quantitation of the targeted components.  Their role in chemical communication will be tested by behavioral assay.  Bacterial studies will also be undertaken to establish the role of microbial action in the production of some of the highly volatile components.  Finally, studies aimed at the identification of previously unknown components of lower volatility will be carried out.  We anticipate that this research will eventually lead to a deciphering of the chemical code such that in the end it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations the wide variety of communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and a bacteriologist has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.

The ONCOCIN program is an oncology protocol management system that encodes the knowledge of highly structured cancer chemotherapy protocols and gives advice on treatment. Although ONCOCIN is currently in routine experimental use by oncologists in the Stanford oncology clinic, the program is limited in its ability to manage patients who have unexpected responses to therapy.  A generalized approach to therapy planning that can be applied to ONCOCIN will broaden the system's scope and increase its clinical utility.  In summary, this proposal combines basic research in the representation of clinical knowledge with a useful application.  The specific aims of the research are:  (1) to conduct basic research into possible representations of the therapy planning process, particularly how plans are modified in response to unusual conditions prior to or during treatment cycles; (2) to develop a computer program to represent the therapy planning processes of expert clinicians; and (3) to interface the planning program with ONCOCIN.

"EVALUATION OF CORONARY DISEASE BY DIGITAL ANGIOGRAPHY The aim of this porposal is to assess the feasibility of using digital angiography to evaluate the severity of coronary artery disease. Quantitative methods to be studied will include those designed to measure anatomic coronary artery narrowing, myocardial perfusion abnormalities and segmental myocardial wall dysfunction induced by myocardial ischemia. Results will be compared to the computer-assisted method of measuring lesion dimensions from standard contrast angiograms previously developed by Brown, et al.  One quantitative method to be evaluated will involve the use of videodensitometric as well as image border methods for measuring anatomic coronary artery narrowing from digital subtraction angiograms obtained following intracoronary injection of contrast material.  Both methods will be used to measure the minimum lumen diameter (and area) of coronary artery lesions.  We also will attempt to develop less invasive methods for obtaining coronary angiograms and quantitating the severity of coronary stenosis following injection of contrast material into the aortic root.  Image processing algorithms to be evaluated in these low contrast images will include band pass filtering of electrocardiogram-gated images and a two-dimensional background interpolation method.  The accuracy of these methods will be tested in phantom, dog and clinical models.  A second general quantitative method for assessing the severity of coronary artery disease will entail evaluating myocardial perfusion using videodensitometry to generate contrast density versus time curves in myocardial regions supplied by individual coronary arteries.  Data obtained from segments of myocardium supplied by stenotic coronary arteries will be compared to data from segments supplied by non-stenotic arteries.  Studies will be performed in dogs and humans.  The third general method for evaluating coronary artery disease involves the use of digital subtraction angiography to obtain left ventricular angiograms as a means of assessing global and segmental systolic and diastolic ventricular function at rest and immediately following atrial pacing in humans.  The myocardial perfusion and segmental wall motion methods both will be related to the minimum lumen diameter of lesions in coronary arteries supplying each myocardial segment.  If successful, these studies will provide improved methods for assessing the presence and severity of coronary lesions during routine clinical evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

"RECONSTRUCTION AND DISPLAY IN TOMOGRAPHIC RADIOLOGY This is a renewal application for a grant currently entitled ""Computer Technology for Transaxial Tomography"".  The change in title to ""Reconstruction and Display in Tomographic Radiology"" reflects a shift in the nature of the proposed work.  We propose to cover various modalities in radiology--namely, computerized tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US)--all of which are tomographic in the sense that they produce images of slices through the human body.  ""Reconstruction"" in the title of the proposal is to be interpreted as the procedure to produce such images from the measured raw data in CT, PET, and MRI.  ""Display"" in the title is to be interpreted as the procedure to put together in three-dimensional (3D)--or (including time) 4D--space the information that exists in the individual slices.  In ""reconstruction"" we plan to concentrate on finite series expansion methods, methods derived from a semi-continuous formulation, preprocessing of incomplete or distorted data, with applications to CT, PET, and MRI.  In ""display"" we plan to concentrate on segmentation (identification of structures of interest, such as specific organs and tumors, in the 3D space) and on rapid display, analysis, and manipulation of the identified structures, with applications to measurement of volumetric changes in soft-tissue masses, surgical planning, radiation therapy treatment planning, and characterization of the normal, ischemic and scarred myocardium.  In all cases computer software will be fully developed, implemented, tested, and evaluated, on the kind of computing equipment that is commonly available in radiology departments.

"COMPREHENDING SENTENCES WITH LONG-DISTANCE DEPENDENCIES To understand the sentence ""Who did the girl the teacher forced to talk complain to?""  One must determine that ""the girl"" is to be taken as the missing subject of the verb ""talk"" and that ""who"" is the missing object of the preposition ""to.""  Sentences with such long-distance dependencies as that between ""the girl"" and the subject position preceding ""to talk"" pose special problems for theories of sentence comprehension.  They challenge the apparent human limits on short-term memory and processing capacity, in that arbitrary amounts of linguistic material can intervene between the items that are dependent upon each other and any one sentence can contain several long-distance dependencies.  Further, they are subject to unique linguistic constraints that a language user must honor.  We propose experiments to study the comprehension of sentences with long-distance dependencies, using reaction time and other measures of processing difficulty. Our goals are to determine what decision principles people follow in understanding such sentences, to identify the various types of information (lexical, pragmatic, suprasegmental, grammatical constraints) they use in making decisions about long-distance dependencies, and to specify the sequence in which they use functionally different types of information.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPH NODE DISEASES We seek support to (1) investigate fundamental issues in applications of artificial intelligence to medicine within the context of lymph node pathology and (2) construct a useful diagnostic system for the hematopathology field.  The complexity of hematopathology poses a rich set of challenges for artificial intelligence in medicine.  Our research addresses fundamental problems of knowledge representation, reasoning strategies, user modeling, explanation, and user acceptance.  Our goal is to build a useful decision system for pathologists.  Such a working system would be extraordinarily useful for the lymph node pathology field.  Many studies have documented that there are major problems in the diagnosis and classification of malignant lymphomas and they are often confused with benign diseases.  This poses a major problem for the oncologist as accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment.  We have built a prototype experty system called PATHFINDER which makes diagnoses of lymph node pathology through a consideration of 50 malignant and 30 benign diseases and approximately 500 histopathologic findings.  The program uses the method of sequential diagnosis; it can generate differential diagnoses based on a small number of findings and can suggest other findings useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis.  Consensus meetings have already resulted in agreement on features and diseases to be used by the program. Our research plans are to further develop PATHFINDER so that it can become not only a regularly used diagnostic tool for users having different levels of training and experience, but also can serve as a powerful teaching system.  The proposed expert system will provide a unique integrated knowledge base for the benign diseases of lymph nodes.  AIDS, and lymphomas giving the practicing pathologist immediate access to accurate morphologic classification and diagnostic criteria, while at the same time providing guidance as to whether additional tests (immunologic, cytogenetic, cell-kinetic, and immunogenetic) are likely to be informative.  It is anticipated that a working diagnostic system could improve the reproducibility and reliability of lymphoma diagnosis, facilitate the standardization of diagnoses in clinical trials, and help ensure appropriate therapy at the community hospital level.  We plan to substantially increase the quantity and quality of knowledge through (1) the integration of independent knowledge bases from the four experts mentioned above, (2) the integration of laboratory, clinical, immunologic, cell kinetic, cytogenetic, and immunogenetic information, and (3) the restructuring of the knowledge base to include dependencies among features.  Furthermore, we will (4) facilitate the identification of morphologic features and standardize definitions of features and diseases by incorporating detailed textual and pictorial descriptions (using videodisk technology), (5) develop mapping schemes that will facilitate the understanding of the many classification systems for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and (6) implement methods for the detection of multiple discordant histologies, progression of disease over time, and atypical proliferation.  Also, we will implement and incorporate into the program (1) scoring methods when features are interdependent, (2) heuristics for high-level control of reasoning strategies, (3) heuristics which customize the bahavior of the program to the expertise of the user, (4) formal decision analysis techniques, and (5) methods for system explanation. Throughout the three year period, we will also monitor our progress through iterative testing of reasoning strategies and frequent validations of the program's knowledge.

"LONG-TERM PLASMA EXCHANGE IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEM The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very massive reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.  The substantial decrease and improved long term control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol by RPE coupled with hypocholesterolemic drugs should amplify the preliminary evidence which has indicated that regression of early femoral atherosclerosis and nonprogression of advanced coronary lesions can be achieved by drug treatment alone in heterozygous FH.  We propose to undertake long-term (four years) RPE at two week intervals in fifteen heterozygous subjects with FH.  Pretreatment and within treatment coronary atheromatous lesions and ventricular function and perfusion will be assessed by serial quantitative, computerized coronary angiography, rest and exercise Thallium-201 perfusion studies, respectively.  The effectiveness of RPE will be judged not only by longitudinal studies of the plasma exchange group, but also in a randomized concurrent control group of subjects receiving only maximal drug therapy.  In addition, comparison will also be made against two groups of patients (historical controls) selected by Dr. John Brensike from the type II coronary intervention study recently completed at the NIH.  These patients will be selected using the same criteria for entry into this study and will have been treated with diet alone or diet plus cholestyramine.  The subjects will have undergone cardiac catheterization at the start of the study, at two years after entry, and at five years after entry.  In effect, therefore, the results of repeat coronary angiography in fifteen patients who undergo massive reductions in plasma cholesterol by REP plus maximal drug therapy will be compared to three control groups: a randomized concurrently treated group (diet plus maximal drug therapy), and two historical NIH concurrently treated groups (one with dietary treatment only, and a group on diet plus cholestyramine).

Second, we seek a detailed model for the motions of ligands in proteins. Conventional molecular dynamics and trajectory calculations will be compared to methods that reveal packing defects and channels in proteins in a direct way.

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.

"NOVEL PROBES FOR EFFICIENT GENETIC DISEASE DIAGNOSIS Current techniques for the diagnosis of genetic disease are limited by an inability to detect the majority of mutations and polymorphisms in DNA. DNA molecules which differ by one or a few base pairs can most efficiently be distinguished currently by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis due to sequence specific differences in melting properties of the DNA. However, base changes can be detected only in domains of the molecule which melt first in these gels.  We propose to improve this technique so that base pair changes can be detected in all domains of a DNA molecule.  We will modify DNA probes in ways that will significantly alter the melting behavior of DNA hybrids, so that new regions of the DNA molecule will be included in the first melting domain.  In addition, we will use experimental data to generate computer models to predict melting behavior of modified DNA molecules.  These computer programs can then be used to design optimal probes for detecting sequence changes in any DNA molecule. This technology should be broad enough for application to any gene of interest, and could lead to the commercial development of diagnostic tests for a number of genetic diseases.

"PERCEIVING STRUCTURE IN EVENTS The aim of this project is to identify the means by which human observers organize moving structures and perceive them as dynamic wholes.  The particular moving structures used will be computer-generated displays of dots that, in their movement, mimic human walkers, rolling wheels, and other everyday events.  Previous research has shown that these displays yield robust percepts, despite their relative impoverishment of seen elements.  And the dearth of elements involved allows simple and concise mathematical description.  This project will proceed on three fronts.  The first will study perceptual organization with a particular focus on how much time is needed to organize a dynamic stimulus.  Brief displays of systems of dots will be displayed for varying amounts of time in order to assess the durations necessary for the identification of familiar movements of near-familiar objects.  The second will study perceptual organization with a focus on the effectiveness of various kinds of camouflage in inhibiting identification of common objects in motion.  Static and dynamic camouflages of several types will be employed, with a particular emphasis on the movement parameters of a dynamic camouflage that are most effective in interfering with identification.  The third will study perception organization with a focus on the information available about movement in iconic memory.  Previous research has shown that such information is available, and the nature of the coded form of that information will be assessed.  The idea is that if information about many parameters of movement is available as early as the icon, then the perceiver is clearly attuned to that information and appears not to need to elaborate it in a computational fashion.  The disciplines involved in this study are, primarily, psychology and visual perception, and, secondarily, artificial intelligence and computer simulation.  The health relatedness of this project is to be measured in terms of understanding the normal function of the human visual/perceptual system, both in situations of natural complexity and in reduced complexity such as when viewing elements on radar screens, and when watching for pedestrians crossing the streets at night.

"AUTOMATION OF DNA SEQUENCE DATA ENTRY DNA sequence determination has become a standard method for the characterization of newly isolated genes.  Recent advances in the technology for the determination of DNA sequences have allowed large amounts of data to accumulate rapidly.  However, methods for transferring that data into the computer, where it is to be analysed, are still far from ideal, in that they require considerable manual interention.  We propose to develop a highly automated system that will greatly increase the accuracy and the speed with which sequence data can be collected and analysed.  The method requires first producing a digital image of the sequencing radioautogram.  Algorithms will then be devised that are able to convert that ditigized data into a DNA sequence.  A key feature of the software for this interpretative step is that it will operate according to a set of heuristic procedures that are clearly defined and which can easily be modified and extended.  When these rules fail to provide an unambiguous interpretion then operator assistance will be requested to make a final decision.  An important consequence of the strategy is that the primary data upon which the DNA sequence depends will be available in machine-readable form.  Appropriate software will be developed to manage this primary data and to assist in the resolution of discrepancies that may arise during the course of a sequencing project.

"VISUOMOTOR COORDINATION:  NEURAL NETWORKS AND SCHEMAS Our approach to analyzing mechanisms of visuomotor coordination is two-fold:  ""top-down"", to offer a coordinated control program of interacting schemas (concurrently active programs suitably structured for action-perception systems) to model behavior noted by neuroethologists; and ""bottom-up"", to provide detailed models of neural networks which are consistent with known anatomy and physiology, but which involve additional assumptions, amenable to experimental test, to yield a network capable of exhibiting appropriate behavior.  Where possible, we implement a family of models, rather than a single model, to facilitate computer experiments and animal experiments which may discriminate between alternative mechanisms. Specifically, we plan to conduct studies of the following subtopics:  (1) Modelling tectum-pretectum interactions subserving pattern-recognition in anurans; (2) Detailed neural modelling of retina; (3) Modelling patterns of behavior in frog and toad while developing a theory of motor schemas and their coordination for orientation, sidestepping, snapping, etc.; and (4) Developing mathematical and computer methodology for exploring a model-family to determine which subset of models approximates satisfaction of a given set of constraints.

"IMPROVEMENT OF DIGITAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF CORONARY ARTERIES Coronary arteriosclerosis is a leading cause of death in U.S., and it is to a large degree the presence or absence of severe coronary stenoses which determines the risk of death.  Because many patients who suffer from this disease are asymptomatic until their first attack, a safe, inexpensive diagnostic procedure for detecting coronary artery stenoses would be beneficial.  The diagnosis as currently carried out requires that a large catheter be inserted into the orifice of each artery in order to inject opaque dye to make the arteries visible with X rays.  The increased contrast sensitivity of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) permits a less invasive technique involving an injection into the aortic root, a smaller catheter, and reduced dye volumes, but it has been of only limited success largely because of image degradation caused by patient motion during image acquisition.  The aim of this project is to develop and test image processing algorithms for the improvement of digital angiography of coronary arteries.  The algorithms search for a geometrical transformation to produce an optimal registration of two images before subtraction.  They are based on a new application of the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics, a new class of transformation functions, a new method of machine calibration, and new application of search methods developed in the field of artifical intelligence for function optimization.  As a result these algorithms represent the first approach to image registration which is capable of handling true three dimensional warping.  The development and evaluation of the algorithms will be carried out on both a specially designed phantom and on data derived in a new way from patient studies. The patient studies will be acquired during angioplasty procedures in which an inflated balloon and catheter will serve as phantom arteries of known dimensions.  The availability of known phantoms located in the chest on a beating human heart will provide for the first time an opportunity for quantitative evaluation of the success of the image enhancement algorithms in a realistic environment.  Thus, the proposed research will employ new techniques of image registration with a new technique for image evaluation to the problem of reducing motion effects in digital subtraction angiography.

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid. Gastric mucosal damage, its healing and mucosal protection will be assessed:  A) macroscopically by scoring and computerized image analysis B) histologically with morphometric quantitation of necrosis C) by determination of mucosal cell proliferation kinetics D) ultrastructurally with scanning and transmission electromicroscopy E) functionally by measurements of ionic fluxes, potential difference and intragastric pH, and F) biochemically by measurements of luminal loss of DNA, protein and blood and the concentration or prostaglandins in the gastric contents.  TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISM(S) OF EFA PROMOTED GASTRIC MUCOSAL PROTECTION WE PLAN TO STUDY:  (1) THE EFFECT OF DNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS INHIBITORS AND OF MICROTUBULES AND MICROFILAMENTS DISRUPTIVE AGENTS ON EFA PROTECTION; (2) RESISTANCE OF RESTORED SURFACE EPITHELIUM TO SUBSEQUENT INJURY; (3) ACTION OF EFA ON ISOLATED GASTRIC MUCOSAL CELLS (SURFACE, PROLIFERATIVE ZONE) THEIR VIABILITY AND ABILITY TO GENERATE PROSTAGLANDINS.

"NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE ANALYSIS We have developed a method to clone synthetic DNAs with regions of random sequence.  We are using this technique to create millions of ribosome binding sites in an isogenic background.  The cloning vehicle contains the lacZ gene positioned to allow quantitation of initiation from each binding site and the f1 origin which allows rapid DNA sequencing.  From a large set of sequences for which we know the relative efficiencies of initiation we can build linear models of the E. coli ribosome binding site.  We will construct plasmids with regions that differ on the 5' and 3' sides from our original plasmid in order to study the more complex effects of mRNA structure and context on translational initiation.  We propose to extend this technique into a tool for the study of any binding site.  We are also studying sequence specific recognition of DNA by proteins.  We have adapted the Shannon measure of information to quantitate the information content of several recognition systems.  This has led to a prediction that the T7 late promoters have overlapping repressor sites, a prediction that we are now testing.  We have shown that the information content of sites for recognizer proteins is related to the sequence specific binding energies, and have devised a method to determine the quantitative sequence preferences of proteins through in vitro binding to random DNA.

"CUTANEOUS PATERN PERCEPTION The proposed research will investigate the perception of tactile patterns by human subjects.  The tactile patterns will be generated on arrays of stimulators that fit against the subject's fingertips.  Each array consists of 144 stimulators arranged in a matrix 6 columns by 24 rows.  Sets of patterns differing along such dimensions as location, intensity, number of line segments, and so forth will be generated and presented to subjects. Response measures will include identification, discrimination, reaction time, and pattern matching.  Three aspects of tactile pattern perception will be examined:  masking, interactions among multiple sites of stimulation, and the role of experience.  A temporal masking paradigm will be used to see how the perception of tactile patterns is interfered with by tactile maskers and how the nature of the interference changes with changes in the type of masker and in the temporal separation between target and masker.  In the studies of interaction among multiple sites, patterns will be presented to as many as three sites on the fingertips and palm.  This paradigm will be used to assess the role of attention in tactile information processing. The role of short-term experience will be examined by measuring changes in pattern perception as subjects learn to identify and discriminate tactile patterns.  The effect of long-term experience will be evaluated by comparing the performance of groups of subjects who differ in the amount and nature of their experience with complex tactile patterns.  One group will be Optacon users, blind individuals who can read by means of a tactile array.  The other groups will be blind individuals without Optacon experience and several groups of sighted subjects with varying amounts of tactile experience.  The proposed research will be concerned with drawing parallels between tactile processing and visual and auditory processing, with developing measures relevant to understanding the neural coding of tactile patterns, and with improving cutaneous communication systems for the blind, deaf, and deaf-blind.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CLINICAL DECISION MAKING This proposal is to develop an integrated program for the representation of complex knowledge and reasoning processes in medicine, using the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) and decision analysis (DA).  The project will address problems in both diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning in two medical domains: coronary disease, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. The planned large-scale AI system will incorporate a common knowledge representation formalism and alternative reasoning programs to do data interpretation, hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing and revision, diagnostic query planning, therapeutic planning and automatically-generated explanations.  DA reasoning will be integrated into the system, especially to improve the test and treatment planning components.  A uniform knowledge base will be developed in the two identified medical domains, utilizing knowledge acquired from the analysis of protocols, expert opinion, case-based learning, hand-coded knowledge from the literature, and strictly limited attempts to automatically acquire structured knowledge from English free-text.  A panel of specific cases will be developed that can be used to validate additions to the knowledge base and changes in the reasoning components of the system.  A series of protocol analyses will be done, involving both diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in clinical settings where uncertainty and risk are predominant factors.  Specific attention will focus on the degree to which experienced clinicians rely on case-based reasoning and means will be developed to represent, index and utilize such case-based experience in the reasoning program.  A new generation of DA tools will be built to aid the construction of DA models for use in actual clinical settings.  These tools will utilize the same knowledge bases as the AI models, and will share with them the ability to look in varying depth of detail at problems and to generate explanations of their workings.  A set of template analyses dealing with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, renal transplantation, use of anticoagulant therapy and the timing of surgery for valvular heart disease, and a knowledge base of risk and prognosis estimates in these domains will also be constructed.

"CONTEXT-BASED AUTOMATED DETECTION OF ABNORMAL EEG WAVES The proposed research will investigate the development of an ""intelligent"", multichannel (16 channels) automated (general purpose computer-based) system for the reliable detection of epileptogenic sharp waveforms (spikes and shart waves-STs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG).  The system will provide the time of occurrence of individual STs, their spatial location, along with values of pertinent electrographic characteristics (e.g. amplitude, duration) thereof.  Special attention will be given to the minimization of false alarms due to artifact and normal EEG activity.  Such a system will especially facilitate the rapid and reliable analysis of long-term EEG recordings from subjects with known or suspected epilepsy, thus contributing to their optimum therapeutic management as well as resulting in savings of time and money.  Extensive heuristics based on human pattern recognition, which involves contextbased analysis, will be utilized.  In this way, the system will incorporate the intelligence of an electroencephalographer (EEGer).  An Artificial Intelligence approach will be implemented, whereby EEG features quantifying candidate waveforms, as well as automated assessment of the subject's state of consciousness will be presented to an Expert System for eventual decision making.  The knowledge base of the Expert system will be developed in close cooperation with an experienced EEGer, so that the extensive contextbased heuristics utilized in the visual analysis process (e.g. spatio-temporal processing involving multichannel correlations) will be implemented.  Special emphasis will be given to programming into the detection system the ability to discriminate against ST-like artifactual activity in the EEG record (e.g. electrocardiographic and electromyographic interference) as well as against sharp but normal EEG activity (e.g. sleep spindles).  Extensive validation studies will be conducted utilizing EEG data from epileptic subjects, other patients, and normal controls.

"ALGORITHMS FOR ARRHYTHMIA IDENTIFICATION Our general goal is automatic identification of arrhythmias within implantable devices by computer-based signal processing of the intracardiac electrograms.  This goal appears to be realizable because:  1) the arrhythmias to be identified can be provoked in the catheter electrophysiology laboratory and the resulting electrograms can be recorded for detailed analysis; 2) modern signal processing techniques exist for characterizing the electrograms in the time domain and by spectral content; 3) computer algorithms can be designed to recognize these characteristic electrogram features in each arrhythmia; 4) implantable microcomputers are available in which the algorithms can be implemented.  An important premise of this proposal is that the hardware for electrical termination of arrhythmia is already availbale and thus there is a risk of new generations of devices being implanted for arrhythmia control before the underlying electrophysiologic concepts and pattern recognition rules for identifying the arrhythmia are developed and tested.  The signal processing algorithms and decision rules for automatic detection and discrimination will be implemented in real time in a computer program small enough to be part of an implanted anti-tachycardia or defibrillating device.  We will first examine and describe in both the time and frequency domains the characteristic features of electrograms recorded during provocative electrophysiologic study in animals and humans.  Then we will develop computer algorithms for signal processing of the electrograms and for arrhythmia pattern recognition.  Finally, we will test the stated hypotheses by conducting additional animal and human electrophysiology studies and determining the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms. Our approach combines the engineering skill of computer-based signal analysis with the medical skill of diagnostic cardiac electrophysiology. It is our expectation that this approach will provide a sound scientific basis upon which development of specific hardware by pacemaker manufacturers can proceed.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION FOR ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCES We propose to continue (A) the development of mathematical, statistical and computer methods for the analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences and (B) the application of these methods.  The comparison of two and more informational sequences is central to many problems in molecular biology. (1) Finding consenting patterns that define genetic control regions or that determine structure or function are important examples of sequence comparisons.  An algorithm already developed by my group will be developed further and applied to several new data sets, such as Pol II promoters and RNA splice signals.  Careful data analyses should suggest new modifications to the method.  New and nontrivial insights into promoter patterns, for example, could result from an unbiased, rigorous analysis with calculated significance levels.  (2) Secondary structure of 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA has been inferred by the phylogenetic method.  Consensus and probability results will be developed to solve this problem in a rigorous way.  Again, new information about secondary structure could result.  (3) T1 catalogs are available for 16S rRNA from many organisms.  A careful analysis, based on pattern and significance of found patterns, will be made.  This will constitute a new and entirely unbiased study of divisions such as archaebacteria, eukaryotes, and eubacteria.  (4) Recent important results have been established for the exact (extreme value) distribution of long exact matches between random sequences.  These distributions are fundamental to pattern recognition in general and allow statistical assessment of found patterns.  The distributions will be extended to include results of long matching where mismatches and insertion/deletions are allowed.

"CANCER PROTEIN DATA BASE High resolution two dimensional electrophoresis allows a large fraction of the estimated 30,000 to 50,000 human proteins to be identified by map position and to be quantitated.  Normal and cancer cells have been mapped in orienting studies and many differences found.  To give meaning to these results, and to systematically exploit them, a large data base (the Cancer Protein Data Base) including all available and all obtainable data on each spot is required, with the data base directly linked to CRT map displays. The data base will include (for each protein) intracellular location, types of cells in which found, names, functions, disease correlations, biophysical data, literature citations, membership in coregulated sets, differentiational stage of occurrence, and chromosomal location of the coding gene.  The theses to be explored are that cells are highly integrated systems to be understood in terms of protein sets and the regulational circuits involving them, and that compositional changes in cancer cells are not random, but reflect alterations in normal regulational and differentiational functions.

"TAPERED LINEAR ARRAY FOR ULTRASOUND HYPERTHERMIA The overall goal of this project is to complete the development and to test a novel ultrasonic tapered linear phased array applicator for hyperthermia treatment.  Such an applicator will allow electronic steering of the focus along a desired path without the use of a mechanical scanning system and will remain fixed relative to the patient, making coupling easier.  The applicator will be computer controlled such that the scan path and/or intensity can be altered at any time during treatment to maintain a constatn uniform tumor temperature.  Such a system is expected to meet the requirements for controlled local hyperthermia treatment of deep-seated tumors.  Each element of the phased array applicator (64 in all) will be driven by a modular high-power multichannel RF generator similar to that used in the URI Therm-X, Inc. Sonotherm 1000 ultrasound hyperthermia system.  Initial testing of the applicator will consist of experimentally acquiring field plots and comparing them to the theoretically predicted plots.  Once satisfied that the experimental phased array applicator is generating fields as expected theoretically, and that these fields are such that they should be adequate for hyperthermia applications, tests on phantoms will be initiated.  Finally, the performance of the prototype applicator which electronically scans its focus will be compared to that of a mechanically scanned, fixed focus applicator for various scan patterns. If the proposed prototype ultrasonic phased array applicator exhibits heating performance and control commensurate with clinical needs, Phase II development will be devoted to the construction and animal testing of clinical prototype system in preparation for clinical trials.

"MICROWAVE PHASED ARRAY FOR HYPERTHERMIA CANCER THERAPY The goal of this project is to develop a prototype microwave phased array applicator for local tumor hyperthermia therapy.

However, current designs for microwave applicators heat only superficial tumors and must be mechanically moved in order to change the power distribution in the tumor and surrounding normal tissues.  The specific aims of the proposed Phase I study are designed to develop new techniques for producing local tumor hyperthermia using microwaves. Preliminary studies have resulted in a new design for a microwave phased array hyperthermia applicator.  The proposed Phase I studies will allow development of this existing design into a working prototype microwave hyperthermia applicator system.  This applicator system will consist of a microwave phased array applicator, a microwave power amplifier and distribution network, and a computer control system for the applicator. This new microwave phased array applicator system will have the capability of focusing microwave energy more effectively in tissue than presently available clinical devices and the location of the focus will be electronically rather than mechanically scanned in order to produce a uniform tumor temperature distribution without overheating surrounding normal tissues.

"PROTEIN MARKERS OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA The molecular events associated with the development of renal cell carcinoma are essentially unknown and useful biochemical markers for this tumor are not available.  High-resolution protein separation techniques have been used in preliminary experiments to identify a group of proteins which are associated with the tumor, but absent or significantly reduced in normal renal cortex.  This application has as its long-term objective the understanding of the role these proteins play in the expression of the malignant phenotype and the determination of whether serum, urine, or tissue assays for these proteins are of clinical relevance.  The first specific aim of this proposal concerns the production of monoclonal antibodies to these proteins through the immunization of mice with protein spots cut from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, a recently developed technique.  The second aim deals with the use of these antibodies to help isolate and characterize the proteins as to molecular weight, subunit composition, glycosylation, cellular localization, and tissue specificity. These studies will use two-dimensional electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, and immunohistochemical staining.  The third specific aim deals with the evaluation of three established renal cell carcinoma-derived cell lines as model systems.  Quantitative computer-aided pattern analysis will be used to compare two-dimensional gels of the cultured cells and tumor tissue, and immunologic methods will also be used to confirm the presence or absence of the carcinoma-associated proteins in the cultured cells.  Specific aim four will be to determine by immunoassay if any of the carcinoma-associated proteins or circulating antibodies to these proteins are present in the serum of patients with this tumor.  If so, preliminary studies will be initiated to determine the potential clinical usefulness for the detection, staging, or typing of renal tumors.  The studies outlined here should provide fundamental information about the biochemistry, cell biology, and clinical chemistry of a group of proteins associated with renal cell carcinoma and provide the necessary tools and information to pursue one or several of these proteins in greater detail in the future.  Moreover, should clinically useful markers be developed, this would point the way towards the use of these same methods in other tumor systems.

"DERIVING KNOWLEDGE FROM CLINICAL DATABASES The major concern of the RX Project is with the development of tools for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of health care data. Specifically, the objectives of the project are 1) to increase the validity and ease of data analysis and interpretation and 2) to facilitate the process of hypothesis generation and preliminary confirmation.  The principal focus of our research will continue to be on the RX Study Module.  Utilizing an on-line knowledge base of clinical medicine and of statistical procedures, the Study Module is designed to assist a researcher with the task of creating a comprehensive, mathematically correct study design using appropriate data from a large clinical database.  The Study Module determines an overall study design choosing between cross-sectional and longitudinal methods, it determines significant confounding variables and methods for controlling them, it determines patient eligibility criteria, and it formulates a mathematical model for testing the hypothesis.  Finally, the Study Module automatically runs the study design on a statistical package and assists with the interpretation of results.  A second focus of our work is in methods for aiding hypothesis generation. We seek to facilitate this process by developing improved means for labeling and accessing patient records.  We are also interested in developing methods for automating the dicovery of hypotheses by using methods from the field of artificial intelligence.

"SYMPTOM EVOLUTION IN APHASIA: A NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY Two related projects are proposed as part of an application for a Research Career Development Award.  First, it is suggested that information about the evolution of patients' symptoms during recovery from aphasia will provide an important source of constraint on the postulation of explanatory models to account for particular aphasis syndromes.  Three separate experimental batteries are developed to investigate the nature of the underlying deficit in agrammatic Broca's aphasia, conduction aphasia and anomic aphasia.  Specific hypotheses are developed concerning the possible relationships among co-occuring symptoms and their underlying basis. Patients meeting the selection criteria will be tested at several intervals over the course of the first year post-onset using one of the experimental batteries.  A second project is proposed to develop a computer-based system for the simulation and classification of reading and writing errors produced by dyslexic and dysgraphic patients.

"SIMULATION OF MENTAL PROCESSES IN LIGHT OF THE BRAIN This project is aimed at the development of explicit computational models of perceptual and cognitive processes, relying on mechanism which are consistent with what is known about the physiology and anatomy of the brain.  Recent work simulating perceptual and cognitive processes indicates that this is a fertile path to follow, but to do this adequately I need to learn more about the brain and more about the simulation of the kinds of computational processes which seem consistent with what goes on in the brain.  The first two years of this award would be devoted primarily to obtaining this background, as well as to research applying what I would be learning to a process at the interface between perception and cognition--namely reading.  Before the start of the career development award I plan to obtain some basic background in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and computer simulation techniques used in artificial intelligence.  I plan to spend the first year of the award at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Massachusetts Institue of Technology, studying recent advances in the understanding of parallel computation, and working on the development of a neurally plausible simulation model of the visual aspects of reading.  I plan to spend the second year at the Aphasia Research Center of Boston University at the Boston Veterans Administration Hospital, rounding out my background in the neurological basis of cognition and beginning research designed to use the effects of brain damage as a way of finding out about the nature of the underlying processing system. Specifically, I would study the disturbance of word processing ability that arises in deep dyslexia a type of reading disability resulting from damage in certain ageas of the brain.  During the summer of the second year I also plan to participated in an advanced neurophysiology course such as the one offered at Cold Springs Harbor, Long Island.  The remaining three years of the career development award would be dedicated to the continued exploration of simulation models of cognitive and perceptual processes constructed in the light of what I would learn during the first two years; and to the writing of a book designed to help establish the approach of developing neurally plausible simulation models as a central part of the study of perceptual and cognitive processes.

We propose basic research into the representation and use of therapy-planning strategies of the type routinely employed by expert clinicians as they monitor and adjust the treatment for patients with serious disease entities.  In addition, we propose to implement and test these new techniques in the setting of an existing consultation system known as ONCOCIN.  The ONCOCIN program is an oncology protocol management system that encodes the knowledge of highly structured cancer chemotherapy protocols and gives advice on treatment. Although ONCOCIN is currently in routine experimental use by oncologists in the Stanford oncology clinic, the program is limited in its ability to manage patients who have unexpected responses to therapy.  A generalized approach to therapy planning that can be applied to ONCOCIN will broaden the system's scope and increase its clinical utility.  In summary, this proposal combines basic research in the representation of clinical knowledge with a useful application.  The specific aims of the research are:  (1) to conduct basic research into possible representations of the therapy planning process, particularly how plans are modified in response to unusual conditions prior to or during treatment cycles; (2) to develop a computer program to represent the therapy planning processes of expert clinicians; and (3) to interface the planning program with ONCOCIN.

"COMPUTER-BASED RESPIRATORY SUPPORT CONSULTANT The aggressive respiratory management protocols used in testing infants suffering from acute hyaline membrane disease (HMD) involves maintaining a delicate balance between meeting the infant's respiratory needs and avoiding the devastating long-term consequences of excessive airway pressures and oxygen.  Systematic use of all the knowledge affecting ventilator therapy decisions will improve the quality of care, particularly during periods when the most experienced clinicians are not present.  The objective of this project is to design and implement a computer-based system which will aid clinicians in providing appropriate respiratory support for infants suffering acute HMD.  The system will build on our previously developed computer-based HMD course and management model. Knowledge of treatment protocols and the therapeutic and diagnostic states under which each protocol operates will be derived from our current clinical practices.  This knowledge will be expressed as treatment and diagnostic rules and incorporated in a small knowledge-based system written in Turbo Prolog and implemented on a personal computer.  Such an approach allows flexible use of qualitative physiological and clinical knowledge to an extent which is difficult to achieve with traditional programming methods.  The resulting system can be modified and expanded to extend the domain of applicability to a broader population and improve the system's predictive accuracy.  This system will use readily available data (e.g. blood gases, respirator settings, physical signs) in conjunction with diagnostic rules to maintain a list of attributes reflecting an individual baby's current physiological and treatment status.  The system will search the treatment rules for all applicable therapy changes which could correct a given blood gas abnormality, and list the alternatives along with their side effects and the applicable rationale.  It will be a valuable tool in teaching the principles of ventilator management.  All details of the patient's state and each user interaction with the system will be stored and used in evaluating system performance.  This system should enhance the consistency of respiratory support by consistently applying a large body of timely clinical knowledge to each therapeutic decision.

"FETAL LUNG BIOCHEMISTRY AND 3-DIMENSIONAL MICROANATOMY During late fetal development, the lung must prepare for the transition to air breathing.  Maintaining alveolar stability becomes vital for survival. Therapy with glucocorticoids to enhance lung maturity may have immediate and long term consequences for lung structure and function.  This series of investigations is directed toward furthering our basic knowledge of lung secretory cell development.  We will use structural and biochemical methods to test hypotheses of secretory cell function and to test the probabilities that glucocorticoids damage fetal and newborn lung structure.  We intend to study biochemical and 3-dimensional morphologic changes during epithelial cell maturation in the last days of fetal development.  We will test hypotheses of the assembly of lamellar bodies and assess the changes in type II cell maturation induced by glucocorticoids.  This drug induced accelerated maturation is a relevant clinical concern as the effects are widespread within the lung and have not been shown to be entirely reversible during postnatal growth.  A detailed 3-dimensional morphologic study of groups of alveolar septa and of terminal bronchiolar structure will be conducted at allow magnification level that will test the microanatomic basis for theories of cell-cell interactions.

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.

"IMPROVEMENT OF DIGITAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF CORONARY ARTERIES Coronary arteriosclerosis is a leading cause of death in U.S., and it is to a large degree the presence or absence of severe coronary stenoses which determines the risk of death.  Because many patients who suffer from this disease are asymptomatic until their first attack, a safe, inexpensive diagnostic procedure for detecting coronary artery stenoses would be beneficial.  The diagnosis as currently carried out requires that a large catheter be inserted into the orifice of each artery in order to inject opaque dye to make the arteries visible with X rays.  The increased contrast sensitivity of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) permits a less invasive technique involving an injection into the aortic root, a smaller catheter, and reduced dye volumes, but it has been of only limited success largely because of image degradation caused by patient motion during image acquisition.  The aim of this project is to develop and test image processing algorithms for the improvement of digital angiography of coronary arteries.  The algorithms search for a geometrical transformation to produce an optimal registration of two images before subtraction.  They are based on a new application of the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics, a new class of transformation functions, a new method of machine calibration, and new application of search methods developed in the field of artifical intelligence for function optimization.  As a result these algorithms represent the first approach to image registration which is capable of handling true three dimensional warping.  The development and evaluation of the algorithms will be carried out on both a specially designed phantom and on data derived in a new way from patient studies. The patient studies will be acquired during angioplasty procedures in which an inflated balloon and catheter will serve as phantom arteries of known dimensions.  The availability of known phantoms located in the chest on a beating human heart will provide for the first time an opportunity for quantitative evaluation of the success of the image enhancement algorithms in a realistic environment.  Thus, the proposed research will employ new techniques of image registration with a new technique for image evaluation to the problem of reducing motion effects in digital subtraction angiography.

"CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall, long range objectives are to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the marmoset family (Callitrichidae), in social and sexual communication.  The scent marks of these primates encode messages on identify of species, subspecies, and individual as well as information relating to sexual and social status.  Scent mark material, a mixture of gland secretion, some urine and possibly genital discharge, is chemically complex and includes esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and hydrocarbons.  To date our analytical studies using high resolution capillary gas chromatography have not revealed any qualitative differences in the scent marks of animals which differ in their sex, subspecies or species.  Therefore, we have embarked on a study to evaluate quantitative differences in the scent mark constituents.  Studies are proposed to identify the concentration profiles of the components which define gender, subspecies and species.  Analysis by computerized pattern recognition techniques will target those components which are correlated with gender, subspecies and species.  Sophisticated GC/MS/DS instrumentation will then be employed as the major tool for identification and quantitation of the targeted components.  Their role in chemical communication will be tested by behavioral assay.  Bacterial studies will also be undertaken to establish the role of microbial action in the production of some of the highly volatile components.  Finally, studies aimed at the identification of previously unknown components of lower volatility will be carried out.  We anticipate that this research will eventually lead to a deciphering of the chemical code such that in the end it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations the wide variety of communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and a bacteriologist has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.  These studies follow logically from prior work of our laboratory.  To the best of our knowledge this research program, involving the very close collaboration of chemists, primatologists and bacteriologists to explore and define a chemical communication system in a primate species, is unique in the United States.

"VISUOMOTOR COORDINATION:  NEURAL NETWORKS AND SCHEMAS Our approach to analyzing mechanisms of visuomotor coordination is two-fold:  ""top-down"", to offer a coordinated control program of interacting schemas (concurrently active programs suitably structured for action-perception systems) to model behavior noted by neuroethologists; and ""bottom-up"", to provide detailed models of neural networks which are consistent with known anatomy and physiology, but which involve additional assumptions, amenable to experimental test, to yield a network capable of exhibiting appropriate behavior.  Where possible, we implement a family of models, rather than a single model, to facilitate computer experiments and animal experiments which may discriminate between alternative mechanisms.

"CUTANEOUS PATERN PERCEPTION The proposed research will investigate the perception of tactile patterns by human subjects.  The tactile patterns will be generated on arrays of stimulators that fit against the subject's fingertips.  Each array consists of 144 stimulators arranged in a matrix 6 columns by 24 rows.  Sets of patterns differing along such dimensions as location, intensity, number of line segments, and so forth will be generated and presented to subjects. Response measures will include identification, discrimination, reaction time, and pattern matching.  Three aspects of tactile pattern perception will be examined:  masking, interactions among multiple sites of stimulation, and the role of experience.  A temporal masking paradigm will be used to see how the perception of tactile patterns is interfered with by tactile maskers and how the nature of the interference changes with changes in the type of masker and in the temporal separation between target and masker.  In the studies of interaction among multiple sites, patterns will be presented to as many as three sites on the fingertips and palm.  This paradigm will be used to assess the role of attention in tactile information processing. The role of short-term experience will be examined by measuring changes in pattern perception as subjects learn to identify and discriminate tactile patterns.  The effect of long-term experience will be evaluated by comparing the performance of groups of subjects who differ in the amount and nature of their experience with complex tactile patterns.  One group will be Optacon users, blind individuals who can read by means of a tactile array.  The other groups will be blind individuals without Optacon experience and several groups of sighted subjects with varying amounts of tactile experience.

"AUTOMATION OF DNA SEQUENCE DATA ENTRY DNA sequence determination has become a standard method for the characterization of newly isolated genes.  Recent advances in the technology for the determination of DNA sequences have allowed large amounts of data to accumulate rapidly.  However, methods for transferring that data into the computer, where it is to be analysed, are still far from ideal, in that they require considerable manual interention.  We propose to develop a highly automated system that will greatly increase the accuracy and the speed with which sequence data can be collected and analysed.  The method requires first producing a digital image of the sequencing radioautogram.  Algorithms will then be devised that are able to convert that ditigized data into a DNA sequence.  A key feature of the software for this interpretative step is that it will operate according to a set of heuristic procedures that are clearly defined and which can easily be modified and extended.  When these rules fail to provide an unambiguous interpretion then operator assistance will be requested to make a final decision.  An important consequence of the strategy is that the primary data upon which the DNA sequence depends will be available in machine-readable form.  Appropriate software will be developed to manage this primary data and to assist in the resolution of discrepancies that may arise during the course of a sequencing project.  The software tools that will be developed during the course of this project would have additional applications for the interpretation of all kinds of biological data that derive from gel electrophoretic techniques.

"ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS IN OCULAR INFLAMMATORY DISEASES Our goal is the prevention of blindness and morbidity associated with inflammatory eye diseases, particularly trachoma and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.  The studies proposed on trachoma will examine in detail the variations in host response to a single well characterized organism (Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the eye).  It will allow us to evaluate response of the external eye to infection and the variations in disease that are intrinsic or induced (e.g. atopy or depressed cellular immunity.  the grading of host repsonse (trachoma intensity) and microbial load (number of chlamydial elementary bodies) provide a quantitative system to study this interaction of host and environmental factors.  In the studies of chlamydial infections we will (1) initiate studies on the role of individual host response to chlamydial infection; (2) elucidate the role of Chlamydia trachomatis as a cause of other illness in trachoma endemic areas; (3) evaluate new technology for the diagnosis of ocular chlamydial infections; (4) develop and validate simplified diagnostic techniques for endemic trachoma; (5) continue limited treatment trials for the prevention of blindness from trachoms.  The major theme of these studies on trachoma will be an evaluation of the host response to infection of the conjunctiva.  An important intermediate goal will be the identification of those host factors that are associated with the blingind consequences of trachoma.

"CONTEXT INFORMATION IN AUTOMATED CERVICAL SMEAR ANALYSIS The overall aim of this project is to improve automated cervical smear image analysis techniques sufficiently to:  1) routinely provide additional diagnostic information to supplement that provided by human visual examination, and 2) provide accurate, cost effective prescreening capabilities.  By furnishing additional quantitative diagnostic information, such automated systems would permit the practicing cytopathologist to make more accurate and refined diagnostic judgements, which would lead to improved patient management.  By providing a practical prescreening capability, such systems would increase the efficiency and efficacy of health care delivery.  Current automated cervical smear analysis research employs only the analysis of isolated cells, and practical automated analysis is not yet a reality.  The primary contribution of this project will be the completion of development and testing of image analysis techniques that extract information from cells and other objects as seen in the context of the ""background"" of the smear.  Specifically, cells, cell clusters, bare nuclei, and cytoplasmic fragments are analyzed and the resulting contextual features, slide-averaged ""features"" and high-resolution features describing single cells are combined to produce a more complete and accurate description of the smear.  This description will provide information not obtainable by human visual analysis, which can be used, 1) directly, to ascertain diagnostic clues, and 2) indirectly to make accurate prescreening possible.  An extensive pilot study has shown that the contextual analysis provides complementary information to that provided by single cell analysis.  That is, where single cell analysis seems to have difficulty, contextual analysis is most accurate - and vice versa. Thus we expect to demonstrate that the combination of our contextual analysis techniques with single cell analysis will give automated Pap smear analysis the additional screening accuracy that is needed.  The proposed project is a followup intended to:  a) validate the techniques of the pilot study, b) to expand the study to include parameters that provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information, and c) to generate specifications for a system to accomplish the analysis in a routine clinical laboratory environment.

"STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY AND TARGETED DRUG DESIGN FOR AIDS This proposal will focus on the use of structural biology to aid in the development of drugs that can interfere in a specific manner with protein products of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome.  Since HIV is the etiological agent implicated in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), it is hoped that these drugs will cure or at least arrest the symptoms of AIDS. Finding a cure for AIDS in an extremely urgent health priority for the world.  However, it can be anticipated that the methodologies developed in this AIDS-targeted project could lay the foundations for the development of other anti-viral agents that inevitably will evolve in the future to plaque mankind.  Inhibitors will be developed toward several HIV proteins:  the reverse transcriptase, the protease, the integrase and the ribonuclease H activity of the reverse transcriptase. Recombinant methods for viral protein production will be developed.  These proteins, as well as viral proteins obtained from external sources, as appropriate, will be highly purified, crystallized and subjected to X-ray diffraction (or NMR) analysis.  The emerging structures will be modeled using computer graphics, and potential inhibitors will in turn be modeled into the structures using molecular mechanics, quantum mechanics and artificial intelligence.  Candidate inhibitors will be synthesized, tested with enzyme systems, and sometimes co-crystallized with the enzyme for further structural analysis.

"COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISE IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is a research project that aims to develop computer-assisted instructional tools for clinical science education in medicine.  A computer system will be developed that consists of two related programs:  DSS, a user-friendly decision support system, based on the concepts of clinical decision analysis and medical cost-effectiveness analysis; and PLAN-ALYZER, an interactive critiquing system based on the concepts of automated transition networks.  Methods to be employed in the development of the system will arise from decision theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.  The primary computer system that will be used for the project is the Apple Macintosh.  The computer system will be applied to clinical problems in two content areas of second year medical education:  the workup of anemias in hematology and the evaluation and management of suspected coronary artery disease in cardiology.  Databases will be developed for each of these areas, drawing upon the resources of clinical medicine, community and family medicine, and laboratory medicine.  The effect of the computer tool in these two areas will be tested through a randomized, controlled crossover trial in three medical school classes.  Students will be stratified by sex and MCAT Verbal and Quantitative scores into two randomized groups.  The first group will undergo the hematology intervention, and serve as a control group for the cardiology exercise. The other group will serve in reverse.  Experimental subjects will undergo a laboratory exercise using the DSS and PLAN-ALYZER programs; control subjects will receive refined textual material that is equivalent in content.  Performance will be measured by patient evaluation problems built into the examination mechanism of the medical school in the randomized design.  Additionally, student performance will be measured over time, both within the second year intervention and through two repeat interventions in the clinical years of medical school.  The project aims to investigate whether computer science research in basic medical education will assist the integration of discrete medical facts into effective clinical decision making, both in the classroom environment and through clinical training.

"SIMULATION OF MENTAL PROCESSIS IN LIGHT OF THE BRAIN I propose to continue my explorations of parallel distributed processing models of cognitive processes.  These models are based on the idea that information processing activity grows out of the interactions of large numbers of simple processing units, and that learning is based on the adjustment of the strengths of the connections among the units.  The work is aimed primarily at modeling psychological phenomena in a computationally adequate way, though it draws its inspiration from and is ultimately applicable to our developing understanding of how information processing actually takes place in the brain.  Two main areas of research are described, one in the area of language processing and one in the area of network learning mechanisms.  In the area of language processing, I plan to carry out a series of studies on sentence comprehension designed to test and elaborate three basic principles of language understanding, and to develop a simulation model based on these principles.  In the area of network learning mechanisms, I describe a new network learning algorithm, and describe plans to try to bring the further development of this and related algorithms together with neurophysiological investigations of a) adaptation to changes in environmental input and b) of the laws that govern synaptic change as studied through experiments on long-term potentiation.

"PHOTOINDUCED THROMBOTIC STROKE--MECHANISMS AND THERAPY The major goal of this project is to document patterns of platelet deposition, blood flow and edema during the development of focal thrombotic stroke, and the effects of prophylactic agents on mitigating or inhibiting thrombus formation in brain vasculature.  A secondary goal is to determine whether lipid peroxidation is associated with thrombotic stroke, and to characterize the distribution of lipid peroxides in parenchyma and endothelium of the affected tissue zone and correlate this with morphological indices as the stroke progresses.  The proposed studies will utilize our recently characterized model of reproducible focal cerebral infarction precipitated by photochemically induced thrombosis of cortical vasculature, in rats injected systemically with the potent photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal.  The progression of thrombosis will be represented by platelets radiolabeled with IIIindium, and local cerebral blood flow will be evaluated by 14C-labeled iodoantipyrine imaging.  Microvascular occlusion will be visualized directly by carbon-black perfusion.  The effect on these parameters of agents known to mitigate thrombosis of single vessels in vivo will be evaluated in the present context of a network of occluded vasculature; such agents include calcium channel antagonists (nimodipine, nifedipine, verapamil), antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, indomethacin, prostacyclin), free radical scavengers (ethanol, dimethylsufoxide, glycerol) and the clot-specific fibrinolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA).  Enhancement of the effect of t-PA by prior administration of lys-plasminogen will be tested also.  The hypothesis that lipid peroxidation inhibits the recovery of tissue compromised by ischemia can be studied if lipid peroxide formation can be induced in specific tissue zones.  In this model it is likely that platelet adhesion and subsequent aggregation are stimulated by photochemical peroxidation of endothelial lipids.  Owing to the reproducible progression of blood flow deficit in the photoinduced lesion, the present model may facilitate stable conditions for lipid peroxidation, observable as conjugated dienes, in the parenchyma as well.  The relative content (predicted to be low) of endothelial lipid peroxides, and the efficiency of photochemical induction of endothelial defects will be determined by similar experiments conducted with endothelial cells in culture.  The proposed work enables rigorous study of the thrombotic process and its mitigation under well-controlled condition in brain microvessels, with consequent benefit to potential stroke patients.

"KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM FOR CARDIAC IMAGE INTERPRETATION The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop a clinically useful, computer-based methodology to assist in decision-making tasks in medical imaging.  The methodology consists of a novel approach combining well-established mathematical methods and artificial intelligence techniques for simultaneously representing medical knowledge and handling visual information.  The specific aims of the proposed research are to develop, implement, test, and validate a knowledge-based system for interpreting three-dimensional thallium-201 myocardial distributions obtained by tomographic imaging.  These interpretations will assist clinicians in detecting and localizing coronary artery disease.  The research will be carried out in a collaboration between Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, thus providing a unique, interdisciplinary, and interinstitutional approach that directs complementary clinical and scientific resources toward this important medical problem. The five-year research program consists of four projects, dealing with (1) knowledge representation, (2) image understanding, (3) clinical acceptance and validation, and (4) system extension and refinement.  Preliminary studies indicate that the methodology can provide both accurate cardiac image interpretations and graphical, computer-generated representations of arterial structure.  The approach can serve as a clinically useful model with applications to other imaging modalities, and can also be used as a tool for tutoring and training clinicians.  The knowledge-based system is designed to be sufficiently extensible and flexible to accommodate the far-term objectives of eventually providing decision-making support to clinicians in tasks associated with diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis.

"LONG-TERM PLASMA EXCHANGE IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEM The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very massive reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.  The substantial decrease and improved long term control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol by RPE coupled with hypocholesterolemic drugs should amplify the preliminary evidence which has indicated that regression of early femoral atherosclerosis and nonprogression of advanced coronary lesions can be achieved by drug treatment alone in heterozygous FH.  We propose to undertake long-term (four years) RPE at two week intervals in fifteen heterozygous subjects with FH.  Pretreatment and within treatment coronary atheromatous lesions and ventricular function and perfusion will be assessed by serial quantitative, computerized coronary angiography, rest and exercise Thallium-201 perfusion studies, respectively.  The effectiveness of RPE will be judged not only by longitudinal studies of the plasma exchange group, but also in a randomized concurrent control group of subjects receiving only maximal drug therapy.  In addition, comparison will also be made against two groups of patients (historical controls) selected by Dr. John Brensike from the type II coronary intervention study recently completed at the NIH.  These patients will be selected using the same criteria for entry into this study and will have been treated with diet alone or diet plus cholestyramine.  The subjects will have undergone cardiac catheterization at the start of the study, at two years after entry, and at five years after entry.  In effect, therefore, the results of repeat coronary angiography in fifteen patients who undergo massive reductions in plasma cholesterol by REP plus maximal drug therapy will be compared to three control groups: a randomized concurrently treated group (diet plus maximal drug therapy), and two historical NIH concurrently treated groups (one with dietary treatment only, and a group on diet plus cholestyramine).

"ALGORITHMS FOR ARRHYTHMIA IDENTIFICATION Our general goal is automatic identification of arrhythmias within implantable devices by computer-based signal processing of the intracardiac electrograms.  This goal appears to be realizable because:  1) the arrhythmias to be identified can be provoked in the catheter electrophysiology laboratory and the resulting electrograms can be recorded for detailed analysis; 2) modern signal processing techniques exist for characterizing the electrograms in the time domain and by spectral content; 3) computer algorithms can be designed to recognize these characteristic electrogram features in each arrhythmia; 4) implantable microcomputers are available in which the algorithms can be implemented.  An important premise of this proposal is that the hardware for electrical termination of arrhythmia is already availbale and thus there is a risk of new generations of devices being implanted for arrhythmia control before the underlying electrophysiologic concepts and pattern recognition rules for identifying the arrhythmia are developed and tested.  The signal processing algorithms and decision rules for automatic detection and discrimination will be implemented in real time in a computer program small enough to be part of an implanted anti-tachycardia or defibrillating device.  We will first examine and describe in both the time and frequency domains the characteristic features of electrograms recorded during provocative electrophysiologic study in animals and humans.  Then we will develop computer algorithms for signal processing of the electrograms and for arrhythmia pattern recognition.  Finally, we will test the stated hypotheses by conducting additional animal and human electrophysiology studies and determining the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms. Our approach combines the engineering skill of computer-based signal analysis with the medical skill of diagnostic cardiac electrophysiology. It is our expectation that this approach will provide a sound scientific basis upon which development of specific hardware by pacemaker manufacturers can proceed.

"IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON INDUSTRIAL INSPECTOR STRESS The objective of this research is to determine how both human stress and human performance vary with the level of automation in an industrial inspection job.  Industry is demanding higher quality of its workers and of its inspectors who are charged with maintaining and monitoring that quality.  At the same time, sophisticated automation is becoming available to extend the human inspector's capabilities on some tasks within the inspection job.  Inspection is known to be a stressful job and, with these two trends, a job which is likely to increase in stressfulness.  A machine, called a Color Video Comparator or CVC, will be used to obtain six levels of inspection automation from unaided human inspection through automated display, sequencing and pacing to a pattern-recognition algorithm.  Performance and task stress will be measured in a laboratory task of inspection printed circuit boards for eight subjects at each level of automation.  The procedure follows one already performed successfully at one level for the Western Electric Company.  This company will supply the CVC and the circuit boards used in the study.  Parts of the laboratory study will be replicated using inspectors at two Western Electric plants so that differences between task stress and job stress can be measured.  The results of the project will be of value to designers of automated and semi-automated systems as they will help to specify the level of automation which gives the best balance between system performance and operator stress.

"A RELIABLE, SIMPLE, ELECTRONIC PNEUMATIC PUMP ACTUATOR The goal of the proposed program is the development of a portable, reliable, and simple electromagnetic pump driver for pneumatically actuated blood pump systems.  This driver eliminates compressors, pressure regulators, solenoid valves, sliding seals, or any components subject to mechanical wear.  The basis of the design is an electromagnetically driven welded metal bellows.  The total excursion and rate of movement of the bellows are electronically controlled using a closed-loop network which monitors bellows position and internal pressure.  This microprocessor-based control system permits flexible operating modes including fixed rate, autonomous variable rate, passive synchronous, and EKG triggered synchronous counterpulsation at any desired stroke volume.  It also allows for direct specification of the pressurization envelope to the blood pump, eliminating excessive systolic rates of pressurization or high diastolic negative pressures, either of which can produce hemolysis.  By virtue of its extreme mechanical simplicity, the driver is inherently reliable.  Its target electromechanical efficiency of 20% will also result in a compact and portable pump driver that is low in cost compared to the bulky or mechanically complex systems currently available.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE DATABASES The proposed work focuses on searching large nucleic acid sequence databases for functionally, structurally, and evolutionarily significant patterns.  There is a need to develop efficient and biologically relevant strategies for defining higher- order patterns and for using the defined pattern as a basis for searches through nucleic acid sequence databases (e.g., the GenBank database).  We will design and install on the Cray computer an improved set of algorithms that will:  (1) use a hash function to rapidly scan large databases for evidence of local similarity; (2) use a rigorous measure to find and score the best local alignments; (3) dynamically filter significant scores; and (4) store the results of the scan in a dynamically maintained database of similarity scores.  The increased speed and reduced cost of these algorithms will allow us to examine in greater detail variations in measures (on both nucleic acid and protein levels) of similarity; the programs will be well suited to the large-scale sequence comparison projects being planned for the Crays becoming available to the molecular biology research community.  We will develop an improved method for recognizing potential donor and acceptor sites for intron sequences.  We will re- examine the notion of ""consensus sequence"" donor and acceptor patterns as well as define additional attributes that distinguish these patterns.  These measures will be combined through discriminant analysis to create an algorithm that predicts whether or not a potential donor or acceptor site is functional.  We will develop a general approach for scanning large databases for structural patterns, initially in the context of a search for potential curved DNA sequences.  First we will develop useful measures for gauging curvature in DNA, and then test the predictions of the Tung-Harvey model by comparison with experimental results for curved DNA.  With the established measures and model, we will scan the GenBank database for anomalously curved regions, and determine whether or not they are correlated with the functional roles of coincident or neighboring sequences.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPH NODE DISEASES We seek support to (1) investigate fundamental issues in applications of artificial intelligence to medicine within the context of lymph node pathology and (2) construct a useful diagnostic system for the hematopathology field.  The complexity of hematopathology poses a rich set of challenges for artificial intelligence in medicine.  Our research addresses fundamental problems of knowledge representation, reasoning strategies, user modeling, explanation, and user acceptance.  Our goal is to build a useful decision system for pathologists.  Such a working system would be extraordinarily useful for the lymph node pathology field.  Many studies have documented that there are major problems in the diagnosis and classification of malignant lymphomas and they are often confused with benign diseases.  This poses a major problem for the oncologist as accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment.  We have built a prototype experty system called PATHFINDER which makes diagnoses of lymph node pathology through a consideration of 50 malignant and 30 benign diseases and approximately 500 histopathologic findings.  The program uses the method of sequential diagnosis; it can generate differential diagnoses based on a small number of findings and can suggest other findings useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis.  Consensus meetings have already resulted in agreement on features and diseases to be used by the program. Our research plans are to further develop PATHFINDER so that it can become not only a regularly used diagnostic tool for users having different levels of training and experience, but also can serve as a powerful teaching system.  The proposed expert system will provide a unique integrated knowledge base for the benign diseases of lymph nodes.  AIDS, and lymphomas giving the practicing pathologist immediate access to accurate morphologic classification and diagnostic criteria, while at the same time providing guidance as to whether additional tests (immunologic, cytogenetic, cell-kinetic, and immunogenetic) are likely to be informative.  It is anticipated that a working diagnostic system could improve the reproducibility and reliability of lymphoma diagnosis, facilitate the standardization of diagnoses in clinical trials, and help ensure appropriate therapy at the community hospital level.  We plan to substantially increase the quantity and quality of knowledge through (1) the integration of independent knowledge bases from the four experts mentioned above, (2) the integration of laboratory, clinical, immunologic, cell kinetic, cytogenetic, and immunogenetic information, and (3) the restructuring of the knowledge base to include dependencies among features.  Furthermore, we will (4) facilitate the identification of morphologic features and standardize definitions of features and diseases by incorporating detailed textual and pictorial descriptions (using videodisk technology), (5) develop mapping schemes that will facilitate the understanding of the many classification systems for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and (6) implement methods for the detection of multiple discordant histologies, progression of disease over time, and atypical proliferation.  Also, we will implement and incorporate into the program (1) scoring methods when features are interdependent, (2) heuristics for high-level control of reasoning strategies, (3) heuristics which customize the bahavior of the program to the expertise of the user, (4) formal decision analysis techniques, and (5) methods for system explanation. Throughout the three year period, we will also monitor our progress through iterative testing of reasoning strategies and frequent validations of the program's knowledge.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CLINICAL DECISION MAKING This proposal is to develop an integrated program for the representation of complex knowledge and reasoning processes in medicine, using the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) and decision analysis (DA).  The project will address problems in both diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning in two medical domains: coronary disease, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. The planned large-scale AI system will incorporate a common knowledge representation formalism and alternative reasoning programs to do data interpretation, hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing and revision, diagnostic query planning, therapeutic planning and automatically-generated explanations.  DA reasoning will be integrated into the system, especially to improve the test and treatment planning components.  A uniform knowledge base will be developed in the two identified medical domains, utilizing knowledge acquired from the analysis of protocols, expert opinion, case-based learning, hand-coded knowledge from the literature, and strictly limited attempts to automatically acquire structured knowledge from English free-text.  A panel of specific cases will be developed that can be used to validate additions to the knowledge base and changes in the reasoning components of the system.  A series of protocol analyses will be done, involving both diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in clinical settings where uncertainty and risk are predominant factors.  Specific attention will focus on the degree to which experienced clinicians rely on case-based reasoning and means will be developed to represent, index and utilize such case-based experience in the reasoning program.  A new generation of DA tools will be built to aid the construction of DA models for use in actual clinical settings.  These tools will utilize the same knowledge bases as the AI models, and will share with them the ability to look in varying depth of detail at problems and to generate explanations of their workings.  A set of template analyses dealing with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, renal transplantation, use of anticoagulant therapy and the timing of surgery for valvular heart disease, and a knowledge base of risk and prognosis estimates in these domains will also be constructed.

"DIGITAL VIEWING STATIONS FOR DIAGNOSTIC IMAGES The arrival of high speed digital electronic communication in radiological sciences is gradually changing the method of acquiring, communicating, storing, and viewing diagnostic images. One natural development due to this change is the emergence of the digital radiology department.  In the previous study we demonstrated the feasibility of such a development by designing and implementing two clinical multiple digital viewing stations in the Pediatric Radiology Section.  During this study related technological problems which had hindered such development were also solved.  They were:  (1) the conversion of conventional radiographic images into high resolution digital images by using a laser film scanner and a computed radiographic system, (2) development of a digital optical disk storage system for mass image storage, and (3) the installation of a broadband communication system for rapid networking of images.  The purpose of this research proposal is to continue this development and to have a complete digital-based operation in the Pediatric Radiology Section in the Radiological Sciences Department within five years.  This digital-based operation in the Pediatric Radiology Section includes patient registration, image acquisition, mass storage, network communication, and image viewing.  The first two years will be used for the integration of various components into a total digital viewing system and to gain clinical acceptance.  The third year will be for clinical trials of the complete digital-based operation.  The fourth year will be for phasing out of the film- based operation and extending the digital viewing system capabilities to the pediatric department and to the genitourinary radiology section.  The last year will be used for clinical evaluations and planning of the total digital viewing system for the entire department.  It is anticipated that this project will become a success because we have met all the technological requirements as well as have considered and studied the psychological implications of a digital review system.  The importance of building and evaluating such a digital viewing system as an alternate method for the current film-based operation is obvious since a successful execution of the current project will change the direction of viewing radiological images in the future.

"RADIOTRACER R & D IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND NEUROSCIENCE The availability of PET as a tool for research in biology and medicine has expanded significantly in the past decade along with the sophistication of the instrumentation and the diversity of radiotracers which are being applied to specific problems in biology and medicine.  The major scientific goal of this proposal is to address the key research issues in radiotracer chemistry and biochemistry which are required to accelerate the application of PET to new problems in biology and medicine.  Specific aims include high level economical production of fluorine-18 and carbon-11 on medical cyclotrons, mechanistic and synthetic chemistry as it relates to radiotracer synthesis and analytical control, radiotracer design and biochemistry as a linkage between PET measurements and the physiological process itself and automation of radiotracer production, and analysis including the use of knowledge-based artificial intelligence for rapid diagnosis of problems.  New radiotracers for assessing degree of malignancy in brain tumors by measuring functional ornithine decarboxylase activity (using 5-11C-ornithine) will be developed.  A new approach to radiotracer design, the use of 11C-labeled suicide inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) to assess functional enzyme activity initiated during this grant period will be further exploited.  The introduction of a major new thrust, the use of PET as a scientific tool in pharmaceutical research and development for new therapeutic drugs, will begin with the synthesis of positron emitter labeled drugs such as (11C) midazolam, a recently introduced benzodiazepine receptor active drug used in pre-anesthetic sedation.  Because of the growing importance of fluorine-18 for high resolution PET studies, and for measuring biological processes over a time interval of several hours, new approaches to its economical production in high yield on medical cyclotrons employing reusable solid 18O-targets and its efficient incorporation into a wide spectrum of 18F-tracers through the general synthesis of 3-(18F) fluoropropyl derivatives of biologically active compounds will be developed.  This research which is motivated by the use of PET compounds will be developed.

"PERCEIVING STRUCTURE IN EVENTS The aim of this project is to identify the means by which human observers organize moving structures and perceive them as dynamic wholes.  The particular moving structures used will be computer-generated displays of dots that, in their movement, mimic human walkers, rolling wheels, and other everyday events.  Previous research has shown that these displays yield robust percepts, despite their relative impoverishment of seen elements.  And the dearth of elements involved allows simple and concise mathematical description.  This project will proceed on three fronts.  The first will study perceptual organization with a particular focus on how much time is needed to organize a dynamic stimulus.  Brief displays of systems of dots will be displayed for varying amounts of time in order to assess the durations necessary for the identification of familiar movements of near-familiar objects.  The second will study perceptual organization with a focus on the effectiveness of various kinds of camouflage in inhibiting identification of common objects in motion.  Static and dynamic camouflages of several types will be employed, with a particular emphasis on the movement parameters of a dynamic camouflage that are most effective in interfering with identification.  The third will study perception organization with a focus on the information available about movement in iconic memory.  Previous research has shown that such information is available, and the nature of the coded form of that information will be assessed.  The idea is that if information about many parameters of movement is available as early as the icon, then the perceiver is clearly attuned to that information and appears not to need to elaborate it in a computational fashion.  The disciplines involved in this study are, primarily, psychology and visual perception, and, secondarily, artificial intelligence and computer simulation.  The health relatedness of this project is to be measured in terms of understanding the normal function of the human visual/perceptual system, both in situations of natural complexity and in reduced complexity such as when viewing elements on radar screens, and when watching for pedestrians crossing the streets at night.

"MASS SPECTROMETRY IN ORGANIC AND BIOCHEMISTRY The application of various mass spectrometric techniques to structure elucidation of three classes of biologically important natural products will be studied.  The first group encompasses novel marine sterols, which differ primarily from terrestrial sterols in the nature of their unusual (elongated or branched) side chains.  This feature appears to be of importance in cell membrane function and a detailed knowledge of the mass spectral fragmentation pattern of such sterol types is needed for structural elucidation of novel and as yet unidentified sterols of marine organisms.  Much of this work requires synthesis of requisite sterol reference compounds or synthetic verification of postulated structure.  The second group of natural products deals with the unusual phospholipids isolated from marine organisms.  Much less is known about the mass spectrometric behavior of this biologically important class of natural products as compared to sterols, and we intend to explore this field in detail by comparing different ionization techniques (electron impact vs. field desorption vs. chemical ionization vs. fast atom bombardment) since each is likely to provide special structural information on specific portions of the phospholipid molecule.  Since the novel marine phospholipids are particularly unusual in the context of their unprecedented fatty acid components (usually polyunsaturated), work is also envisaged on the mass spectrometric location of such double bonds in long-chain fatty acids.  Finally, we intend to develop mass spectral procedures (notably through the use of chemical ionization mass spectrometry with hydrogen gas) in the porphyrin field with the aim of accomplishing an as yet largely unrealized goal, namely the location of chemical substituents in the four different pyrrole rings of the prophyrin molecule solely through the use of mass spectrometry.  If successful, this should not only make an important contribution to porphyrin chemistry, but should also help greatly in drug metabolism studies involving cytochrome P-450.

"DYNAMIC PATTERNS IN COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS This proposal seeks funding for a newly established Center for Complex Systems at Florida ATlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida.  The main scientific goal of the Center is to understand how a complex biological system containing very many degrees of freedom (e.g. neurons, muscles, vascular processes) generates ordered behavior or macroscopic, spatiotemporal patterns.  This problem is attacked on several levels of description by virtue of a direct, on-site collaboration between theoretical physics (including computational modeling), psychology and neurobiology. Experimental test fields are pattern generation in biologically significant, multidegree of freedom activities such as speech and limb coordination in humans and the analysis of well-defined rhythmic behaviors (e.g. feeding) in Helisoma and Pleurobranchaea.  The theoretical backdrop comes from synergetics, originally a physical theory for the spontaneous formation of pattern in open, nonequilibrium systems, but which now encompasses other fields as well.  Synergetics promotes a search for the essential variables of the system under study that are characteristic of its collective state (the so-called order parameters).  It is these order parameters and their dynamics (including both deterministic and stochastic aspects) that will be used to explain specific pattern formation phenomena in biology studied here, including:  stability and loss of stability leading to behavioral change (e.g. switching among multiple states), synchronization, entrainment and learning.  Analytic tools pertaining to the stability of patterns (both kinematic and neuronal) and the time scales on which they persist will be developed, e.g. relaxation time and fluctuational measures.  Such observables enter into explicit modeling work that is computationally implemented.  A working assumption behind the Center's mission and the present proposal is that the tools and concepts of synergetics (nonlinear dynamics) may be appropriate at both macroscopic behavioral levels (e.g. in patterns among muscles and kinematic events) and at the microscopic scale of neuronal patterns.  If so, it may be possible to derive the former from the latter by appropriate coupling among their respective dynamics.  Apart from important technological applications, e.g., in prosthetics and robotics, a concerted effort to understand cooperative state and their dynamics in normal behavior seems justified if disordered states are to be better understood.

"DISCRETE VS. CONTINUOS MODELS OF VISUAL PERCEPTION Two very different types of models of visual perception have been used by researchers in the fields of cognitive psychology and human information processing.  Discrete models characterized visual perception as a discrete operation that must completely finish processing a stimulus before any further cognitive processes receive information about that stimulus (e.g., Sternberg, 1969a). Continuous models characterize it as a continuous operation that gradually transmits information about a stimulus to later cognitive processes, so that these processes can begin before perception is finished (e.g., McClelland, 1979).  It is important for both theoretical and methodological reasons to be able to discriminate between these two types of models, and the goal of the proposed research is to develop experimental tests that can choose between them.  The proposed experiments emphasize two lines of research.  One set of experiments will use psychophysiological measurements to look for evidence that some response preparation has occurred before stimulus perception has finished.  Previous studies have sought evidence of such preliminary response preparation using indirect measures based on total response latency, and results have been subject to alternative explanations.  Using electrophysiological measures including the electromyogram (EMG) and event-related cerebral potentials (ERPs), it should be possible to measure preliminary response preparation more directly.  These measures will be obtained in several different experimental paradigms yielding effects previously attributed to preliminary response preparation, and they will indicate whether such preparation is actually responsible for these effects.  Such preliminary response preparation would be consistent with continuous, but not discrete, models of perceptual processes.  The second set of experiments will use reaction time measurements to study visual attention.  If it can be established that attentional emphasis continuously modulates the output of perceptual processes (rather than their use by late processes), then this would constitute broad support for models with continuous rather than discrete activation of stimulus codes.  The results of these studies will be of interest to cognitive psychologists, human factors engineers and designers of interfaces for human/computer interaction, and researchers in some areas of artificial intelligence.

"DEVELOP A SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY LANGUAGE - MEDLISH Current scientific bibliographic databases (e.g., MEDLINE) now play a very central role in literature activities.  They are important and they are widely used.  However, the information expressed in the TITLE, ABSTRACT and MeSH INDEX fields in these databases is quite chaotic and sketchy compared with the structure of many other kinds of databases.  Because of these deficiencies, computerized literature searches are imprecise and merely retrieve records based on the presence of ""keywords,"" rather than via a precise ""match on concept"" condition, such as is possible with relational databases and other orderly data structures.  In this SBIR program we propose to make a small database containing the kind of information that is in ordinary abstracts, but to express it in a new ""scientific language"" (MEDLISH), that we (ISG) have been developing.  Unlike English, MEDLISH enforces order, scientific precision and logic on the entries.  At the conclusion of Phase I we will have completed the design, made a sample database, and finished the implementation plans.  In Phase II we then would make the marketable product.

"COMPUTER CONSULTANT FOR OPTIMAL NMR IMAGING Medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a new expensive imaging modality which avoids ionizing radiation and provides excellent diagnostic images.  The images produced depend on both the properties of the patient's tissues and the radiologist controlled parameters of the MRI scanner.  When scanner parameters are selected with clearcut objectives accounting for the patients's history, anatomic relationships and the MR properties of relevant tissues, accurate diagnostic images result. There are expert MRI radiologists who understand these tradeoffs, and use heuristic reasoning to simplify the mathematical and clinical complexity.  Their expertise can be encoded into a knowledge-based expert computer system.  Specifically, we propose to accomplish the following research:  1. Using existing methods of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, construct a first prototype expert system. It will be designed to incorporate the following functionality: o  Be a useful consultant for twenty representative situations involving the anatomy of the head, such as multiple sclerorsis, acoustic neuroma and pituitary adenoma. o  In a given clinical setting, produce a set of MR imaging parameters optimal for determining if a specific disease process is present. o  Be able to explain its reasoning in terms comprehensible to radiologists.  2.

"PHYSIOLOGIC KNOWLEDGE--ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS It has been recognized that one of the limitations of the ""first generation"" of medical artificial intelligence systems was the phenomenological nature of the knowledge to which they had access.  To perform effectively in difficult diagnostic and therapeutic situations, such programs will need knowledge bases which are sufficiently rich to enable them to reason about pathophysiological mechanisms.  Thus, the representation of the domain knowledge of physiology is becoming an important part of the development of such systems.  In this research, several problems inherent in representing and reasoning about complex physiological knowledge will be investigated in the context of developing a medical knowledge base and building a module which uses physiological reasoning to aid in evaluating diagnostic hypotheses and therapeutic plans.  The module will have access to a knowledge base which contains the domain knowledge of a subset of renal basic physiology, as well as clinical knowledge about fluid and electrolyte disturbances.  Its performance will be evaluated by integration into a system with components which generate diagnostic hypotheses, therapy plans, and explanations of the system's reasoning and output.  The following issues will be explored:  a. qualitative vs. quantitative representation of parameter values and qualitative reasoning or simulation vs. numerical calculation; b. temporal representation and reasoning; c. classification of causal mechanisms, with emphasis on concepts specific to the domain of physiology.  The above issues are relevant to the field of knowledge representation at large.  Thus, the proposed investigation may lead to the development of knowledge representation and reasoning techniques which are particularly adapted to the domain of renal physiology but may have wider applicability as well.

"AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF MUSCLE AND NERVE FIBERS A further continuation of an established, interdisciplinary research effort, between computer scientists and experts in neuromuscular disease, is proposed.  The long range goal of this entire project is to make quantitative morphometric analysis of muscle and nerve fibers more accurate, less tedious, and hence more available for research and clinical applications.  The specific aims of the project are directed towards developing and validating highly automated morphometric techniques to supplement or replace the manual histomorphometric methods that are currently used in the analysis of muscle and nerve biopsies.  Such automated techniques should prove to be more reliable and useful than their tedious and error-prone manual counterparts.  The methodology is sophisticated, computer assisted image analysis, with a strong emphasis on ""artificial intelligence"".  It also involves computer modeling.  Our system scans, digitizes, and analyzes muscle and nerve biopsies directly from slides, with minimal human interaction.  Results are monitored visually and resulting measurements and hard copy images are produced on simple dot-matrix printers.  During the first three years of this project, we determined optimal preparation methods, developed the relevant basic image analysis techniques and tested them on the representative tissue samples.  We also developed a novel measure of type grouping, the CDI, and developed a basic computer model of denervation/reinnervation.

"LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION RELATED TO LOCAL BRAIN DAMAGE To understand the sentence ""Who did the girl the teacher forced to talk complain to?""  One must determine that ""the girl"" is to be taken as the missing subject of the verb ""talk"" and that ""who"" is the missing object of the preposition ""to.""  Sentences with such long-distance dependencies as that between ""the girl"" and the subject position preceding ""to talk"" pose special problems for theories of sentence comprehension.  They challenge the apparent human limits on short-term memory and processing capacity, in that arbitrary amounts of linguistic material can intervene between the items that are dependent upon each other and any one sentence can contain several long-distance dependencies.  Further, they are subject to unique linguistic constraints that a language user must honor.  We propose experiments to study the comprehension of sentences with long-distance dependencies, using reaction time and other measures of processing difficulty. Our goals are to determine what decision principles people follow in understanding such sentences, to identify the various types of information (lexical, pragmatic, suprasegmental, grammatical constraints) they use in making decisions about long-distance dependencies, and to specify the sequence in which they use functionally different types of information.

The cloning vehicle contains the lacZ gene positioned to allow quantitation of initiation from each binding site and the f1 origin which allows rapid DNA sequencing.  From a large set of sequences for which we know the relative efficiencies of initiation we can build linear models of the E. coli ribosome binding site.  We will construct plasmids with regions that differ on the 5' and 3' sides from our original plasmid in order to study the more complex effects of mRNA structure and context on translational initiation.  We propose to extend this technique into a tool for the study of any binding site.  We are also studying sequence specific recognition of DNA by proteins.  We have adapted the Shannon measure of information to quantitate the information content of several recognition systems.  This has led to a prediction that the T7 late promoters have overlapping repressor sites, a prediction that we are now testing.  We have shown that the information content of sites for recognizer proteins is related to the sequence specific binding energies, and have devised a method to determine the quantitative sequence preferences of proteins through in vitro binding to random DNA.

"CONTEXT-BASED AUTOMATED DETECTION OF ABNORMAL EEG WAVES The proposed research will investigate the development of an ""intelligent"", multichannel (16 channels) automated (general purpose computer-based) system for the reliable detection of epileptogenic sharp waveforms (spikes and shart waves-STs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG).  The system will provide the time of occurrence of individual STs, their spatial location, along with values of pertinent electrographic characteristics (e.g. amplitude, duration) thereof.  Special attention will be given to the minimization of false alarms due to artifact and normal EEG activity.  Such a system will especially facilitate the rapid and reliable analysis of long-term EEG recordings from subjects with known or suspected epilepsy, thus contributing to their optimum therapeutic management as well as resulting in savings of time and money.  Extensive heuristics based on human pattern recognition, which involves contextbased analysis, will be utilized.  In this way, the system will incorporate the intelligence of an electroencephalographer (EEGer).  An Artificial Intelligence approach will be implemented, whereby EEG features quantifying candidate waveforms, as well as automated assessment of the subject's state of consciousness will be presented to an Expert System for eventual decision making.  The knowledge base of the Expert system will be developed in close cooperation with an experienced EEGer, so that the extensive contextbased heuristics utilized in the visual analysis process (e.g. spatio-temporal processing involving multichannel correlations) will be implemented.  Special emphasis will be given to programming into the detection system the ability to discriminate against ST-like artifactual activity in the EEG record (e.g. electrocardiographic and electromyographic interference) as well as against sharp but normal EEG activity (e.g. sleep spindles).  Extensive validation studies will be conducted utilizing EEG data from epileptic subjects, other patients, and normal controls.  An investigation will also take place of the possibility of implementing the detection system in a microprocessor-based version for portability and ease of operation.

"COMPUTER-ASSISTED STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION The characterization of the structure of a biomolecule on the its  chemical and spectral properties is of widespread importance in the biomedical sciences.  Because of its complexity, structure characterization is overall a time-consuming activity that has been largely left to experts in the field.  The goal of this research is to substantially increase the productivity of those experts.  Given the expert's proficiency in readily picking out the correct structure of an unknown from among a limited number of alternative structures, a much more expeditious assignment of structure would be achieved if the expert could begin the structure characterization problem with such a conceptually manageable number of plausible alternatives.  Thus, the goal of the research is to create artificial intelligence based computer software capable of directly reducing the collective spectral properties (infrared, proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet and mass spectral data) of the unknown to a conceptually manageable number of stereochemically defined structures, each of which is compatible with the observed spectral data.  The expert is still a required player, but is spared what is actually the time-intensive component of the ""manual"" process, that of producing the limited number of alternatives.  Key features of the software to be created include, (1) programs for both spectrum interpretation and structure generation, (2) provision to accept any structural information known to the expert and (3) the capability to treat real-world structure characterization problems without regard to the class of structures to which the unknown belongs.  The last named feature requires a system that is not spectral library dependent.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION FOR ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCES We propose to continue (A) the development of mathematical, statistical and computer methods for the analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences and (B) the application of these methods.  The comparison of two and more informational sequences is central to many problems in molecular biology. (1) Finding consenting patterns that define genetic control regions or that determine structure or function are important examples of sequence comparisons.  An algorithm already developed by my group will be developed further and applied to several new data sets, such as Pol II promoters and RNA splice signals.  Careful data analyses should suggest new modifications to the method.  New and nontrivial insights into promoter patterns, for example, could result from an unbiased, rigorous analysis with calculated significance levels.  (2) Secondary structure of 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA has been inferred by the phylogenetic method.  Consensus and probability results will be developed to solve this problem in a rigorous way.  Again, new information about secondary structure could result.  (3) T1 catalogs are available for 16S rRNA from many organisms.  A careful analysis, based on pattern and significance of found patterns, will be made.  This will constitute a new and entirely unbiased study of divisions such as archaebacteria, eukaryotes, and eubacteria.  (4) Recent important results have been established for the exact (extreme value) distribution of long exact matches between random sequences.  These distributions are fundamental to pattern recognition in general and allow statistical assessment of found patterns.  The distributions will be extended to include results of long matching where mismatches and insertion/deletions are allowed.

"IMAGE ANALYSIS OF STAINED AND UNSTAINED MACROMOLECULES The structures of polyoma virus and its polymorphic aggregates, SV40 virus, myosin subfragment-1, and the chloroplast cytochrome b6/f complex will be studied by electron microscopy and image analysis methods.  These studies are aimed at answering questions about the overall structure, assembly, stability, and function of these macromolecular aggregates.  We will learn about protein-protein interactions in polyoma, SV40, myosin subfragment-1, and cytochrome b6/f, protein-nucleic acid associations in polyoma and SV40, and protein-lipid associations in cytochrome b6/f.  The biological significance of each of these systems is well documented. Polyoma and SV40 do not cause malignancies in their natural hosts (mice and rhesus monkeys), but their oncogenic potential is revealed when high concentrations of virus are injected into either foreign hosts or natural hosts lacking a functional immunological system.  Subfragment-1, the head portion of myosin, is responsible for force generation in muscle through the hydrolysis of ATP and interaction with actin.  Cytochrome b6/f, an integral membrane-spanning complex in chloroplast thylakoids, is involved in photosynthetic and respiratory energy transduction.  The potential to study these and similar structures requires continued efforts to develop and implement new techniques of electron microscopy and image analysis as well as the application of established procedures. Microscopy of frozen-hydrated specimens will help reveal the ""native"" structure of biological molecules, and implementation of highly interactive, computer graphics image analysis routines will allow flexible and efficient processing of micrographs from a greater variety of biological systems of increased complexity.

"ROLE OF Z BAND IN CARDIAC SARCOMERE In heart muscle cells, the contractile units must be linked by Z bands for effective contraction.  The Z band is a complex protein lattice which is an integral part of the contractile apparatus, but its exact role in contraction is not known.  Z bands vary in width in normal and diseased muscles, but the functional significance of this variation remains obscure.  Using optical diffraction methods, we have identified a common structural unit in Z bands of mammalian cardiac and slow skeletal muscle.  Our optical reconstruction studies show a regular arrangement of axial and cross connecting filaments.  However, the Z band is rarely a uniform lattice, because there is variation in the arrangement of cross connecting filaments.  Two different lattice forms, basket weave and small square are observed and suggest that the Z band is a dynamic structure capable of responding to different physiological states of the muscle.  Our purpose in these studies is to examine structural differences in the Z band lattice between cardiac and slow skeletal muscle, between slow and fast skeletal muscle, between adult and developing muscle, between normal and diseased muscle and to correlate them with specific structural states induced experimentally.  We will generate a three dimensional reconstruction of the Z band by computerized image processing of a tilt series of electron micrographs.  Then we can determine the impact of specific rearrangements within the lattice in different muscle types in different physiological states.  Using goniometer tilt and stereo techniques at standard and high voltages, together with optical diffraction and reconstruction methods, we will examine Z bands 1) in normal muscles fixed or frozen before, during, and after tetanic contraction; 2) in normal muscle partially extracted and reconstituted; 3) in isolated myofibrils; and 4) in postnatally developing intact muscle.  A systematic analysis will be used to answer two questions.  Why does the lattice move?  How is the Z band formed?  The emphasis will be on the three dimensional structure of the Z band lattice.  New information about Z bands structure will help us to understand the significance of widened Z bands in developing muscle and in diseased muscle and may suggest a mechanism for the formation and breakdown of the Z bands.

"RECONSTRUCTION AND DISPLAY IN TOMOGRAPHIC RADIOLOGY This is a renewal application for a grant currently entitled ""Computer Technology for Transaxial Tomography"".  The change in title to ""Reconstruction and Display in Tomographic Radiology"" reflects a shift in the nature of the proposed work.  We propose to cover various modalities in radiology--namely, computerized tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US)--all of which are tomographic in the sense that they produce images of slices through the human body.  ""Reconstruction"" in the title of the proposal is to be interpreted as the procedure to produce such images from the measured raw data in CT, PET, and MRI.  ""Display"" in the title is to be interpreted as the procedure to put together in three-dimensional (3D)--or (including time) 4D--space the information that exists in the individual slices.  In ""reconstruction"" we plan to concentrate on finite series expansion methods, methods derived from a semi-continuous formulation, preprocessing of incomplete or distorted data, with applications to CT, PET, and MRI.  In ""display"" we plan to concentrate on segmentation (identification of structures of interest, such as specific organs and tumors, in the 3D space) and on rapid display, analysis, and manipulation of the identified structures, with applications to measurement of volumetric changes in soft-tissue masses, surgical planning, radiation therapy treatment planning, and characterization of the normal, ischemic and scarred myocardium.

"SLIT-SCAN LIGHT SCATTER The major goal of this grant is the understanding of slit-scan light scatter signals and the information they provide.  This will be accomplished through the following tasks:  (1) The completion of the addition of low angle forward and large angle light scatter sensors to two multidimensional slit-scan flow systems.  (2) The reassembly of a Correlation System to provide two orthogonal fluorescence images of cells in flow together with fluorescence and light scatter slit-scan contours.  (3) The collection and correlation of slit-scan light scatter and fluorescence contours. Because the two contours are perfectly correlated, this will permit identification in the slit-scan light scatter contour of the exact point at which the cytoplasm and nuclear boundaries of the cell intersect the slit of laser illumination.  Specific cell types will be analyzed to aid in the understanding of the information available from the slit-scan light scatter contours.  Of particular interest are nuclear and cell boundaries together with information on intracellular structure.  (4) The investigation of detector geometry to optimize morphological boundary, clump, internal structure, and orientation information from slit-scan light scatter contours on cells in flow.  (5) The collection and correlation of slit-scan light scatter contours with slit-scan fluorescence contours and two orthogonal fluorescence images of cells in flow. This data will aid in the study and understanding of the effects of cell orientation in flow on slit-scan light scatter signals and the use of slit-scan light scatter signals to provide information on cell orientation in flow, internal structure, multinucleation, and clumping of cells, and the identification of low resolution morphological features.  (6) Increasing the resolution on one system to two microns to permit the study and understanding of slit-scan light scatter information on other cell types of interest. (7) Parallel theoretical studies and guidance to aid in hardware design, study direction, and the understanding of slit-scan light scatter information.
