"COLLAGEN POLYMORPHISM IN NORMAL AND CIRRHOTIC LIVER In the two years of the granting period we have completed the localization by light and electron microscopy of four components of the hepatic extracellular matrix in normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  Collagen deposition in our system is a late event in the cirrhotic process, the earliest detectable change, is increased synthesis of fibronectin by the hepatocyte with subsequent deposition of this fibronectin in the space of Disse.  Our working hypothesis is that not only does fibronectin play a critical role in the fibrotic process, but that this role may be mediated by post-translational modifications in the fibronectin secreted by the injured hepatocyte.  We are proposing to complete the morphological studies initiated two years ago, obtaining precise quantitation (with computer-aided image analysis) of the changes in the hepatic extracellular matrix in the normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  New studies include:  The reversal of the cirrhosis induced by CCl4 and characterization and quantitation of the catabolism of this extracellular matrix during the reversal of the cirrhosis.  These studies will use light and electron immunohistochemistry combined with image analysis.  To characterize and quantitate the matrix produced by primary cultures of hepatocytes obtained from normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic livers using immunohistochemistry, quantitative rocket immunoelectrophoresis and electroimmunobloting.  We will use in vitro sublethal hepatocyte injury with CCl4 and compare the matrix secreted in vitro by these injured hepatocytes with that secreted by normal hepatocytes.  The last part of the proposal will initiate studies designed to characterize any possible changes in the fibronectin secreted by hepatocytes as a response to injury.  Plasma and tissue fibronectin from rats exposed to CCl4 will be compared with plasma and tissue fibronectin from normal rats.  The fibronectins will be characterized by PAGE, IEF, electroimmunoblotting and crossed immunoaffinity electrophoresis with ConA in the first dimension.  Using this combination of techniques it should be possible to detect any post-translational modifications in the fibronectin secreted by rat hepatocytes in response to chronic injury.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED BIOLOGICAL MODELING INFORMATION SYSTEM The Committee on Models for Biomedical Research has proposed a ""matrix of biological knowledge"" (Matrix) to address the need for a means to organize and intelligently access the wealth of information that confronts biomedical researchers (c.f. Models for Biomedical Research, National Academy Press, 1985).  To implement the matrix will require a fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and database technologies as well as an understanding of the structure of biological knowledge.  However, a full implementation of the Matrix is best not attempted until pilot studies on a restricted domain of knowledge have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of the concept.  One domain of considerable general interest is that of nucleic acid and protein sequence libraries, which have become invaluable research tools for a large segment of the biomedical research community. In addition to the libraries themselves a large number of computer programs have been written to analyze the sequence data, which has resulted in major new discoveries.  The utility of these libraries to the typical laboratory investigator could be greatly enhanced by augmenting them with the types of knowledge management and reasoning systems envisioned for the Matrix. The goal of this proposed work is to build a testbed for the Matrix concept on top of the existing sequence libraries, benefitting both the larger goals of the Matrix and the immediate needs of sequence library users.  Steps in this process will include: (1) implementation of the GenBank database in a relational form, interfaced to an AI environment; (2) creation of a series of knowledge bases relating to the database, starting with simple taxonomies and progression to more complex representations (on narrower test domains); (3) creation of a set of user interfaces oriented to the needs of molecular biologist; and (4) investigation of various techniques of inference against the knowledge base, in particular reasoning by analogy, with the ultimate aim of allowing users to build and test hypotheses locally.

"INVESTIGATION OF PROBLEM-SOLVING & MAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS We propose a five year program of investigation into problem- solving in immunohematology, leading to the development of a knowledge-based decision support system and a prototype intelligent tutoring system.  Initially, the techniques and methodologies of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence will be used in tandem to investigate the problem-solving of practitioners in immunohematology at various levels of expertise.  During this period the knowledge and problem-solving used by individuals performing various interpretation tasks in immunohematology will be described from an information processing perspective.  This description will be performed within the context of the generic task theory of problem-solving, which has proven successful in constructing expert systems in a variety of medical fields.  In order to more fully understand the performance of immunohematologists, both correct/expert performance and error-producing behavior will be modeled.  The resultant models will then be used as the basis for developing knowledge-based systems to support the education and practice of immunohematology.
