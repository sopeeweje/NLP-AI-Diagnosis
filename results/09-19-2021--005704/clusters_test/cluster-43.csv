"Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses The natural immune response to foreign pathogens involves a complex coordination of cells, including an adaptive response to select and secrete antibodies into circulation. Individuals who have recovered from a pathogenic infection retain immune memory and continue to circulate pathogen-specific antibodies. For many infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola, and poxviruses, antibodies with neutralizing activity to multiple viral strains have been discovered from human survivors. The discovered antibodies are highly valuable as potential biologic therapeutics for the broader population, as the antibodies have been naturally optimized to defend against human pathogens.  Efforts to discover antibodies from humans recovering from coronavirus infection are underway, SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but are hampered by the limitations of existing antibody discovery platforms. Current approaches require screening for live B cells actively producing pathogen-specific antibodies, which are sensitive to cell death and rarely found in blood. In contrast, antibody protein is stable and pathogen-reactive antibodies are abundant in serum. While protein is the ideal material to start with, characterization of polyclonal antibody (pAb) protein presents new challenges.  Recent advances in mass spectrometry and analysis have shown individual antibody candidates can be derived from affinity-purified pAb proteins when a sufficiently matched B-cell genetic antibody repertoire is provided. We aim to develop algorithms to supplant the need of a genetic antibody repertoire, and de novo identify antibody candidates from limited complexity pAb samples. This is achieved by improvements to de novo peptide sequencing using machine learning, and targeted assembly of specificity determining regions (CDR3s) and antibody frameworks using de Bruijn graphs. The proposed software will provide estimates of clonal diversity and candidate sequences that can be synthesized and tested for reactivity. In addition to addressing needs for infectious diseases, as demonstrated with an urgent unmet need to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the software also applies to clinical and biomedical research needs in autoimmune disease, and commercial interests in replacing polyclonal antibody reagents with highly reproducible monoclonal antibody equivalents. The antibody repertoire circulating in serum is the most active component to an immune response, yet is unable to be directly queried without aid from the genetic antibody repertoire from cells. Our innovative algorithms enable querying and sequencing of antibodies directly from protein - opening the door to previously inaccessible autoimmune and infectious disease research and therapeutic antibody discovery.",Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses,10140073,R44GM140607,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Circulation', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coronavirus', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Ebola', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Oncology', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Poxviridae', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Salvelinus', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Transcript', 'Vaccine Design', 'Viral', 'adaptive immune response', 'analytical method', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'polyclonal antibody', 'proteogenomics', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"DIGITAL PROTEOMICS, LLC",R44,2021,802944
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,10093062,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,393339
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,10168567,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'algorithm development', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,321398
"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation. We propose to develop technologies to meet this need. Present proteomics methods quantify proteins using a few representative peptides per gene product; sequence coverage for most proteins is low. Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context. We propose to develop technologies to compare glycoprotein similarities among biological sample sets. To do this, we will develop MS acquisition and bioinformatics methods for rapid, sensitive and reproducible mapping of glycoprotein glycosylation to enable statistically rigorous comparison of glycoprotein similarities. By making these technologies available, we will enable a new level of understanding of the roles of matrisome networks in human diseases. Project narrative The matrisome consists of glycosylated extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins that surround cells and support normal physiological activity. While it is known that glycosylation changes during disease processes, it has not been possible to quantitatively compare glycoprotein structure among biological samples.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance.

"Structural Mechanisms of Cytoskeletal Force-Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY  Cells in the body perceive cues from their local environment, which control cellular behavior through a coordinated series of molecular events known as signaling. Signaling is critically important for telling a cell if it should grow and divide, migrate to a different part of the body, or commit suicide if it has completed its function or been irreparably damaged. Frequently, signaling processes are found to be working incorrectly in diseased cells. For instance, cancer cells divide and migrate out of control and ignore cues which should keep them in check. Signals come in multiple forms. Specific molecules bind and activate cognate receptor proteins in the cell, known as “chemical signaling”, which is broadly well-understood. Physical forces and the rigidity of a cell’s environment also elicit specific cell behaviors, but we have a comparatively poor understanding of how proteins transmit these “mechanical signals”. A significant fraction of successful drugs target protein molecules which operate in chemical signaling. The development of many such treatments was stimulated by determining the detailed three-dimensional chemical structures of the interactions between receptor proteins and the molecules which activate them, facilitating the design of drugs which precisely intervene in these processes. Despite its importance, efforts to therapeutically target mechanical signaling have been limited. The long-term goal of this research project is to visualize how forces modulate the three-dimensional structure of mechanical signaling proteins to activate them, in order to facilitate the development of drugs that block these changes.  This proposal is specifically focused on understanding how cellular polymers (“filaments”) composed of the protein actin coordinate mechanical signaling. The cell contains many networks composed of actin filaments, myosin molecular motor proteins, and hundreds of other binding partners, which collectively generate and transmit diverse forces. We hypothesize that specific types of forces cause distinct physical rearrangements in actin filaments, which can be detected by other proteins in the cell through direct binding interactions. We will identify proteins which bind actin in a force-sensitive manner (Aim 1), focusing specifically on delineating the precise regions of the proteins which confer force-sensitivity. We will next visualize how side-wise bending forces (Aim 2) and length-wise tensile and compressive forces generated by myosin motor proteins (Aim 3) impact actin filament structure, hypothesizing these force regimes produce distinct rearrangements which can be discriminated by binding partners. In pursuit of these Aims, we are developing sample preparation and computational image analysis approaches to visualize the three-dimensional structure of actin polymers in the presence of mechanical forces with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In addition to providing basic insights into how forces are perceived by cells through changes in protein structure, our studies will guide the development of precise molecular interventions into mechanical signaling processes governed by actin. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Mechanical signaling is critical in development and immune function, and its dysfunction has been implicated in numerous malignancies, including cancer and cardiomyopathies. This project aims to reveal how forces alter the structure of actin filaments, the major load-bearing element of the cell.

"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10259801,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,399375
"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals.

"Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins Project Summary Proteins function through interactions with other proteins and biological entities to form biological pathways inside and between cells. Targeted therapies are designed to mitigate or reverse malfunctions caused by mutations in proteins via providing drugs to recover normal biological pathways’ activities. Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways is a powerful way to infer potential functions of these proteins. Pathway-based approaches are now routinely applied in bioinformatics and computational biology data analysis and visualization. Pathway databases are essential for those approaches. During the past two decades, our team has been working together on building the Reactome knowledgebase, arguably the most popular and comprehensive open source biological pathway database, covering over half of human protein-coding genes and widely used in the research community. In this application, we propose to develop a Reactome IDG pathway portal, which will allow localization of understudied proteins in biological pathways, identifying likely interactions with better-known proteins in specific processes annotated in Reactome, pinpointing most effective drug targets via pathway modeling, thus generating testable predictions of molecular functions of these proteins in key domains of biology. Specially we will develop a web-based application to place understudied proteins in the context of Reactome pathways by importing a variety of data types collected in the IDG projects and other resources and then overlaying them onto the Reactome pathways by leveraging existing Reactome software tools (e.g. interaction overlay). Furthermore, we will develop a machine learning approach to predict functional interactions between understudied proteins and well-known Reactome annotated proteins and a Boolean network-based fuzzy logic modeling approach to integrate the scores produced from the machine learning approach to simulate the impacts of understudied proteins on pathways’ activities. We believe our approach will provide a unique and powerful approach to help the community to understand the contribution of the understudied proteins to cellular functions. Project Narrative Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways provides a framework to understand potential functions of these proteins. Reactome is the most comprehensive open source biological pathway knowledgebase. We propose to develop a Reactome IDG portal for understudied proteins, assisting researchers to infer biological functions of understudied proteins.",Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins,10348828,U01CA239069,"['Animal Model', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Genes', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Infectious Agent', 'Level of Evidence', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Technology', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'data visualization', 'knowledge base', 'open source', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'web app']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,400015
"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.
