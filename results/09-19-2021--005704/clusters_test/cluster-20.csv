"Improved Surgical Navigation Using Video-CT Registration Abstract  In many surgical procedures, image guided surgery (IGS), also known as surgical navigation, facilitates precise surgical manipulations near critical structures such as the brain and eye. IGS suffers from critical limitations such as loss of precision and correspondence with preoperative imaging once surgery begins and the anatomy is altered. These limitations may be addressed through intra-operative imaging, which effectively “resets” the model and thus enables both improved precision of IGS as well as improved surgical decision- making. However, intraoperative radiologic imaging has many limitations, including disruption of the workflow, cost, and additional radiation exposure. This project aims to develop solutions to resolve limitations of IGS without the need for intra-operative radiologic imaging. Our solutions rely upon data from a device that is present in every procedure using IGS, namely, the endoscope. Our goal in this project is use endoscopic video images to reconstruct surgical anatomy as it changes. This enables sustained precision in registration with pre- operative imaging throughout the procedure by updating the anatomical model as surgery progresses. We will achieve this by 1) using advances in computer vision to develop improved methods for continuous direct registration between the endoscope and the CT; and 2) developing methods that continuously compute the geometry of observed surfaces and update the preoperative CT with changes in that geometry. The technology developed in this proposal thus enables the following: 1) precise surgical navigation using the endoscope throughout the procedure; 2) surgical decision-making without the need for additional intra-operative imaging; and 3) new tools to reconstruct surgical anatomy and quantitatively evaluate the extent of surgery. Narrative  Image guided surgery is widely used to safely navigate around complex structures like the ethmoid bone and critical structures such as the brain; its utility is greatly enhanced when coupled with intraoperative radiographic imaging because the anatomic changes caused by surgery are clearly elucidated and can be incorporated into the surgical plan. This project will develop computational methods that exploit readily available endoscopic video to improve the accuracy of navigation and to provide intraoperative updates to the anatomic model. This technology will enhance surgical decisions in the operating room and enable precise navigation throughout the surgery without the need for additional radiologic imaging in the operating room.",Improved Surgical Navigation Using Video-CT Registration,10099301,R01EB030511,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cadaver', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Documentation', 'Endoscopes', 'Ethmoid bone structure', 'Eye', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Investigation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Radiation exposure', 'Safety', 'Sinus', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Touch sensation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'operation', 'radiological imaging', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,628311
"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer",10177883,U01CA225431,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cetuximab', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunotherapy', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'drug discovery', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genomic signature', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'mutant', 'mutational status', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2021,609495
"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure.

"Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabeled tracer 2- deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard imaging tool for cancer patient management. The semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) is routinely used in clinical for tumor uptake quantification, which is computed on the static PET image acquired at a certain time (typically 60 min) post tracer injection for a short interval (typically 5-15 min). However, the quantification accuracy of SUV from a single PET scan suffers from the variabilities of tracer plasma clearance and acquisition start time. The dual- time-point FDG PET imaging has been intensively investigated and used in both clinical and research studies, typically one scan at 60 min and the other at 120 min, showing the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET by differentiating malignancy from inflammation and normal tissue. However, the current clinical dual-time-point FDG PET studies use the relative SUV change between two scans as the quantification index, which cannot eliminate the variations in tracer plasma clearance. Meanwhile, the dual-time-point protocol has not been optimized and standardized currently, leading to conflicting results. The fully-quantitative parameter, tracer net uptake rate constant Ki, is the most accurate parameter to quantify FDG PET, which is calculated using dynamic imaging with compartmental modeling. Ki is independent on the plasma clearance or acquisition start time. However, the long and complex acquisition protocol (typically at least 60 min), which requires dynamic scanning and sequential arterial blood sampling (or image-derived blood activity) used as input function from the time of injection, limits its application in clinical practice. Meanwhile, generation of the parametric Ki image, which can provide additional heterogeneity information for FDG PET, is challenging clinically using voxel-by-voxel compartmental modeling due to the computational cost and being sensitive to noise using non-linear least squares. The graphical Patlak plot, can be used for simplified Ki calculation and Ki image generation by voxel-by-voxel fitting. However, it still needs dynamic scanning starting from 15-30 min after injection and input function from the time of injection. The aims of this proposal are 1) to optimize the dual-time-point protocol for accurate Ki quantification using Patlak plot without the need for individual patient's input function, and 2) to generate high-quality low-noise dual-time-point Ki images using novel techniques based on deep learning. Upon the success of this project, our proposed approach can obtain reliable tumor Ki quantification and parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual- time-point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology. We expect the translation of this approach to clinical investigation to be fast, as this is a post-processing approach and is based on data already acquired using clinically used protocol without imposing additional burden to technologists. Project Narrative For FDG PET imaging, we propose to develop a novel and simple approach of quantifying tumor Ki and generating parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual-time- point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology.",Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans,10117077,R03EB027864,"['Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiolabeled', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'population based', 'research study', 'simulation', 'success', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,83750
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10187567,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2021,310796
"Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning The accuracy of radiation treatment planning (RTP) heavily influences the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of target and OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and automated multi-organ segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will develop an MT-MR simulation based multi-organ auto- segmentation tool. In Aim 3, we will optimize a deep learning-based dose prediction model and assess the effectiveness of the MT-MR based RTP workflow in adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy planning of pancreatic cancer patients. Successful completion of the project will significantly promote the clinical adoption of MR simulation for abdominal RTP, which will improve treatment precision and outcomes. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in both cancer diagnosis and radiotherapy. Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile. We will substantially improve the MR acquisition and automated multi- organ segmentation, so the potential of MR as an imaging-based planning modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal radiation treatment.",Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning,10331615,R01EB029088,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Study Subject', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Water', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pancreatic cancer patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,507076
"Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors Project Summary Background: In-depth study of neoantigens will promote our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of basic immunology and immune-related disease processes, such as response to cancer immunotherapy. Neoantigens play a key role in the recognition of tumor cells by T cells and are increasingly shown to be targets of checkpoint inhibitor-induced immune response. However, several missing links exist in neoantigen research. (1) Only a small proportion of neoantigens can elicit T cell responses. It is even less clear which neoantigens will be recognized by which specific T cell receptor (TCR). (2) Although neoantigens are important during the course of action of immunotherapies, how neoantigen repertoire data can be used to predict patient response is only poorly understood. (3) The lack of standardized analysis pipelines and limited sharing of neoantigen data have hindered efficient and consistent research in the tumor immunogenomics field. Aim 1: Build a transfer learning-based model to predict immunogenicity of neoantigens. So far, only a very limited number of reports have created predictive models determining whether a neoantigen/MHC complex can elicit any T cell response. Even fewer of them are capable of predicting the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens. However, the capability to predict the overall immunogenicity and the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens is critical for improving the benefit of immunotherapy. Aim 1 addresses this challenge with advanced transfer learning algorithms, followed by benchmarking and laboratory validations. Aim 2: Predict response to checkpoint inhibitors by integration of the immunogenicity and other properties of all neoantigens in a patient, through a Bayesian multi-instance learning model. To date, most studies have focused on the neoantigen/mutation load approach in correlation with response of patients to immunotherapy administration. This simplistic approach misses the rich information contained in the whole repertoire of neoantigens per patient and has been successful in only a few studies, but not others. Aim 2 addresses this important inadequacy by creating a Bayesian multi-instance learning model that fully considers various quality features, including immunogenicity, of all neoantigens in a patient for prediction of treatment response. Aim 3: Create a web portal to provide neoantigen-related computational services and to share neoantigen data. The PI will establish a public webserver providing cloud-based standardized services, including prediction of neoantigens and the advanced analysis methods developed in Aim 1 and 2. The webserver will openly share neoantigen/TCR and patient phenotype data, in accordance with IRB and HIPAA regulations. Expected impact: (1) This project will predict the immunogenicity of neoantigens, which could inform neoantigen vaccine development. (2) This project will predict response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on patient neoantigen profiles. (3) The neoantigen database will propel research and also lead to clinical applications for cancers and other immune-related diseases, such as COVID-19. Project Narrative We will develop deep learning-based models to predict the TCR binding specificity of neoantigens/MHC complexes (immunogenicity). We will predict patient response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on immunogenicity and other properties of neoantigens. We will build a comprehensive neoantigen webserver, which will facilitate a coordinated effort to accelerate tumor immunogenomics research and clinical applications for personalized medicine.",Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors,10180781,R01CA258584,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'COVID-19', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MHC antigen', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'data sharing networks', 'deep learning', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'statistics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vaccine development', 'web portal']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,378897
"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world.

"Defining cellular states of quiescence in human brain tumors PROJECT SUMMARY The most aggressive type of brain tumor, grade IV glioma known as glioblastoma (GBM), is one of the few tumor types with both a poor outcome and minimal improvement in survival in the past decades. For GBM, like other solid cancers, intratumoral heterogeneity is likely an important factor in mediating therapeutic response. In particular, quiescent, G0-like subpopulations may engender tumors with more robust responses to treatment regimens and allow for tumor regrowth after standard of care (SOC). However, G0-like tumor populations are currently ill-defined, even after application of single cell genomics to GBM. Our failure to fully comprehend and experimentally model quiescent/G0-like states represents a critical knowledge gap, but also a key opportunity, for glioma and other cancers, as neutralizing G0 cells could effectively prevent chemoradiotherapy resistance and tumor recurrence. The purpose of this grant is to provide a functional and molecular definition of G0-like states in GBM tumors and their responses to SOC. In Aim 1, we will define molecular networks governing long- and short-term quiescent states in GBM patient tumors using a novel G0 reporter system in combination with single cell genomic analysis. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that dormant G0 GBM cells have unique RNA and chromatin signatures required for SOC survival and tumor regrowth. In Aim 3, we will study and nominate the NuA4/KAT5 lysine acetyltransferase complex as a key regulator of G0-like states in GBM and candidate therapeutic target. The Aims are built on strong preliminary data, including: the creation of a machine learning-based method for identifying G0-like cells in gliomas, integrated analysis of single cell RNA and chromatin analysis of primary and PDX GBM tumors with standard of care, a functional genomic screen to identify regulators of GBM G0, and key experimental models to functionally dissect G0 states in GBM tumor models. If successful, this grant will produce a new working model for GBM G0-like states, provide key genes and gene networks associated with G0, and analysis tools for identifying G0-like states in clinical samples. It will also define how these populations respond to SOC and shift tumor dynamics during recurrence. Finally, it will provide data for a new therapeutic strategy, ""downgrading"", where grade IV tumors are made less aggressive by triggering extended or permanent G0-like states in tumor cells. NARRATIVE Solid tumor recurrence is likely driven by slow dividing or quiescent tumor subpopulations in the primary tumor which survive treatment regimens and give rise to secondary tumors. However, we currently lack a basic understanding of molecular features of these populations and, as a result, do not have effective therapeutic strategies to neutralize them. The experiments described in this proposal are directly relevant to public health because they will identify and dissect molecular vulnerabilities that can eliminate tumor subpopulations resistant to conventional therapies.",Defining cellular states of quiescence in human brain tumors,10101272,R01NS119650,"['Acetyltransferase', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adopted', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cancer Model', 'Caring', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Experimental Models', 'Failure', 'G0 Phase', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Grant', 'HTATIP gene', 'Human', 'Indolent', 'Knowledge', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'conventional therapy', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'neoplasm resource', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurogenesis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'prevent', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'standard of care', 'stem-like cell', 'temozolomide', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'therapeutically effective', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,553130
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10220967,R44EB024438,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Location', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'radiation effect', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'voltage']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2021,821583
"A System for Xerostomia Risk Classification after Head & Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Summary Radiotherapy (RT) is a major component in the treatment of most head and neck cancer (HNC) cases. During irradiation, sensitive regions such as the salivary glands can sustain injury, resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth). This side effect is common and can significantly reduce quality of life during and post-treatment. The focus of this application is prediction during treatment planning of whether patients will suffer high-grade xerostomia (NCI CTCAE Grade 2-3) at the time of their first post-treatment follow-up visit, typically 3-6 months after RT (prevalence is approximately 40%). Predictions will enable clinicians to carry out treatment planning with improved knowledge of the likelihood of high-grade xerostomia development and allow better-informed and more timely anticipation of consequences such as eating difficulty. In this Phase 1 project, Oncospace Inc. will develop a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) prediction model using over 1200 complete HNC patient records. Associations between high-grade xerostomia and a wide range of dosimetric, clinical and demographic features will be automatically discovered and the features with the strongest associations will populate the nodes of a decision tree. The terminal leaf nodes will each contain the probability of high-grade xerostomia for the subset of patients in that node. In addition, leaf nodes will be assigned binary class labels designating a high- or low risk of high-grade xerostomia. This type of model provides transparency and interpretability, which are beneficial for clinical acceptance and for demonstration of safety to regulatory agencies. The software will be built using the Microsoft Azure cloud architecture and be deployed via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. There are three distinct aims of this project:  1. Populate Oncospace Inc.’s Microsoft Azure CosmosDB database with data licensed from Johns Hopkins  University, including steps such as patient de-identification, data curation, and additional dataset feature engineering  2. Perform CART modeling and test model accuracy, using separate training and test datasets and a variety  of performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and F1-score.  3. Design a clinically acceptable risk classification strategy and a user interface (UI) to communicate model  results. Expert input from a team of UI consultants and three radiation oncologists will be an integral part  of the development, testing, and evaluation processes. The successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the clinical and commercial feasibility of a xerostomia prediction model for HNC. Further development in Phase 2 will include deeper model personalization via incorporation of advanced image features (radiomics), as well as validation of model generalizability and commercial viability via the curation and use in model building of data from other institutions. Oncospace, formed in 2018, is uniquely positioned to carry out this work as the team includes the creators of the Pinnacle radiation therapy planning system, Tomotherapy radiation treatment delivery system, and HealthMyne Quantitative Imaging Decision Support platform. Oncospace has close clinical collaboration with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for clinical feedback, validation and initial deployment. Oncospace has licensed three patents and subscription to complete patient treatment records for over 6,000 radiation oncology patients from JHU. The company has won the Microsoft Innovation Acceleration Award for its innovative platform to deliver AI-enabled healthcare solutions to the radiation oncology community. Page 1 of 1 Narrative During standard-of-care radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, the salivary glands often sustain radiation- induced injury leading to xerostomia (dry mouth). Machine learning-based predictions can be used to help create treatment plans that minimize the chance of severe xerostomia, and to better anticipate and manage its occurrence.

"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,10065497,R01CA218357,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Incineration', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Kansas', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effective treatment', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacious treatment', 'efficacy outcomes', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung preservation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'minimal risk', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pre-clinical', 'pulmonary function', 'real time monitoring', 'safety and feasibility', 'simulation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor ablation', 'virtual']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,236163
"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,10158473,R21EB029179,"['Abdomen', 'Academia', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fruit', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'mortality', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'targeted imaging', 'urolithiasis']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2021,227282
"Integrative molecular dissection of acquired resistance to PD1/PD-L1 blockade in localized and metastatic urothelial carcinoma Project Summary/Abstract Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) is generally incurable with modest survival benefit provided by first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy and post-platinum PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy. Optimal therapy for progressive mUC following PD1/L1 inhibitors is necessary with new agents for this setting (enfortumab vedotin, erdafitinib) providing modest incremental benefits coupled with toxicities. Limited data exist for analysis of tumor acquired after PD1/L1 inhibitor systemic therapy, which is necessary to determine causes of both response and resistance. Indeed, multiplatform analyses of post-PD1/L1 inhibitor UC tumor have not been reported. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that tumor, immune and stromal microenvironmental factors determine resistance to PD-1/L1 therapy mUC, and that integrated bulk and single cell molecular dissection of post-treatment tumors will reveal these features. We propose innovative and potentially transformative multiplatform longitudinally obtained bulk and/or single cell (sc) analysis of pre and post PD1/L1 inhibitor tumor tissue and plasma from muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and mUC to shed deep insights regarding tumor biology and resistance and information that can be used to develop new therapies. We will perform detailed multiplatform analyses on 2 separate cohorts totaling 170 patients: 1) tumor tissue obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor exposure or untreated controls (n=130) and 2) plasma cell-free (cf)-DNA obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor exposure or untreated controls (n=40). Whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA-Seq and orthogonal multiparametric IHC for immune markers is performed of baseline transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens and post-therapy tumors. Patients included are from trials that evaluated a PD1/L1 inhibitor (n=70) as neoadjuvant therapy preceding RC for MIBC, or who received a PD1/L1 inhibitor for mUC (n=50) and control untreated and temporally separated serial FFPE tumors without intervening therapy (n=10). scRNAseq is performed on a subset of post-PD1/L1 mUC tumors (n=20) to analyze tumor, stromal and immune cells. WES is performed for immunogenomic analyses using quality-controlled plasma cfDNA obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy or control untreated patients (n=40). The functional relevance of specific genomic alterations and resultant predicted neoantigens is studied by examining functional immune and stromal readouts, which will shed insights regarding the immunogenicity of genomic alterations that can then provide the foundation for therapeutic advances. We will develop a novel integrated model using deep learning architecture to account for the stationary snapshot of the molecular tumor, stromal and immune profiles, and the time-based trajectory of clinical data to computationally aggregate heterogeneous data types. To summarize, this innovative study is expected to provide discoveries regarding determinants of UC progression following PD1/L1 inhibitors, an incurable disease setting with substantial unmet needs. Project Narrative Progressive metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with persistent disease at radical cystectomy (RC) following PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors has significant unmet needs. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that tumor, microenvironmental and immune cell genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic factors determine resistance to PD-1/L1 inhibitor therapy and metastasis in MIBC and mUC, and that integrated bulk and single cell molecular dissection of pre-treatment and post- treatment resistant tumors will reveal these features. This innovative study uses deep learning computational techniques to probe tumor biology of 170 patients to dissect the evolution of urothelial carcinoma resistance to PD1/L1 inhibitors and reveal potentially actionable therapeutic targets.",Integrative molecular dissection of acquired resistance to PD1/PD-L1 blockade in localized and metastatic urothelial carcinoma,10218294,R21CA249875,"['Aftercare', 'Architecture', 'Biopsy', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Evolution', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genomics', 'Harvest', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Myomatous neoplasm', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'New Agents', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'PD-L1 blockade', 'PDL1 inhibitors', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Platinum', 'Ploidies', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stromal Cells', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Toxic effect', 'Transitional Cell Carcinoma', 'Transurethral Resection', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'exome sequencing', 'heterogenous data', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macrophage', 'muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'neoantigens', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimal treatments', 'pembrolizumab', 'peripheral blood', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2021,476334
"Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers ABSTRACT  Gynecologic cancers are among the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. These patients typically are socioeconomically disadvantaged, with poor access to screening and vaccination. Consequently, they often present with locoregionally advanced disease, for which pelvic radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent cisplatin (i.e., chemoradiotherapy) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of treatment failure. Intensifying treatment through the delivery of chemotherapy doublets, either concurrently or as adjuvant therapy following chemoradiotherapy, is a promising strategy to improve outcomes. However, the delivery of intensive chemotherapy is complicated by high rates of gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoradiotherapy are needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue including bowel, bone marrow, bone, bladder, and rectum, leading to preventable radiation-induced toxicity. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can improve target localization and dosimetry, optimizing target dose while minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. However, IGRT can be highly resource intensive, and comparative effectiveness trials have been lacking. For this reason, there is considerable controversy as to the utility of IG-IMRT in this disease. Our research group has been at the forefront of developing novel, cost-effective IGRT approaches with wide potential to facilitate better delivery of concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy.  Previously we have found that radiation-induced injury to hematopoietically active bone marrow is a critical determinant of tolerance to intensive chemotherapy. Using machine learning methods, we recently developed a multi-atlas-based IGRT method that can predict canonical distributions of active bone marrow, which can obviate the need for positron emission tomography (PET) in settings where this technology is unavailable or unaffordable. The proposed new research will study the ability of multi-atlas-based IGRT to reduce hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to standard treatment, using data from 450 patients enrolled to a randomized phase III trial (NRG-GY006). Furthermore, we will use serial whole body PET/CT to study the impact of radiation dose and chemotherapy intensity on the compensatory hematopoietic response, and have developed novel whole body radiomics biomarkers to quantify the inflammatory state, which we hypothesize can influence patients' outcomes and tolerance to chemotherapy.  The new research extends our work associated with a current R01 grant (1R01CA197059-01) to conduct correlative science associated with the GY006 trial. The overarching goal of this research line is to augment the therapeutic ratio of chemoradiotherapy for pelvic cancers using advanced image-guided radiation techniques. If successful, this research would significantly alter the approach to the treatment of many pelvic malignancies for which chemoradiotherapy is standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this study, we will test the ability of a novel method called multi-atlas-based image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to reduce acute hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to conventional RT, which could obviate the need for expensive functional imaging in socioeconomically disadvantaged and resource constrained populations, such as patients with gynecologic cancers. In addition, we will use serial positron emission tomography to study effects of chemotherapy and radiation on the subacute compensatory hematopoietic response, and will seek to develop and validate novel whole body radiomics models of the inflammatory state as predictive biomarkers for gynecologic cancers. We are in an optimal situation to conduct impactful and innovative research in the context of an ongoing phase III cooperative group randomized registration trial (NRG GY006), affording us the opportunity to conduct rigorous correlative science on a large sample with high data quality, quality assurance, and carefully controlled treatment effects.",Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers,10108128,R01CA255780,"['Acute', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Cisplatin', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Intestines', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Cancer', 'Pelvis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data quality', 'dosimetry', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'quality assurance', 'radiation-induced injury', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'whole body imaging']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,276286
"Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer Project Summary Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard of care for early stage (≥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point. Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1) Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients (≥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study, a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to appropriate treatment at an earlier time point. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer amongst women and treatment decisions are based heavily on accurate and early imaging. By developing a technique that evaluates response to treatment earlier than the current standard of care, we will decrease morbidity and mortality by treating cervical cancer at an earlier time point, preventing further progression of disease. The development of new biomedical imaging techniques to fundamentally improve the detection and treatment of disease is directly relevant to one of the key missions of the NIH.",Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer,10121726,R37CA249659,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Brain', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Free Will', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Indolent', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical properties', 'cancer imaging', 'chemoradiation', 'classification algorithm', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'nerve injury', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'radiation response', 'radical hysterectomy', 'response', 'screening program', 'standard of care', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake', 'water diffusion']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R37,2021,640083
"Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer ABSTRACT: In 2019, an estimated 228,150 patients in the US are expected to be diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A recent landmark development has been the approval of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1) for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. These immunotherapy (IO) drugs have an excellent toxicity profile and have the potential to induce durable clinically meaningful responses. However, only 1 in 5 NSCLC patients treated with IO will have a favorable response. Unfortunately, the current tissue based biomarker approach to selecting patients for these treatments is sub- optimal due to the dynamic nature of the interaction of the immune system with the tumor. Given the prohibitive costs associated with IO (>$200K/year per patient), there is a critical unmet need for predictive biomarkers to identify which patients will not benefit from IO. Additionally, the current clinical standard to evaluating tumor response (i.e. RECIST and irRC which evaluate change in tumor size and nodule disappearance) is sub-optimal in evaluating early clinical benefit from IO drugs. This is due at least in part to the fact that some patients undergoing IO present apparent disease progression (pseudo-progression) on post-treatment CT scans.  Unlike the standard canon of radiomics (computer extracted features from radiographic scans) that assess textural or shape patterns, our group has been developing novel computer vision strategies to capture patterns of peri-tumoral heterogeneity (outside the tumor) and tumor vasculature from CT scans. In N>300 patients, our group has shown that (1) radiomics of vessel tortuosity on baseline, pre-treatment CT for NSCLC patients undergoing IO were significantly different between responders (less tortuous) and non-responders (more tortuous), (2) serial changes in these measurements were better predictors of early response to IO compared to clinical response criteria such as RECIST and irRC and (3) these radiomic attributes were associated with PD-L1 expression and degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes on baseline biopsies. Critically, these radiomic features predicted response for NSCLC patients treated with 3 different IO agents from 3 sites.  In this project we will further develop vasculature, peri- and intra-tumoral radiomic features for monitoring and predicting benefit and early response for NSCLC patients treated with IO. We will uniquely train our radiomics using a set of N>180 resected NSCLC patients treated with first line IO and for whom we will have major pathologic response (MPR) as primary endpoint. In addition, we will establish the biological underpinnings of these predictive radiomic signatures by evaluating their association with the morphology, immune landscape (from biopsies) and molecular pathways of the tumor. In addition we have access to N>700 NSCLC patients treated on completed clinical trials via our industry partners (Astrazeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb) for tool validation. Finally, we will deploy LunIOTx within the ECOG-5163 (INSIGNA) trial (N>600), the first time that radiomics will be evaluated within a prospective cooperative group clinical trial for IO. RELEVANCE: Only 1 in 5 lung cancer patients treated with immunotherapy (IO) has a favorable response. Additionally, the cost of IO is extremely high, >$200K/year per patient. The goal of this project is to develop novel computational radiomic tools which in conjunction with routine CT scans from IO clinical trials will allow for (1) identifying pre-IO therapy as to which non-small cell lung cancer patients could potentially benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and (2) quantitatively monitor serial changes in tumor heterogeneity during IO treatment for early identification of responders and non-responders.",Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer,10233147,R01CA257612,"['Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Antitumor Response', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammatory', 'Institution', 'Letters', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nivolumab', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Outcome', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Resected', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-1/PD-L1', 'anti-PD-L1 therapy', 'base', 'cost', 'imaging biomarker', 'immunotherapy clinical trials', 'immunotherapy trials', 'industry partner', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'phase III trial', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic', 'prognostic of survival', 'prognostic value', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'success', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,619994
"Development of next generation 2HG and metabolic MR imaging for precision oncology of mutant IDH and wildtype glioma patients 7. Project Summary/Abstract Gliomas are rarely curable tumors with a low survival rate of 36% at five-years that is well below the average survival rate of 67.2% across all cancers, according to SEER and CBTRUS. Malignant brain tumors cause an average of 20 years of potential life lost (YPLL) for individuals diagnosed as adults, which exceeds most common cancers. Survival and YPLL have not improved for gliomas similarly to other cancers and progress is desperately needed. The lack of improvement in patient outcomes is not due to lack of new discoveries, but due to limited success in translating this knowledge into clinical benefit. Important discoveries have been made over the last decade regarding key molecular mechanisms involved in glioma initiation and growth, which have been incorporated in the latest WHO classification. IDH mutation is the primary event in glioma initiation and has become a paradigm shift in the treatment of glioma. Neuro-oncology experts (SNO, EANO) agree that brain imaging can accelerate clinical trials of targeted therapies and mandated the development of molecular imaging for highly specific and sensitive glioma imaging. The long-term goal of our research is the development of non-invasive molecular imaging methods that can be used clinically in cancer patients. IDH mutations are frequent in glioma and produce high levels of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) that can be imaged as a biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, guidance of surgery and radiation, response to chemotherapy and targeted treatments. The objective of this application is to develop fast high resolution whole brain quantitative 2HG and metabolic imaging for diagnosis, treatment guidance and monitoring of mutant IDH and wildtype glioma. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that advancing next generation 2HG and metabolic imaging will enable precision oncology and accelerate clinical translation of novel targeted therapies to improve outcomes in mutant IDH and wildtype glioma patients. Three specific aims will be performed for this: 1) develop fast high-resolution whole-brain clinically robust 2HG and metabolic imaging, 2) improve sensitivity, precision, accuracy and workflow of 2HG and metabolic imaging, and 3) clinical translation of next generation 2HG and metabolic imaging in glioma patients. There are strong rationales for the proposed research: 1) there is no alternative in vivo imaging method specific for IDH mutations, 2) 2HG imaging is completely non-invasive, can be repeated safe without any radiation, can provide results fast and cost effective, 3) provides comprehensive evaluation of the entire tumor and healthy brain without the sampling bias of biopsies, 4) it can be performed pre-surgically and in tumors that cannot be operated. The approach is innovative because it employs the first available whole brain 2HG imaging method, which will be accelerated by compressed sensing, novel shim hardware to improve data quality, and transformed in a high throughput automated tool by deep learning. The contribution of the proposed research will be significant because it will provide clinicians with a user-friendly and precise tool for diagnostic, guiding and monitoring of glioma patients. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance the capabilities of clinical MR scanners to image specific molecular signatures of primary brain tumors. The new features will provide rapid scanning, improved data quality, and automated data analytics for clinical use. This would enable precision oncology in patients with mutant IDH glioma tumors for early diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical translation of targeted therapies.

"Imaging Goggles for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery Interest in the use of optical imaging instruments in medical interventions stems from their ease of use, rapid adaptation to clinical needs, portability, real-time feedback, and relatively low cost. Of particular interest is the role of optical imaging in oncology. Surgery is the primary curative method for solid tumors confined to the tissue of origin with the goal of completely removing both the tumor mass and microscopic lesions. Unfortunately, the irregular growth pattern and infiltrations into surrounding healthy tissue prevent complete removal in many cases, resulting in positive surgical margins (PSMs). PSMs are prevalent in oncologic surgery, increasing cancer recurrence rates and often necessitates a second surgery to improve disease-specific survival. While PSM occurrence is significant in advanced clinical centers, the situation is worse in many rural hospitals and resource- limited areas due to limited histology infrastructure and workforce needed for margin assessment. Thus there is an urgent need for an intraoperative imaging system to visualize cancer, guide tumor removal, and determine margin positivity in the operating room (OR) in low and high resource settings alike.  Handheld fluorescence imaging systems have been developed to aid cancer resection. Still, they suffer from several limitations, including a significant footprint in the OR and the inability of the operating surgeon to directly control the imaging device while performing surgery. To address these shortcomings, we developed a head- mounted display device (HMD) cancer imaging system for real-time intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). The system HMD captures near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and color images from the surgical bed and displays accurately aligned color-NIR images in real-time, enabling FGS without disrupting surgical workflow. The HMD has a small footprint, is intuitive to use, and is amenable for widespread use, including non-cancer applications such as imaging of peripheral blood flow. Preliminary testing of the HMD system in human cancer patients identified some areas for improvement that will accelerate the eventual clinical adoption of the system worldwide. Addressing these needs requires expertise in packaging software development for medical devices with DICOM image format and user interface development using human factors engineering. We have teamed up with a company that has both expertise and experience in developing augmented reality/mixed reality (AR/VR) software combined with deep machine learning in wearable devices on this project. Together, we will optimize the system performance and ergonomics using human factors engineering. The collaborative project will (1) develop and validate an automated fluorescence thresholding algorithm for tumor delineation; (2) develop and validate automated registration of augmented reality in the system; and (3) develop and evaluate clinical software to improve user experience.  At the completion of this project, we expect to develop and validate a clinic-ready, user-friendly HMD system with a small hardware footprint, enabling seamless integration with surgical workflow to enhance clinical adoption. The system will increase the rates and decrease the time of successful tumor resection. Anticipated low cost and ease of use will expand adoption in low and high resource settings worldwide. This objective approach to cancer surgery will reduce the incidence of PSMs and improve treatment outcomes. Narrative  Optical imaging instruments have permeated medical practice because of their ease of use, rapid adaptation to clinical needs, portability, real-time feedback, and relatively low cost. We have developed a wearable head- mounted display device that is augmented by visible and near-infrared fluorescence imaging of tissues in real- time. In collaboration with an industry partner, we will optimize the device performance and ergonomics using human factors engineering.

"Correcting [18]F-Misonidazole PET with MRI and EPR to improve hypoxia-guided radiation therapy Project Summary  In this project, we propose to correct [18]F-Misonidazole (FMISO) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images to make PET be more accurate in measuring hypoxia. Hypoxia - a deficiency in oxygen - is a strong promotor of tumor radioresistance, yet there are no established clinical methods to accurately image oxygenation in vivo to improve treatment. Preclinical studies that acquired pO2 measurements using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging have shown that targeting hypoxic tumor sub-regions with a boost of TCD95 after irradiating the whole tumor with TCD15, significantly increased tumor control when compared to the boosting normoxic tumor sub-regions with TCD95. So far this has been demonstrated in fibrosarcoma (p = 0.04) and mammary carcinoma (p = 0.013) tumor types. This shows that if hypoxic tumor sub-regions can be accurately imaged and targeted with a boosted dose – better known as dose painting – the overall dose deposition to surrounding healthy tissues can be decreased while improving tumor control.  In recent years, clinical trials have used FMISO PET for radiation therapy dose plans with the hypothesis that targeting hypoxic tumor regions with a boost of radiation, as defined by FMISO uptake, would increase survival. These trials did not, however, show improvement when compared to treatment plans with and without a boost of radiation. These outcomes are in direct contrast to the EPR hypoxia studies previously mentioned. We hypothesize this is due to the imperfect binding mechanisms of FMISO to hypoxic cells, as well as general limitations of PET tracers being unable to reach hypoxic tumor regions due to their chaotic vasculature or acidosis. In response to the failure of using only FMISO PET to target hypoxia, we propose to include anatomical and physiological information of tumor vasculature and pH imaged with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, respectively. DCE-MRI and CEST-MRI will be used to correct the PET image to show hypoxic tumor regions, using EPR as the ground truth of hypoxia.  The specific aims of the proposal are to develop and execute a study design to (1) evaluate discrepancies between tumor hypoxia regions as defined by FMISO PET and EPR, (2) identify tumor features in DCE-MRI and CEST-MRI that result in poor overlap between hypoxia as defined by PET and EPR, and (3) develop a correction PET/MRI algorithm to improve PET measurement of hypoxia, using EPR hypoxia measurements as the gold standard. Upon completion, aim 1 will demonstrate the need for correcting FMISO PET images. Aim 2 will identify correlations between vascular permeability and pH features and low or high PET uptake, where it might not match with hypoxia as defined by EPR. The third aim will take those features to create a decision tree algorithm to correct FMISO PET definition of hypoxia. We intend for this PET/MRI correction algorithm to eventually be implemented in clinical trials to improve radiation therapy to hypoxic tumors. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to make FMISO PET more accurate in its measurement of tumor hypoxia. We aim to correct PET data with a combination of MRI images that map physiological properties of the tumor, such as vasculature and pH measurements, while using oxygen measurements from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging as the ground truth. This work will result in a PET/MRI correction algorithm with the intent to improve radiotherapy techniques and results.",Correcting [18]F-Misonidazole PET with MRI and EPR to improve hypoxia-guided radiation therapy,10234423,F31CA254223,"['Acidosis', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Body Temperature', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Deposition', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Rate', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia Inducible Factor', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misonidazole', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'experimental study', 'fibrosarcoma', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'promoter', 'radiation resistance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor hypoxia', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2021,46036
"Development of a Bio-tissue Oxygenation Nanophosphor Enabled Sensing (BONES) system for Quantifying Hypoxia in Bone Marrow Project Summary/Abstract Low oxygen (hypoxic) environments are known to be important for maintaining the small number of adult stem cells in the human body, such as in bone marrow. These conditions are also believed to enable dormant cancer cells to survive and metastasize years or decades after the original tumor has been destroyed and the reason why bone marrow is one of the most common sites of cancer metastasis. Understanding of these conditions can drive the development of 3D cellular scaffolds for growing stem cells ex vivo, thus reducing the burden on requiring bone marrow transplants, and for developing therapeutics that prevent cancer relapse. This project proposes to develop the first quantitative oxygen tomographic imaging system called BONES (Bio-tissue Oxygenation Nanophosphor Enabled Sensing) to address the critical need for high resolution imaging of oxygen concentrations in hypoxic (low oxygen) tissues such as bone marrow. The technique is based on developments in x-ray luminescence computed tomography, an emerging molecular imaging technique capable of achieving cellular level resolution and high sensitivities. The approach uses x-rays to excite oxygen-sensitive nanophosphors that emit near-infrared photons to finally enable 3D oxygen measurements in deep bone marrow. Because the technique requires a multidisciplinary team with x-ray expertise, nanophosphor expertise, near-infrared detection expertise, and algorithms for quantifying the concentrations and minimizing dose, this STTR fast-track proposal involves several institutions with deep expertise in their respective domains. The proposed Phase I 6-month project is a proof-of- principle demonstration of a breadboard system used on nanophosphors in low oxygen solutions and embedded in bone. The proposed Phase II 24-month project is to develop a complete prototype system and experimentally verify its performance. Project Narrative This project proposes to develop the first quantitative oxygen tomographic imaging system called BONES (Bio-tissue Oxygenation Nanophosphor Enabled Sensing) to address the critical need for high resolution imaging of oxygen concentrations in hypoxic (low oxygen) tissues such as bone marrow. Local oxygen microenvironments and changes to oxygen tensions over only tens of micrometers are known to be important for maintaining stem cell growth and are suspected to also enable cancer metastases, but are poorly understood because there are no methods with the resolution and sensitivity required. The proposed solution will finally enable 3D oxygen measurements in deep bone marrow based on a newly developed technique called x- ray luminescence computed tomography (XLCT) and oxygen-sensitive nanophosphors for 10 to 100 µm imaging of oxygen concentrations.",Development of a Bio-tissue Oxygenation Nanophosphor Enabled Sensing (BONES) system for Quantifying Hypoxia in Bone Marrow,10255544,R42GM142394,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Fiber', 'Film', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human body', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institution', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Oxygen', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Photons', 'Production', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Spatial Design', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visible Radiation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adult stem cell', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer cell', 'cancer site', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'denoising', 'design and construction', 'detector', 'high resolution imaging', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'insight', 'luminescence', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'phosphorescence', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'response', 'scaffold', 'stem cell growth', 'stem cells', 'therapeutic effectiveness', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tomography', 'transmission process', 'tumor', 'two-photon']",NIGMS,"SIGRAY, INC.",R42,2021,252113
"High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy Project Summary: In prostate cancer (PCa), the presence and amount of residual tumor at the surface of the excised prostate is the only prognostic factor that is affected by surgical technique, vs. other factors, which are fixed and non-modifiable. Yet, positive surgical margins (PSM), defined as the presence of tumor cells at the inked surface of the removed specimen, are common, especially in advanced stage cancers, and are a strong independent risk factor for clinical progression and secondary treatment. In addition, elevated post-operative PSA, which is understood to be related to tumor left behind in the patient, is also associated with high risk of progression and secondary treatment. Thus, complete tumor removal is important to achieve to improve  patient outcomes and reduce overtreatment, yet there is a delicate balance between resection radicality and  minimizing damage to the neurovascular bundles to preserve post-operative function. The NeuroSAFE trial demonstrated that real-time detection and correction of PSMs by comprehensive histology of the prostate  circumference results in improved patient outcomes, yet there are no widely adoptable methods to achieve this. In an effort to address this technical gap, we have developed video-rate structured illumination microscopy (VR-SIM) and demonstrated that it enables accurate diagnosis of PCa in the biopsy setting, and that it can  rapidly deliver gigapixel microscopic images of the entire prostate surface for detection of PSMs. VR-SIM delivers the surface area coverage and resolution needed to detect PSMs, yet it is also fast and relatively simple and inexpensive, opening the possibility for widespread adoption. In this project, our interdisciplinary team of  engineers and clinicians with significant prostate expertise will further advance this technology towards clinical translation, by completing critical technology development steps and by prospectively validating it in a large patient series. Specifically, we will increase the mechanical automation speed of the device, and will develop a fully automated system for handling of the removed prostate, to enable gigapixel panoramas of the entire  prostate circumferential surface to be delivered within 10 minutes of removal and with minimal tissue processing and user intervention. We will then leverage our recently developed dual-color fluorescent stain that replicates standard H&E with high specificity, to develop expert-validated clinical image atlases using biopsies and  cadaveric specimens to enhance image interpretation of VR-SIM prostate panoramas. These improvements will be combined to test the system in a prospective 250-patient clinical study, to determine the accuracy of the device for intra-operative detection of PSMs and prediction of post-operative PSA based on measurement of PSM extent. Finally, we will measure and model expert reviewer behavior using a novel web-enabled visual observer tracking method, which could be used in future computer-assisted search algorithms to expedite  intra-operative image review. Successful completion will set the stage for multi-center clinical trials to validate the clinical utility of VR-SIM for real-time detection and correction of PSMs, and improvement of patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Achieving complete tumor removal in prostate cancer is an important goal to achieve because leaving tumor behind in the patient contributes to increased risk of cancer progression and need for additional harmful treatment. Yet, it is difficult to determine in real-time if surgery is successful due to the lack of available technologies for intra-operative guidance. This project will develop a rapid scanner that will automatically scan the entire prostate surface for residual tumor within 10 minutes of removal, providing images which are readily interpreted by trained pathologists and enabling real-time guidance of nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery.",High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy,10172866,R01CA222831,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Case Series', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Computer Assisted', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Frozen Sections', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Ink', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nerve', 'Online Systems', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface of the Prostate', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analog', 'authority', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'cancer surgery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer aided detection', 'contrast imaging', 'diagnostic technologies', 'high risk', 'histological image', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurovascular', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate surgery', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'visual search', 'web-enabled']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2021,397823
"FAST-FNA immune cell profiling in HNSCC Currently, the single best predictive biomarker of response to anti-PD1 monotherapy is PD-L1 expression as assessed by immunohistochemical staining of archived or fresh tissue. Current workflows for PD-L1 assessment in tissue are labor and time consuming, are not infallible (inconclusive results in a fraction of image guided biopsies) and are associated with morbidity and are thus rarely performed serially. Rapid on site assessment of cellular, rather than tissue, specimens obtained through fine needle aspiration (FNA) could not only circumvent these bottlenecks but also enable more comprehensive and serial profiling of the tumor microenvironment to obtain the most up-to-date information of a rapidly changing microenvironment during tumor evolution and therapy. The goal of this project is to further develop and validate the new FAST-FNA technology for rapid biomarker discovery and validation in HNSCCs. There are two main aims. In aim 1 we will develop and validate existing and new biomarkers in FNA samples of HNSCC patients (n=100). Specifically we will I) develop and validate new predictive immunotherapeutic biomarkers and ii to determine how well the new FAST-FNA scores correlate with the CPS scores of PD-L1. The goal of the second aim is to translate the above FAST-FNA technology to serial FNA analyses in HNSCC patients receiving anti-PD1 immunotherapy (with or without chemotherapy; n=100). FNA sampling will be performed pre- and on-treatment in order to capture changes in the tumor microenvironment. As the HNSCC field shifts toward increased biomarker testing, we find an unmet clinical need to develop advanced cellular diagnostics in HNSCCs, which will facilitate rapid biomarker analysis, guide therapies and provide “real time” assessment of clinical response. Existing analysis of HNSCC cancer tissues obtained by core biopsy is limited in many aspects. We have developed a new immune and cancer cell profiling technology based on cellular immunocycling. Using fine needle aspirates (FNA) rather than more invasive core biopsies, this method allows frequent and serial profiling on the composition of the tumor microenvironment in HNSCC patients undergoing immunotherapy.",FAST-FNA immune cell profiling in HNSCC,10154199,R01CA257623,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Clinical assessments', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Diagnostic', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Quality Control', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sedation procedure', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer cell', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'companion diagnostics', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,670725
"Rational translation of gold nanoparticle mediated radiosensitization tothe clinic The use of high atomic number (Z) elements as radiosensitizers of tumors has been well documented in the literature over the last few decades. In particular, gold nanoparticles (GNPs), typically defined as high-Z gold structures with the longest dimension smaller than 100 nm, have been the subject of active investigation for the same purpose for the past 15 years. Early in vivo demonstration of GNP-mediated radiosensitization (GMR) effect was based on passive accumulation of GNPs within tumors (“passive targeting”). While resulting in a remarkable level of GMR, this approach generally requires clinically less relevant radiation quality (low energy kilovoltage x-rays) and clinically unachievable (without direct injection) gold concentration (up to 7mg gold per gram of tumor). To overcome these difficulties, we have been investigating an alternative approach based on “active targeting” which shows a promising outlook for clinical translation in the near term. This proposal seeks to surmount the remaining challenges associated with our active targeting-based approach before embarking on clinical translation of GMR. Specifically, we aim to identify the molecular mechanism of GMR, biodistribution and kinetics of GNPs developed for clinical translation, their fate at the tumor and cellular levels, and the correlation between GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR. Despite abundant data and publications on GMR accumulated over the years, critical knowledge gaps still exist in terms of the aforementioned aspects, hindering clinical translation of GMR. As demonstrated in our preliminary data, we propose to address such issues that hold the key for clinical translation of GMR, through concerted multidisciplinary efforts. Upon achieving this goal, a pilot human trial of GNP-enhanced radiation therapy (RT) will also be conducted within this project for the management of recurrent rectal cancer. Overall, we will pursue three Specific Aims shown below to achieve the goals of this project. (1) To determine the molecular mechanism of GMR, the biodistribution/kinetics of GNPs in vitro and in vivo, and the radiosensitization efficacy in clinically relevant treatment scenarios, (2) To correlate GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR using high resolution image-based cell/tissue models and nanoscale computational techniques, and (3) To conduct a pilot human trial of GNP-enhanced RT for previously radiated recurrent rectal cancers. Ultimately, this project would lay the foundation for widespread applications of the currently envisioned RT paradigm that enables more potent and tumor-specific RT with less toxicity. Increasing the radiation dose delivered to rectal cancers treated preoperatively can improve pathological response at the time of surgery and possibly even obviate the need for surgery but this has been challenging to implement in the clinic due to the limited radiation tolerance of the surrounding normal intestinal loops. Gold nanoparticles that preferentially accumulate in tumors offer the possibility to increase radiation dose within the tumor without damaging adjacent normal tissues. To amplify this radiation dose enhancement, we propose to advance clinical translation of a paradigm using gold nanoparticles that home to the tumor, get internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, disperse in the cytoplasm via co-administered pharmacological agents, and can be modeled by mathematical techniques that predict the biological consequences of tumor accumulation.",Rational translation of gold nanoparticle mediated radiosensitization tothe clinic,10144062,R01CA257241,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Double Strand Break Repair', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High-LET Radiation', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Injections', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Mediating', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nanotechnology', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacology', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Radiosensitization', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Recurrence', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Tumor Tissue', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'dosage', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'irradiation', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoGold', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'radiation response', 'receptor internalization', 'receptor mediated endocytosis', 'response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2021,631688
"Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  A major challenge in the management of advanced ovarian cancer is the presence of disseminated microscopic tumor nodules within the intraperitoneal cavity. Despite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, as many as 50% of patients can show occult disseminated disease, with only a 43% survival rate. Furthermore, systemic chemotherapy can have toxic side effects. Thus, recent efforts have aimed at improving detection and treatment of micromets. Chemophototherapy (CPT), the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, is an emerging cancer treatment modality that can provide synergistic efficacy of both therapies. The overall goal is to implement a quantitative laparoscopic imaging and treatment approach for advanced detection of micromets and optimization of CPT for targeted destruction of ovarian micromets and reduced toxic side effects. Quantitative fluorescence laparoscopic imaging will provide high sensitivity and resolution for detecting micromets as well as image guided drug delivery. Folate receptor alpha (FA) will be used as a promising target because it is highly specific of epithelial ovarian cancer. The proposed targeted CPT compound has a ~6-fold tumor-specificity providing enhanced fluorescence contrast. These folate-targeted, porphyrin-phospholipid doped liposomes are triggered directly by near infrared (NIR) light. This activates the anti-cancer photosensitizer outer layer and releases the anti-cancer agent Doxorubicin (Dox). While this nanocarrier is expected to improve detection of micromets, tissue absorption and scattering in living tissue can confound fluorescence contrast. Quantitative imaging based on spatial frequency domain imaging can eliminate these confounding effects and provide quantitative contrasts to enable more sensitive detection compared to raw fluorescence or white light visualization. Furthermore, this quantitative capability can function in near-real-time to provide feedback on drug release, thus allowing image-guided optimization of treatment light to ensure full drug release within each tumor. In Aim 1, a wide-field dual-channel laparoscope, fast quantification algorithms and targeted liposomal nano-construct will be implemented and optimized. In Aim 2, the platform will be validated in vivo for improved detection of micromets vs. raw fluorescence and white light. In Aim 3, the platform’s efficacy will be validated in vivo for destroying micromets in targeted tumors while reducing toxicity to surrounding normal tissues. Successful completion of this approach is expected to result in improved detection and treatment of micromets with reduced side effects. This is ultimately expected to lead to reduced recurrence rates and overall improved survival. Although this imaging approach focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment, it can be applicable to a wide range of epithelial diseases, such as oral, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers. NARRATIVE A quantitative laparoscopic spatial frequency domain imaging platform is proposed to map intraperitoneal ovarian metastases as well as to treat them effectively via targeted chemo-photo therapy. Cancer-targeting drug and optimized light delivery will allow local release and preferential uptake of the drug into tumors versus normal tissue for optimal cancer cell destruction with minimal side effects to the surrounding normal tissue. This approach is relevant to public health as it is expected to significantly improve detection and destruction of micromets in ovarian cancer patients, and reduce side effects in normal tissue, thereby fulfilling the overarching goal of improving patients’ survival rates and quality of life.",Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases,10219200,R01CA243164,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biodistribution', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial ovarian cancer', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'FOLR1 gene', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Folic Acid', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Laparoscopes', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Liposomal Doxorubicin', 'Liposomes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm to the Ovary', 'Micrometastasis', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nodule', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian Carcinoma', 'PUVA Photochemotherapy', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phospholipids', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Phototherapy', 'Physiological', 'Platinum', 'Porphyrins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'anti-cancer', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'contrast enhanced', 'controlled release', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided drug delivery', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'intraperitoneal', 'liposome vector', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'nano', 'nanocarrier', 'nanomedicine', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'phantom model', 'quantitative imaging', 'side effect', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity', 'uptake']",NCI,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,336645
"Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas Project Summary/Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal malignancy of the human central nervous system (CNS). This devastating disease has a median overall survival of 3 months from time of diagnosis in untreated patients. Despite the significant cost and morbidity with standard of care surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, life expectancy is only extended by a few months. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are a class of immunotherapies with an FDA-approved treatment for solid tumors. These work by directly lysing tumor cells, which then release tumor antigens with danger signals that elicit antitumor immunity. Adenovirus is a strong candidate OV immunotherapy for GBM because of its low neurotoxicity when delivered by intratumoral injection and its amenability to bioengineering. Ad5-Δ24, an adenovirus modified to replicate in GBM but not in other CNS cells, is perhaps the most promising OV in clinical trials. Major hurdles remain, however, including innate immunoresistance. This study will overcome these by elucidating complex tumor-OV interaction mechanisms at the systems level, designing and constructing improved OV candidates that exploit these mechanisms, and then validating the mechanisms by experimentally testing the OVs. Preliminary studies for this proposal demonstrate that GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have distinct transcriptomes in vivo and can be cultured as neurospheres (Sp-GBMs) under serum-free conditions ex vivo. Ad5-Δ24 OV can lyse several different Sp-GBMs ex vivo and the level of this oncolytic activity is PDX specific. Additionally, preliminary in silico models suggest that such OV activity levels are contextually dependent on protein-protein interaction networks in the target GBM cells. This project will test the central hypothesis that dynamic transcriptional states of human GBM play key mechanistic roles in Ad5-Δ24 oncolytic efficacy; therefore, modeling the emergent system behaviors will guide the engineering of precision OV immunotherapies. The first aim will classify human GBM PDXs using transcriptomes to predict Ad5-Δ24 OV responses and identify context-specific network features. The resulting classifier and network models will be validated by assessing their ability to predict the response of Sp-GBM to Ad5-Δ24 OV treatment. The second aim will elucidate Ad5- Δ24 OV gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms in human GBM PDXs. Predictions from both aims will both experimentally and computationally validated. Synthetic Ad5-Δ24 OVs with shRNAs that perturb these gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms will be constructed and tested for efficacy. These precisely targeted alterations result in the quantifiable, predictable phenotypic effects of modulating human GBM gene expression and oncolysis ex vivo and in vivo. Such synthetic OVs will be useful as GBM research tools. As a future direction, the big data generated will be a valuable public resource to further interrogate antitumor immunity and inflammation states. Successful completion of these aims will yield novel GBM diagnostic subtypes with paired engineered OVs ready for preclinical development as precision immunotherapies. Project Narrative Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common lethal brain tumor. This research aims to develop a novel immunotherapy using engineered viruses to treat this tumor with minimal side effects. The results from this study will also provide mechanistic insight into the disease and guide future clinical trials to treat this tumor.",Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas,10231604,F30CA250122,"['Adenoviruses', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Astrocytes', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferons', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neuraxis', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Serotyping', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'efficacy testing', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'multiple omics', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncolysis', 'oncolytic adenovirus', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'preclinical development', 'predicting response', 'protein protein interaction', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'retinoblastoma tumor suppressor', 'side effect', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small hairpin RNA', 'standard of care', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'viral resistance']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,F30,2021,46236
"Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry Abstract Photon-counting CT (PCCT) is a major technological advance in CT imaging. Using photon-counting instead of current energy-integrating detectors, PCCT can offer superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, artifact reduction, and most notably, material decomposition. PCCT’s energy differentiation utility offers an ability to more precisely distinguish different materials and optimize and expand the use of contrast agents in CT. With these abilities, PCCT can significantly facilitate quantitative imaging, reduce radiation exposure, and enable revolutionary new applications in functional and physiological imaging beyond existing CT techniques. To realize the full potential of PCCT in clinical practice, the technology needs comprehensive assessments and application-based optimizations. Effective design and deployment of PCCT depends on many design and use choices that should be made in view of the eventual clinical utility. Making these choices requires large scale trials on actual patients. However, such trials are challenging, considering the need to make many decisions prior to prototyping, the limited numbers of prototype PCCT scanners available today, and the often-unknown ground-truth in the patient images. Even for existing prototype systems, many decisions require repetitive trials with multiple acquisitions. This is both unethical and impractical considering radiation safety concerns and costs. These challenges can be overcome by utilizing virtual imaging trials (VITs) using computerized patients and imaging models. VITs provide an efficient means with which to determine the most effective and optimized design and use of imaging technologies with complete control over the study design. In our prior funded project, we developed a VIT framework to evaluate standard energy-integrating detector CT technologies. In this project, we expand the applicability of this framework to photon-counting detector CT. Specifically, we enhance our computational XCAT phantoms to model the necessary higher-resolution detail including normal and abnormal tissue heterogeneities and intra-organ contrast perfusion diversity across populations (Aim 1). To image the phantoms, we develop the first PCCT simulator capable of mimicking existing and emerging prototypes (Aim 2). The enhanced VIT framework will provide the essential foundation with which to comprehensively evaluate and optimize PCCT technologies and applications. In Aim 3, we assess and optimize the use of PCCT for morphological, textural, and compositional quantification in select oncologic and cardiac applications, two leading health detriments in the US where PCCT can offer a notable impact. The results will be the first of their kind in comprehensively evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of PCCT, determining optimum dose per patient size for PCCT imaging of patients for cancerous lesions and cardiac plaque/stenoses, and helping to establish the effective utility of PCCT in clinical care. The purpose of this project is to develop and utilize a virtual framework to comprehensively evaluate and optimize emerging photon-counting devices and applications in CT imaging. The results will be the first of their kind evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of photon-counting CT and will help establish its effectual utility in oncologic and cardiac care.",Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry,10189580,R01EB001838,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Anatomy', 'Cancerous', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging technology', 'Industry', 'Lesion', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stenosis', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiac plaque', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'dosimetry', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'photon-counting detector', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'unethical', 'virtual', 'virtual imaging']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,534495
"Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Abstract PET is a molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology studies due to its high sensitivity and the potential of early diagnosis. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET has been recently used in clinical routine for imaging NETs in adult and pediatric patients since 2016. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of NETs. However, compared to 18F-FDG PET, the image quality of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is lower due to much larger positron range, shorter half-life, and lower dose administration limited by generator capacity. All of these compromises the lesion detectability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET, especially for small lesions, and can potentially lead to inaccurate NET diagnosis. As 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is increasingly used in clinics, there is an urgent and unmet need to further optimize 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging for NET detection. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed for PET image denoising, where the PET system model is not considered. As the tumor-to-background ratio of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is greater than 18F-FDG PET, the lesion recovery of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET can be hugely influenced by the smoothing effects as well as potential mismatches between training and testing datasets. In this study, we propose a novel data- informed and lesion detection-driven image reconstruction framework. The PET system model, image denoising module, and lesion-detection module will all be included in this reconstruction framework. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework and validate it based on comprehensive computer simulations, (2) to apply the proposed reconstruction framework to existing clinical 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT datasets and test it based on various figure-of-merits. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be a novel and robust image reconstruction framework to better recover lesions in a 68Ga- DOTATATE PET scan, which is essential for NET managements. Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection  Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology. This project aims to develop a novel lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework. Success of this project can enhance the lesion detectability of current PET imaging protocols, e.g. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).",Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection,10206141,R03EB030280,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gallium', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer type', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neuroendocrine differentiation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'pentetreotide', 'radiologist', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'routine imaging', 'success', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,89563
"Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas PROJECT SUMMARY Meningiomas, which arise from arachnoid cells, make up >1/3 of all intracranial tumors. While typically benign, these tumors induce clinical symptoms due to mass effect and peritumoral edema. In cases requiring intervention, gross total resection provides the best outcomes when possible. However, treatment strategy is ultimately decided by determining the proper balance between surgical difficulty and the patient's overall health. Two mechanical properties are important predictors of surgical difficulty: tumor stiffness and adherence to surrounding tissues. Knowledge of these properties before surgery would allow clinicians to more accurately assess surgical risk and identify the most effective treatment strategy. Mechanical properties are difficult to predict by conventional imaging approaches, but can be directly assessed by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and related Slip Interface Imaging (SII). In published studies, we have shown that MRE-based stiffness estimates are significantly correlated with tumor stiffness in meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Furthermore, SII accurately predicted tumor adherence in meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. Still, challenges remain to make these findings clinically-impactful. For estimating stiffness, the primary limitation lies in resolution. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will develop a voxel- wise classifier of tumor stiffness. This aim will build on our recently published neural network-based inversion (NNI), which has demonstrated superior performance to conventional direct inversions in simulation and in the brain. In Aim 1a, we will advance NNI by implementing more complex neural network architectures and creating more realistic simulations for training. In Aim 1b, the advances will be validated in a phantom with inhomogeneous stiffness. Finally, in Aim 1c with the aid of our Neurosurgery collaborators, we will collect a large sample of surgical stiffness assessments. We will use these assessments to train a voxel-wise stiffness classifier, which will then be validated in a separate test set. This aim will result in a map that conveys both stiffness and confidence in the prediction on a scale that is clinically meaningful to surgeons. The most-pressing limitations in SII include the subjective interpretation of the images and the lack of spatially resolved predictions. Aim 2 will address these challenges by developing a voxel-wise slip interface classifier. In Aim 2a, we will investigate a neural network-based predictor of slip interfaces to add to our current methods. In Aim 2b, we will evaluate if this new method can improve predictions in phantom experiments. In Aim 2c, we will again leverage surgical assessments of meningioma adherence to train and test a voxel-wise classifier. The result of this aim will be a map of tumor adherence represented as an easily interpreted probability. Taken together, these aims will provide neurosurgeons with clinically-important information to improve patient management. More broadly, technical advances made in this project will impact the entire MRE field. PROJECT NARRATIVE Meningiomas are the most common type of intracranial tumor and are best treated by total resection when possible. The mechanical properties of these tumors are important factors in surgical difficulty, where soft, non- adherent tumors are more easily removed that firm or adherent tumors. This project will use Magnetic Resonance Elastography and related Slip Interface Imaging to directly measure these properties, providing new clinically-important information to neurosurgeons and patients.",Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas,10071162,R01EB027064,"['Acoustic Neuroma', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Arachnoid mater', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Skull Base Neoplasms', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'mechanical properties', 'meningioma', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neurosurgery', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,350595
"OpenIGTLink: a network communication interface for closed-loop image-guided interventions Project Summary/Abstract In this cycle of the project, we will extend OpenIGTLink software to enable individualized precision guidance, where patient-specific characteristics are taken into account in the planning and control process for image- guided robotic interventions (IGRI) to achieve a better clinical outcome. In particular, we will focus on improving needle placement accuracy for IGRI of the prostate, as a simple, and yet a representative application of individualized precision guidance. Percutaneous needle placement plays a fundamental role in both the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Nearly one million prostate biopsies are performed annually in the United States, where tissues are sampled from the prostate with a biopsy needle for pathological examination. The confirmed lesions may then be focally treated with brachytherapy or thermal ablation using applicator needles depending on clinical indications and patient preference. For those procedures, accurate needle placement is essential to avoid false-negatives or ensure an optimal dose distribution. The demand for accurate needle placement is growing in recent years, as clinicians are now capable of pinpointing subregions in a heterogeneous tumor thanks to the recent progress in imaging technologies, particularly multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the in vivo accuracies achieved by previous studies have never matched the level of tumor subregion targeting due to needle deviation as a result of physical interaction between the needle and the heterogeneous tissue. To address this issue, we will incorporate needle deviation models in an IGRI system using OpenIGTLink software. Our hypothesis is that the models adapted to individual patients will enable avoidance or compensation of needle deviation, leading to an improved in vivo needle placement accuracy. The project comprises the following four specific aims: (Aim 1) Develop a biomechanical model with image-based semi-automatic model generation; (Aim 2) Develop a data-driven prediction model and hybridize with the biomechanical model; (Aim 3) Extend the IGRI platform for model- based closed-loop control using OpenIGTLink; (Aim 4) Evaluate biomechanical, data-driven, and hybrid models in vivo needle placement. Project Narrative Percutaneous needle placement plays a fundamental role in biopsy and focal ablation of prostate cancer. The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate free open-source software named OpenIGTLink to support advanced image-guided robot-assisted systems, where a robotic system guides a needle into the prostate based on biomechanical, data-driven, and hybrid models that predict the tissue and needle deformation in the patient during insertion. We expect that the accurate prediction will enable individualized planning and control for robot-assisted needle placement and improve accuracy biopsy and focal ablation.",OpenIGTLink: a network communication interface for closed-loop image-guided interventions,10211359,R01EB020667,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brachytherapy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Financial compensation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Ablation', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Structure of base of prostate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical practice', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'individual patient', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'real-time images', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'robotic system', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tumor']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,701392
"In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections Summary Extent-of-resection is correlated with glioma patient outcomes such as progression-free survival. Image- guidance technologies, based on MRI and now fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), have been developed to improve the surgeon’s ability to visualize gross tumor margins. However, there are fundamental limitations to wide-field imaging methods such as MRI and FGS, such as poor sensitivity to detect disseminated tumor cells at the infiltrative margins of diffuse gliomas, as well as the non-quantitative and subjective nature of image interpretation. With the emergence of FGS using 5-ALA, and its recent approval by the FDA in 2017, the gap between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) patients, in terms of extent of resection, will likely widen since LGGs rarely generate sufficient PpIX fluorescence to be detected via wide-field FGS. Consequently, there is a clear need for improved intraoperative techniques with the sensitivity to detect and quantify residual LGGs at the margins of the tumor cavity in order to improve the extent of resection and delay recurrence. We have shown that high-resolution confocal microscopy has the sensitivity to visualize the sparse sub-cellular expression of PpIX in LGG patients treated with 5-ALA, even beyond the radiographic margins. Therefore, we will optimize a handheld optical-sectioning microscope to image 5-ALA-induced PpIX at the final resection margins in LGG patients, together with real-time video mosaicking to facilitate the imaging of large tissue areas, which will minimize sampling bias when imaging heterogeneous brain tissues (Aim 1). In order to facilitate the clinical acceptance of these techniques, we will establish a relationship between the microscopic patterns of PpIX expression and well-established biological metrics such as tumor burden and proliferative index (Aim 2). Finally, we will explore the hypothesis that quantitative microscopic imaging of PpIX of the resection margins is predictive of extent of resection, as currently defined by post-operative MRI, which would suggest that it has value for optimizing resections to minimize and/or delay recurrence (Aim 3). Collectively, these results will pave the way for future randomized controlled clinical studies to optimize resection procedures and outcomes for LGG patients (adults and children), many of whom can have good survival outcomes and quality of life. Relevance to public health We are developing a set of technologies to enable real-time intraoperative microscopy of the final resection margins of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients who have been administered with 5-ALA prior to surgery (FDA approved in 2017). These quantitative and sensitive imaging techniques have the potential to improve the extent of resection for LGG patients, and therefore to improve patient outcomes such as overall survival and progression-free survival (time to recurrence).",In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections,10146311,R01CA244170,"['Adult', 'Aminolevulinic Acid', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biophotonics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Glioma', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Institutes', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proliferation Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sterility', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Burden', 'Validation', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'lens', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'overexpression', 'prototype', 'survival outcome', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,579585
"Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Abstract Candidate's Career Goals: Dr. Han has a strong background in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, image reconstruction and arterial spin labeling (ASL), with a Ph.D. in bio and brain engineering. Dr. Han is currently at a junior-faculty rank of instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). His goal is to expand his future career to multi-modality positron emission tomography (PET)-MR imaging for translational research and clinical improvement. His long-term goal is to become an independent, accomplished investigator that can lead future scientific and clinical imaging projects taking full advantage of multi-modality PET-MR imaging. Career Development Plan: Foundational training in PET/PET-MR imaging as well as neurology is proposed for the candidate, an area that the candidate currently lacks knowledge and experience in. The candidate plans to engage in formal course work/seminars, research via one-on-one instructions with mentors and collaborators, conferences/presentations, manuscript/grant preparations, and teaching/leadership roles to grow as an independent investigator in the field of PET-MR imaging and neurology. Research Project: The overall goal of the proposed research is to take advantage of simultaneous dynamic PET and ASL-MR imaging to estimate the permeability surface product (PS) of the PET tracer, which is new physiological information that cannot be obtained with PET or MR alone. PS describes the unidirectional flux rate of macromolecules from the blood plasma into the interstitial space of cellular tissue and is the key metric for assessing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Knowing the PS of the PET tracer provides powerful capability to probe the physiological delivery process of essential macromolecules involved in the pathogenesis of diseases in relation to BBB, due to the theoretically unlimiting potential in the design of radioactive analogs of important biological compounds. We plan to develop a PET tracer PS mapping method, achieve the first phantom and human study with PS mapping, and study the changes in the spatial distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and amyloid-beta (Aß) plaque depositions in relation to the BBB integrity changes with pathological events associated with the progression of AD, by performing dynamic-PET/mPLD-ASL studies using 18F-T807 and 11C- Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET tracers on AD and normal subjects. Environment: MGH provides an ideal setting for conducting research in MR, PET, and PET-MR imaging since multiple state-of-the-art imaging systems are available for preclinical/clinical MR scanners and preclinical simultaneous PET-MR scanners. There is a dynamic flow phantom designed to simulate blood flow for two compartment pharmacokinetics and an MR-compatible pump and detection system for continuous blood sampling suitable for performing ASL flow and PET imaging studies with arterial sampling. Also, there is a shared memory supercomputer ideal for the image reconstruction proposed in the project. MGH is also home to many experts in both PET-MR imaging and neurology who can provide their expertise to this project.

If successful, the proposed technique will allow the extraction of new physiological information, PS, while facilitating a new understanding of the relationships between BBB integrity, neurovascular function and proteinopathy in the etiology and progression of diseases such as AD.",Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI,10217132,K01EB030045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Amino Acids', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood flow', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Instruction', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Physiological', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Radial', 'Radioactive', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senile Plaques', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spin Labels', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'analog', 'attenuation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical imaging', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detection platform', 'experience', 'human study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interstitial', 'macromolecule', 'multimodality', 'neurovascular', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'reconstruction', 'shared memory', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,124746
"Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging/Spectroscopy System For Robotic Cancer Surgery Guidance PROJECT SUMMARY In this competitive renewal for R01 CA187427, we will continue to advance label-free Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIm) to enhance the functionality of the widely-used da Vinci Surgical platform with an emphasis on Trans-Oral-Robotic-Surgery (TORS). UC Davis has pioneered the intra-operative use of FLIm and our partner, Intuitive Surgical, is the global leader in robotic-assisted surgery. To date, we have demonstrated a) the synergetic integration of a point-scanning FLIm device with the da Vinci Surgical System (first-of-its-kind); b) the potential of this approach to improve surgical decision-making during TORS without modifying conventional clinical protocols; and c) the utility of FLIM-derived parameters detecting biochemical and metabolic characteristics to distinguish oral and oropharyngeal cancer in real-time from surrounding normal tissue in patients in-situ.. We also developed innovative methods for real-time dynamic augmentation of imaging parameters on the surgical field of view. Capitalizing on the major accomplishments and knowledge gained under the current R01, the overarching objective of this renewal application is to 1) demonstrate FLIm’s diagnostic value in prospective studies by accounting for biological/experimental variables identified as critical under the current R01 and leveraging pre-operative imaging and clinical information and 2) enhance the visualization of FLIm-based classifiers on the surgeon console for real-time intraoperative feedback. To accomplish our overall objective, we propose three specific aims: Aim 1. Expand the FLIm database and develop tissue-type classifiers (retrospective analysis) accounting for biological variables (e.g., patient age/sex, tumor origin/location) and experimental situations (e.g., epithelial surface vs deep margins, tumors of an unknown primary) and the pre- operative imaging (CT, PET) features used in surgical planning. Aim 2. Develop, validate and perform regulatory activities for enhanced FLIm data visualization in support of prospective clinical studies. Aim 3. Validate FLIm as a means of real-time intraoperative TORS guidance in a prospective study analysis. In summary, this study will demonstrate the clinical feasibility and utility of FLIm for intraoperative real-time assessment of oral and oropharyngeal cancer surgical margins. The acquired FLIm parameter database will enable subsequent large clinical trials for automated tissue classification and diagnostic prediction. While the focus of this application is on TORS surgeries, the label-free FLIm-based tissue assessment, characterized by simple, fast and flexible data acquisition and display, can be broadly applied to other procedures as the da Vinci Surgical System is used in a wide range of tumor surgeries including urologic, colorectal, gynecologic, and thoracic cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optimal cancer and functional outcomes from surgical treatment of head and neck cancer requires the surgeon to have the ability to intraoperatively distinguish neoplastic disease from adjacent normal tissue. Our novel optical imaging FLIm technique, coupled to the da Vinci surgical system, captures and analyzes tissue autofluorescence to identify distinct tissue types and display this information onto the surgeon’s field of view during trans-oral- robotic surgery (TORS). This enables a more accurate and optimal cancer removal while preserving adjacent normal tissue and function. The successful validation of FLIm, with the sophisticated incorporation of head and neck cancer patient and radiology data to improve the tissue classifier, will allow for more cures with less long- term side effects and will be easily extended to other robotic and endoscopic procedures, thus advancing innovation well beyond TORS.",Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging/Spectroscopy System For Robotic Cancer Surgery Guidance,10211948,R01CA187427,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cauterize', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Epithelial', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Hemostatic function', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'In Situ', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Medical Records', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Risk Management', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urologic Cancer', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cancer surgery', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'functional outcomes', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'image registration', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'robotic system', 'sex', 'side effect', 'solid state', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'surgery outcome', 'symposium', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,633669
"Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation Project summary Computational multi-scale modeling is a growing area of research that aims to link whole slide images and radiographic iamges with multi-omics molecular profiles of the same patients. Multi-scale modeling has shown its potential through its ability to predict clinical outcomes e.g. prognosis, and through predicting actionable molecular properties of tumors, e.g. the activity of EGFR, a major drug target in many cancers. Current applications are limited to study associations between imaging and molecular data, and predicting long term outcomes. No actionable information can be gained from multi-scale biomarkers yet. We propose to develop a multi-scale modeling framework to support treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation for patients with brain tumors, focusing on the most aggressive subtype of glioma, IDH wild-type high grade glioma. In Aim 1, we will develop informatics algorithms that integrate multi-scale data for treatment response. We will use our expertise in data fusion and develop novel approaches to integrate multi- scale data to predict first line treatment response. In Aim 2, we will develop algorithms that allow combining multi-scale data at diagnosis with multi-modal MR imaging data during treatment follow-up. We will focus on predicting treatment response and progression and whether we can predict these events earlier than radiologists can. In Aim 3, we will develop algorithms that use the multi-scale data to predict drug target activities and also suggest novel drugs for patients that become resistant to first line treatment. We will use a mixture of publicly available glioma multi-scale data sets totaling more than 1000 patients, and also 1600 retrospective and 150 prospective brain tumor patients from Stanford Medical Center. Combining these complementary data sources in a multi-scale framework for data fusion can have profound contributions toward predicting treatment outcomes by uncovering unknown synergies and relationships. More specifically, developing computational models integrating quantitative image features and molecular data to develop multi-scale signatures, holds the potential to translate in benefit to brain tumor patients by investigating biomarkers that accurately predict treatment response. Readily, because whole slide images and radiographic imaging is part of the routine diagnostic work-up of cancer patients and molecular data of brain tumors is increasingly being used in clinical workflows, therefore if reliable multi-scale signatures can be found reflecting treatment response, translation to clinical applications is feasible, including optimizing recruitment for clinical trials. Narrative We propose a multi-scale framework for treatment allocation, treatment follow-up and treatment monitoring to provide precision medicine for brain tumor patients. We will develop algorithms integrating clinical, molecular and imaging data for therapeutic purposes. We will focus on the development of multi-scale biomarkers that are predictive of treatment response, suggest the use of novel drugs and help during treatment monitoring.","Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation",10184938,R01CA260271,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Repair Enzymes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Link', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer site', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data fusion', 'digital pathology', 'epigenetic silencing', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'methylation pattern', 'molecular imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'multiscale data', 'mutational status', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'pathology imaging', 'patient biomarkers', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'response', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'synergism', 'temozolomide', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,612041
"Deep learning for renal tumor characterization Our long-term objective is to develop deep learning techniques capable of predicting characteristics and treatment response or response to surveillance to assist clinical decision- making in renal tumors that are potential candidates for ablation therapy, biopsy, active surveillance or surgical resection. An increasing number of renal tumors are being diagnosed, due in part to incidental detection from the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. Although partial nephrectomy is still considered the primary treatment for small renal masses, percutaneous ablation is increasingly performed as a therapeutic, nephron-sparing approach. One challenge for interventional radiologists and urologists who manage these patients is selection for therapy, since the average rate of progression is slow for small renal tumors and metastasis rarely occurs. A technique that could distinguish indolent tumors from those will progress based on data from the imaging methods used to detect and delineate renal masses would enable early triage to observation versus invasive treatment. Deep learning, a type of machine learning technique which takes raw images as input, and applies many layers of transformations to calculate an output signal, has already led to breakthroughs in other areas of image recognition, and is increasingly used for medical image analysis. However, its application in the field of interventional radiology is currently limited. Furthermore, no study in the literature has applied deep learning to kidney lesion segmentation and characteristics/outcome prediction. In this project, we propose to develop novel deep learning architectures based on routine MR imaging that allow for accurate renal mass segmentation and prediction of characteristics and outcome in renal tumors. Using data from four independent cohorts, we will use our deep learning architectures to predict (1) benign versus malignant histology (2) growth rate in stage 1a renal cell carcinoma (3) SSIGN score in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and (4) clinical endpoints. We will integrate segmentation and classification into one net that suitable for clinical application. In addition, we will compare results with those of experts and traditional machine learning approaches. The inability to determine aggressiveness of renal tumors based on pretreatment imaging makes it challenging for urologists or interventional radiologists to select appropriate patients for active surveillance versus therapy with nephrectomy or ablation. Our research project uses deep learning to distinguish renal mass from normal tissue and predict characteristics, treatment response or response to surveillance in renal tumors. By using a multi-institutional patient cohort and conventional MR imaging sequences, we will demonstrate the generalizability and broad applicability of our algorithm. Our models have the potential to help guide clinical management of patients with renal tumors.",Deep learning for renal tumor characterization,10116348,R03CA249554,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clear cell renal cell carcinoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dropout', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Kidney', 'Modeling', 'Nephrectomy', 'Nephrons', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal Mass', 'Research Project Grants', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Urologist', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'random forest', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R03,2021,80500
"Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer Project Summary. The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven, medical imaging platform that utilizes computed tomography (CT) imaging to identify the presence of extranodal extension (ENE) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is a debilitating disease with significant patient-related morbidity related to the disease itself and its management, which is complex and consists of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A key factor in determining proper HNSCC management is the presence of ENE, which occurs when tumor infiltrates through the capsule of an involved lymph node into the surrounding tissue. ENE is both an important prognostic factor and an indication for adjuvant treatment escalation with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation following surgery. This “trimodality therapy” is problematic, as it is associated with increased treatment-related morbidity and healthcare costs, but no improvement in disease control compared to upfront chemoradiation alone. The challenge is that ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE identification has proven unreliable for even expert diagnosticians, leading to high rates of trimodality therapy and suboptimal treatment outcomes. In HNSCC management there is a critical need for improved pretreatment ENE identification to 1) select appropriate patients for surgery to avoid the excess morbidity and costs of trimodality therapy, 2) risk-stratify patients optimally, and 3) select appropriate patients for treatment de-escalation or intensification clinical trials. In recent years, Deep learning, a subtype of machine learning, under the umbrella of AI, has generated breakthroughs in computerized medical image analysis, at times outperforming human experts and discovering patterns hidden to the naked eye. While AI is poised to transform the fields of cancer imaging and personalized cancer care, there remain significant barriers to clinical implementation. The hypothesis of this project is that AI can be used to successfully identify HNSCC ENE on pretreatment imaging in retrospective and prospective patient cohorts and to develop a platform for lymph node auto-segmentation that will promote clinical utility of the platform. This hypothesis will be tested by rigorous optimization and evaluation of a deep learning ENE identification platform. Specifically, the platform will be validated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory performance on two heterogeneous retrospective datasets and two prospective cohorts derived from institutional and national Phase II clinical trials for HNSCC patients. The platform will then be directly compared with head and neck radiologists to determine if radiologist performance can be augmented with AI. In parallel, AI will be utilized to develop an auto-segmentation platform for tumor and lymph nodes, which will 1) improve the platform's clinical impact and 2) provide a valuable tool for treatment planning and future imaging-based research for HNSCC patients. 1 Project Narrative Identification of extranodal extension (ENE) for head and neck cancer in the pretreatment setting would be extremely useful in selecting the optimal treatment strategy for patients. Currently, ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE prediction has proven unreliable for expert diagnosticians. This project uses artificial intelligence to identify ENE pretreatment on Computed Tomography, with the goal of developing a clinically usable tool to help patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancers and their physicians choose the most effective treatment strategy that minimizes the risk of side effects.","Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer",10105483,K08DE030216,"['Adjuvant', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Extranodal', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck Dissection', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prospective cohort', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'capsule', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'heuristics', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient stratification', 'personalized cancer care', 'phase II trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'risk minimization', 'risk stratification', 'side effect', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIDCR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,168240
"Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and a major public health crisis, currently affecting over 5.8 million Americans and expected to rise as the population ages. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can identify the hallmark proteinopathies of AD, including amyloid protein plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (composed primarily of tau protein) accumulating in the brain. While there is evident need for more PET neuroimaging, for example, to elucidate the sequence of amyloid and tau deposition in preclinical AD, its increased utility in longitudinal imaging studies with large study populations is limited by recruitment and cost. In particular, making multiple visits to the scanning site will be difficult for participants living far away, and the high cost of injected radiotracers will limit the scalability of PET studies.  In this project we propose using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for imaging AD. Our specific aims are (1) to validate the diagnostic value of the CNNs in actual ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau imaging sessions, with the injected dose as low as 1% of the original, and with actual ultra-low-dose data, to validate simulations for use in subsequent aims and future studies; (2) to apply the ultra-low-dose CNN to data collected on other PET systems and tracers, in order to demonstrate the CNN’s generalizability; and (3) to evaluate the value of deep learning-aided ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for tracking cognitive decline in a preclinical AD population.  The innovation of this work lies in using multimodal imaging in addition to advanced machine learning techniques to enable acquisition of diagnostic-level PET images at extremely low dose levels. Performing actual ultra-low-dose PET acquisitions is also highly novel in itself. The outcome of this proposal is removing the limiting factors to large-scale clinical longitudinal imaging, shortening acquisitions spanning multiple days and visits to several hours in one visit with a successive ultra-low-dose and full-dose dual-tracer scan protocol. Significant dose reduction can also be achieved, allowing for more frequent amyloid/tau PET scanning. This flexibility will not only increase the utility of PET, aid longitudinal studies in dementia, but enable future comprehensive imaging of multiple PET-based biomarkers as these tracers are being developed. Project Narrative  More frequent PET scans can be used for dementia, a major cause of deaths in the United States, to understand the pathogenesis of the brain proteinopathies involved, to identify at-risk individuals, and to provide outcome markers for clinical trials of anti-amyloid/tau therapies; but recruitment for studies, cost, and radiation dose to the scanned participant are critical factors limiting its use. This work aims to train versatile deep learning-based neural networks which can produce diagnostic-level images from ultra-low-dose (as low as 1%) amyloid and tau PET acquisitions. Our study will provide flexibility in recruitment (running ultra-low-dose and full-dose scans in succession for dual-tracer studies), reduce the cost for radiotracer use, and reduce the dose in scanned participants, a “win-win” for researchers and patients.",Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease,10214874,K99AG068310,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Drowning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radioactivity', 'Reading', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'clinical application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'imaging agent', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'longitudinal positron emission tomography', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'radiotracer', 'recruit', 'research study', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'simulation', 'study population', 'tau Proteins', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,100863
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,10114224,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'PSA level', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,414490
"New treatment monitoring biomarkers for brain tumors using multiparametric MRI with machine learning Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate novel imaging biomarker(s) that use multiparameter MRI methods to identify the true spatial extent of glial brain tumors. The standard RANO (response assessment in neuro-oncology) criteria define tumor extent as the region of bright signal on post-contrast agent T1w (T1+C) images, termed the contrast enhancing lesion (CEL), along with the peritumoral bright signal on T2w FLAIR images, referred to as non-enhancing lesion (NEL). Yet, the CEL reflects the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to contrast agent and can appear the same for both tumor and treatment effect. Likewise, though NEL likely contains tumor, current imaging cannot distinguish tumor from edema. These difficulties result in the inability of current anatomical MRI methods to determine the true spatial extent of glial tumors, a serious limitation for treatment management of brain tumor patients. We and others have shown that advanced MRI methods, including perfusion and diffusion MRI, are useful for assessing tumor grade, predicting outcomes, or distinguishing tumor from treatment effect. Yet, almost exclusively, the approach has been to extract mean values of a single physiological parameter from predetermined tumor regions of interest and then measure their correlation with the desired clinical index. Although this approach has been useful for initial biomarker development, it underutilizes the rich multiparameter and spatial information available, thus motivating the current study. First, two multiparameter MRI biomarkers will be developed to identify enhancing and infiltrating tumor burden. Then, they will be evaluated individually and in combination to assess the total tumor burden in comparison with the standard volumetric metrics in current use. The development and testing of these biomarkers will be accomplished in several independent steps outlined by the proposed aims. First (Aim 1), we propose to develop an MRI biomarker that gives the voxelwise probability of enhancing tumor burden within CEL, with early results showing the ability to distinguish tumor from treatment effect. Next, we will develop a multiparameter biomarker capable of identifying infiltrating tumor within NEL (Aim 2). These efforts leverage our previous results using artificial intelligence, recent advances in machine learning, and our unique brain tumor tissue bank with hundreds of biopsy samples spatially matched to imaging. Finally (Aim 3), the spatial extent of tumor burden within CEL and NEL will be tested in their ability to distinguish pseudo-progression/response from true progression/response, which is a primary question that confounds treatment management today. In summary, multiparameter advanced MRI biomarkers of enhancing and infiltrative brain tumor have the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how treatment is managed, ultimately resulting in improved outcomes. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel multiparametric MRI biomarkers that precisely identify regions of brain tumor within areas of contrast-enhancement and peritumoral edema, which cannot be identified using standard MRI. Powered by recent advances in machine learning, our approach has the potential to cause a fundamental shift in the treatment management of patients with brain tumors.",New treatment monitoring biomarkers for brain tumors using multiparametric MRI with machine learning,10220248,R01CA255123,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Edema', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Excision', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Lesion', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Markers', 'Work', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker development', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'chemoradiation', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'molecular marker', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'tumor']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2021,547655
"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,10190850,R01CA237269,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Beds', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Consultations', 'Curiosities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Generations', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individuality', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'negative affect', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,490133
"Virtual Biopsy with Tissue-level Accuracy in Glioma Project Summary This is a Bioengineering Research Grant (BRG) proposal in response to PAR-19-158 to further develop and validate a non-invasive panel of the most critical glioma molecular markers (IDH, 1p/19q, MGMT) using standard clinical MRI T2-weighted images and deep learning, and extend the performance to tissue-level accuracies. Currently, the only reliable way of obtaining molecular marker status is through direct tissue sampling of the tumor, requiring either a craniotomy and stereotactic biopsy or a large open surgical resection. Noninvasive determination of molecular markers with tissue-level accuracy would be transformational in the management of gliomas, reducing or eliminating the risks and costs associated with a neurosurgical procedure, accelerating the time to definitive treatment, improving patient experience and ultimately patient outcomes and survival time. Artificial intelligence such as deep learning has emerged as a powerful method for classification of imaging data that can exceed human performance. Preliminary work using our novel voxel-wise classification-segmentation approach with the NIH/NCI TCIA glioma database has outperformed any prior noninvasive methods for determination of IDH, 1p/19q, and MGMT methylation, achieving accuracies of 97%, 93%, and 95%, respectively. The approach however, needs to be validated beyond the TCIA and accuracies need to be extended in order to achieve tissue level performance. This will be accomplished by using our top-performing voxel-wise classification framework, leveraging marker-specific targeted sample sizes, and gaining a final boost from deep-learning artifact correction networks. In Aim 1 we will curate a database of over 2000 gliomas including 500 subjects from our institution, 1200 subjects from our external collaborators, and over 300 subjects from the TCIA. We will train our voxel-wise deep learning classifiers to determine molecular status based on clinical T2-weighted MR images with target accuracies of 97%. In Aim 2 we will rigorously evaluate the motion and noise sensitivity of the networks and create an artifact correction network with the goals of 1) recovering accuracies in the setting of large amounts of motion/noise and 2) further boosting accuracy to tissue-level performance even in the absence of visible artifact. In Aim 3 we will deploy a complete end-to-end clinical workflow and evaluate real-world live performance of the AI tool on 300 prospectively acquired brain tumor cases and 300 subjects from our external collaborators. The AI tool will be made available for deployment at other medical centers. The developed framework can also be extended to additional markers in a straightforward fashion. In summary, this BRG proposal will further develop, refine and validate a non-invasive MRI-based method for determining the most critical glioma molecular markers rivaling tissue-level accuracies to significantly reduce and in many cases eliminate the need for stereotactic biopsy. Project Narrative Knowledge of molecular status for a variety of markers in gliomas has moved to the forefront in clinical decision- making. This requires direct tissue sampling either from an invasive brain biopsy or open surgical resection. In this Bioengineering Research Grant proposal in response to PAR-19-158, we will develop and validate a non- invasive method to determine a panel of the most critical molecular markers (IDH, 1p/19q and MGMT methylation) with near tissue-level accuracies using routine T2-weighted (T2w) MR images and deep learning algorithms to significantly reduce and in many cases eliminate the need for stereotactic biopsy in glioma.",Virtual Biopsy with Tissue-level Accuracy in Glioma,10226632,R01CA260705,"['19q', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Excision', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hyperacusis', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'MGMT gene', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning classifier', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'motion sensitivity', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'response', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,655597
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult brain tumor, with grim prognosis and heterogeneous molecular and imaging profiles. Although the currently applicable treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have expanded during the last 20 years, there is no substantial improvement in the OS rates. The major obstacle in treating GBM patients is the heterogeneity of their molecular landscape. Determination of molecular targets requires ex vivo postoperative tissue analyses, which are limited in assessing the tumor's spatial heterogeneity (sampling error due to single sample histopathological and molecular analysis) and temporal heterogeneity (not possible to continuously assess the molecular transformation of the tumor during treatment). Herein we propose to develop quantitative imaging phenomic (QIP) markers of a range of mutations of interest in GB. We will build on prior work on EGFR, IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation QIP signatures, and develop an extensive panel of imaging signatures of 10 gene mutations, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, using machine learning methods applied to relatively routine clinical mpMRI (standard plus diffusion tensor and perfusion protocols). Availability of such biomarkers can contribute to non-invasive i) patient stratification into appropriate treatments, ii) measurement of individual molecular characteristics. In particular, we propose to carry out the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To develop the enabling methodologies for constructing Quantitative Imaging Phenomic signatures of GB mutations Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Establish QIP signatures of 10 mutations of interest in gliomas, plus MGMT promoter status, using next generation sequencing (NGS). We will use 709 datasets. Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Characterize the molecular heterogeneity of GB using QIP signatures, leveraging the NGS samples of SA1, as well as a new sample that we will genotype, adding to a total of 600 tumor samples obtained from 4 different locations per patient from 150 patients. The first 150 tissue samples are already analyzed as part of ongoing work. Specific Aim 4 (SA4): Integrate our methods into the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk), in order to allow easy access to them by users This project will investigate the relationship between imaging characteristics of glioblastoma and its underlying genetic mutations/variants. As such, it aims to develop a number of imaging signatures of mutations that are important in GBM, using 1,159 (709 patients plus an additional 450 tissue samples of 150 of these patients obtained from different locations in the tumor) analyzed via next generation sequencing. The primary motivation of this work is to develop the imaging analytics methodologies and associated biomarkers that will allow us to evaluate the spatial, temporal and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma, thereby assisting in patient stratification and treatment.",Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning,10067573,R01NS042645,"['Adult', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiogenomics', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'genetic signature', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'phenomics', 'predictive signature', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'receptor', 'routine imaging', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,642578
"Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Project Summary Organ motion is a predominant limiting factor for the maximum exploitation of modern radiation therapy (RT). Adverse influence of the organ motion is aggravated in hypofractionated treatment because of protracted dose delivery. Current image guided RT often relies on the use of implanted fiducial markers (FMs) for online/offline target localization, which is invasive and costly, and introduces possible bleeding, infection and discomfort of the patient. In this project, we harness the enormous potential of deep learning and investigate a novel markerless localization strategy by combined use of a pre-trained deep learning model and kV X-ray projection or cone beam CT images. We hypothesize that incorporation of deep layers of image information allows us to visualize otherwise invisible target in real-time and greatly reduce the uncertainties in beam targeting. Specific aims of the project are to: (1) Develop a DL-based tumor target localization framework for image guided RT (IGRT); (2) Apply the DL-based strategy to localize prostate target on 2D kV X-ray projection and 3D CBCT images; and (3) Evaluate the potential clinical impact of the DL strategy for pancreatic IGRT. This study brings up, for the first time, highly accurate markerless target localization based on deep learning and provides a clinically sensible solution for IGRT of prostate and pancreas cancers or other types of cancers. Successful completion of this investigation will significantly advance the current beam targeting technique and provide radiation oncology discipline a powerful way to safely and reliably escalate the radiation dose for precision RT. Given its significant promise to optimally cater for inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, the study should lead to substantial improvement in patient care and enables us to utilize maximally the technical capability of modern RT such as IMRT and VMAT. Given the dose responsive nature of various cancers and that the proposed method requires no hardware modification, this research should lead to a widespread impact on the management of neoplasmic diseases affected by organ motion. Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Project Narrative This project is aimed at establishing a deep learning-based image guidance strategy for motion management in prostate and pancreas radiation therapy.

"Copper-mediated Radiofluorination: from Proof-of-Concept to Clinical Impact Abstract: Radiotracers containing [18F]-labeled electron-rich aromatic rings are among the most highly sought- after PET imaging agents but have been historically challenging to synthesize. Recent efforts have sought to improve the late-stage labeling of (hetero)arenes with [18F]fluoride. In particular, transition metal-mediated reactions using high molar activity [18F]fluoride have changed the way radiochemists form C–18F bonds, and copper-mediated radiofluorination (CMRF) has proven one of the most versatile of approaches. In the previous award, we reported 10 new CMRF reactions, validated them for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and used them to synthesize FDA-approved clinical doses. However, despite many successes, several key challenges remain for the widespread clinical application of CMRF: (a) many important organic scaffolds are incompatible with existing CMRF processes, (b) yields of automated CMRF methods are typically moderate and thus unsuitable for commercial distribution, and (c) disposable cassette technologies are not available for CMRF on automated radiosynthesizers, limiting radiotracer production for routine clinical use. All of these challenges will be addressed in this renewal proposal. The overall objective is to develop robust methods for clinical production of diverse PET radiotracers. Our central hypothesis is that CMRF is uniquely positioned to enable us to achieve this goal. The proposed research will identify new reactions to radiofluorinate scaffolds that are incompatible with existing CMRF (Aim 1), use cutting edge machine learning techniques to improve automated CMRF yields (Aim 2), and develop cassette technologies for reliable GMP production of clinical radiotracers using CMRF (Aim 3). The research is significant because it entails development of methods for radiolabeling bioactive molecules containing functionality that is incompatible (or low yielding) with existing CMRF (heterocycles like pyridine and morpholine, drug molecules like GW405833), as well as optimized automated methods and cassettes for radiotracers that have been challenging to access for decades (e.g. [18F]FDOPA). The viability of the proposed efforts is supported by extensive preliminary results that provide groundwork for the exciting new research directions. Our team has been collaborating for 7 years and our expertise in transition metal catalysis (Sanford), radiochemistry (Scott), and machine learning (Doyle) uniquely positions us to accomplish the proposed research. The project goals will be accomplished through a variety of innovations including: (1) developing methods for labeling challenging electron-rich (hetero)arenes from new precursors (C–H bonds, aryl halides), (2) the first application of machine learning to radiochemistry, and (3) development of automated cassettes for conducting CMRF using the newest generation of radiosynthesizers designed for plug-and-play production. Overall, this project will deliver multiple new methods for synthesizing 18F-labeled radiotracers that are inaccessible using existing methods, and validated clinical syntheses of important radiotracers. All of these deliverables will expand the utility of PET imaging for the detection, treatment, and prevention of disease. Project Narrative: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a non-invasive molecular imaging technique that allows real-time in vivo monitoring of physiological processes via administration of a radiotracer (a molecule tagged with a PET radioisotope) to a patient. Currently, PET imaging finds application in drug discovery, disease diagnosis and monitoring, and personalized medicine. Approximately 2 million PET scans are conducted annually, and there is significant room for further growth. However, the impact of PET cannot be fully realized without both new synthetic methods for the assembly of radiotracers as well as the translation of these synthesis methods to routine clinical production. The overall objective of our research is to develop new chemistry for preparing currently inaccessible PET radiotracers, use machine learning techniques to optimize production yields with these new methods, and introduce automated cassette technology that will allow easy and confident use of this new chemistry to produce PET radiotracers for clinical trials and routine standard of care.",Copper-mediated Radiofluorination: from Proof-of-Concept to Clinical Impact,10209444,R01EB021155,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Catalysis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Copper', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Electrons', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorides', 'Fluorine', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Label', 'Levodopa', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nuclear', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Radiochemistry', 'Radioisotopes', 'Radiolabeled', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Side', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transition Elements', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'aryl halide', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder prevention', 'drug discovery', 'imaging agent', 'imaging detection', 'improved', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'molecular imaging', 'morpholine', 'neural network', 'personalized medicine', 'preclinical imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'pyridine', 'radiotracer', 'random forest', 'scaffold', 'standard of care', 'success']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,377343
"Integrative Prediction of Therapeutic Response in T-cell Lymphoma by Omic and Spatial Modeling ABSTRACT The tumor ecosystem plays a critical role in tumor development, progression and therapeutic response. Previous studies have utilized dissociative and single-cell omics technologies to profile the tumor ecosystem, specifically to understand therapeutic resistance and identify predictive biomarkers for precision cancer medicine. Yet, very few of these biomarkers have adequate performance characteristics for adoption in clinical practice. We hypothesize that a fundamental facet of the tumor ecosystem, i.e., the spatial organization of cells, which encodes key information involving paracrine and juxtracrine interactions that drive “neighborhood- level” biology, can further inform predictive models. Recent technological breakthroughs in highly multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomics offer an unprecedented opportunity to delineate the therapeutic consequences of spatial relationships within clinical tumor samples. Quantitative spatial features can provide independent valuable information, which is unlikely to be captured by clinical, genetic and bulk-transcriptional predictors. Hence, we propose to integrate highly multiplexed imaging data with omic approaches to delineate mechanisms of resistance and build predictive models of response for patients with T-cell lymphoma, who have a desperate unmet clinical need. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will build automated computational tools to robustly quantify spatial features from highly multiplexed imaging data and integrate it with exome and RNA- Seq. I will utilize >100 primary specimens collected pre-, on- and after-treatment with the PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib to nominate mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance. In Aim 2 (K99 phase), I will build an integrated machine-learning model to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from duvelisib and evaluate the impact of spatial features towards model performance. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will validate the model in an independent cohort and extend to samples from patients treated with additional agents, to identify consistent and parsimonious signatures of spatial features that could be developed for broader use. My extensive background in computational biology and experimental biology puts me in a unique position to accomplish this proposal. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators (Drs. David Weinstock, Peter Sorger, Jon Aster, Allon Klein, Peter Park, and Steven Horwitz) with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. I will acquire new skills in (1) computational analysis of highly multiplexed imaging to model molecular and spatial information, (2) data integration methods to delineate regulatory programs for designing effective drug combinations and (3) analysis of predictive biomarkers in clinical trial samples from clinical trials. Together with institutional support from Dana Farber Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital to transition into an independent position and establish an independent, data science-driven, translational research program. PROJECT NARRATIVE T-cell lymphomas (TCLs) are highly diverse and patients with relapsed disease have a dismal prognosis. The PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib induces response in 60% of patients with TCL through tumor cell-intrinsic and immunomodulatory mechanisms, but nearly all responders ultimately develop resistance. We hypothesize that the integration of spatial data, including neighborhood analyses to identify para- and juxtacrine interactions, with genetic and transcriptional alterations will inform predictive models for duvelisib response and nominate mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance that can aid therapeutic selection and broadly applied across tumor types.",Integrative Prediction of Therapeutic Response in T-cell Lymphoma by Omic and Spatial Modeling,10115190,K99CA256497,"['1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Immune', 'JAK1 gene', 'JAK2 gene', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Non-Malignant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcription Alteration', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'liquid crystal polymer', 'mRNA Expression', 'molecular modeling', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'paracrine', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell technology', 'skills', 'spatial integration', 'spatial relationship', 'spectrograph', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support vector machine', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational research program', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2021,136080
"Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning Project Summary Positron-emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that allows clinicians and researchers to study the physiological or pathological processes of the human body, and in particular the brain via the use of specific tracers. For brain PET imaging, patient head movement during scanning presents a challenge for accurate PET image reconstruction and subsequent quantitative analysis. Problems due to head motion are exacerbated by the long duration of the scans, with scan times commonly over one hour. Furthermore, some PET studies specifically involve subjects that either have trouble staying still due to psychological variations, e.g. patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, or psychological variations, e.g. subjects with anxiety disorders, or are required to participate in tasks that involve movement, e.g. smoking cigarettes while scanning. In brain scans, the average head motion can vary from 7 mm in clinical scans to triple this amount for longer research scans. Quantitatively, a 5 mm head motion can produce biases of up to ~35% in regional intensities and ∼15% in volume of distribution estimates, which could much larger than the difference observed in regional intensities or binding potential that distinguish different demographic groups being studied. The ability to track and correct head motion, therefore, would be of high utility in both clinical and research PET studies. In the past, many motion correction methods have been proposed. However, except for hardware-based approaches, there has been no method that can track frequent head motion on-the-fly during the PET acquisition. Hardware-based approaches are not readily available for clinical translation or used by other research facilities due to highly-customized software/hardware setup. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a data-driven methodology using deep learning to track and estimate rigid head motion using PET raw data, and incorporate both tracer type and time as conditional variables into this deep neural network design in order to handle diverse PET tracer types and their dynamic behavior. Overall, these solutions will provide for a data-driven motion estimation methodology to improve the quality of PET imaging. Specifically, we will start with the development and testing of our methodology for rigid head motion estimation using single-tracer PET raw data. Then we will perform evaluation of our multi-tracer motion estimation methodology applied to real PET data with a diverse range of tracers. Finally, in the exploratory phase, we will integrate time-of-flight information into deep learning-based motion prediction. The significance of this proposal is that it will allow for improved quality of PET imaging in real time and potentially allow for its use in clinical PET systems that do not have special motion tracking hardware. This work will serve as a first step towards developing data-driven motion estimation algorithms for full body PET imaging. The innovation lies in the development of what is a data-driven solution to the problem of real time motion estimation. Project Narrative Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain is a highly useful tool for biomedical research and clinical practice. Head motion during scanning degrades PET image quality and introduces image artifacts. We propose to develop new data-driven methods, based on PET raw data, to estimate head motion using deep learning, which can be used for real time motion estimation in PET imaging.",Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning,10144432,R21EB028954,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neural network', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'research facility', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,209375
"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact.

"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",10129958,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'statistical learning', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,350335
"Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers Superficially spreading types of skin cancers such as lentigo maligna melanomas (LMMs) and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) occur mostly on older patients, with diffuse sub-clinical sub-surface spread over large areas and with poorly defined margins that are difficult to detect. To treat these cancers, dermatologists rou- tinely perform a large number of mapping biopsies to determine the spread and margins, followed by surgical excision with wide ""safety"" margins. Not surprisingly, such a ""blind"" approach results in under-sampling of the margins, over-sampling of normal skin, too many false positives and false negatives, and too much loss of normal skin tissue. What may help address this problem is reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging to noninvasively delineate margins, directly on patients. RCM imaging detects skin cancers in vivo with sensitivity of 85-95% and specificity 80-70%. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted reim- bursement codes for RCM imaging of skin. RCM imaging is now being increasingly used to noninvasively guide diagnosis, sparing patients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. While the two-decade effort leading to the granting of these codes was focused on imaging-guided diagnosis, emerging applications are in imaging to guide therapy. We propose to create an approach called RCM video-mosaicking, to noninvasively map skin cancer margins over large areas on patients, with increased sampling, accuracy and sparing of nor- mal tissue. The innovation will be in designing a highly robust (against tissue warping and motion artifacts) and high speed (real-time, seconds) approach for RCM video-mosaicking: we will develop an optical flow ap- proach with a novel hybrid 3-stage deep learning network comprising of 8 parameters that will model global and local rigid and non-rigid tissue motion dynamics, learn and adapt to variable tissue and speckle noise con- ditions in patients, and predict and automatically detect motion blur artifacts. As required by PAR-18-009, our academic-industrial partnership will deliver RCM video-mosaicking to clinicians for real-time implementation at the bedside (translational novelty). Our proposed application is for guiding surgical excision, but the approach will have wider impact, for guiding new and emerging less invasive non-surgical treatments for superficial skin cancers. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated RCM video-mosaicking with real-time speed (125 millisec- onds per frame, 8 frames per second), and registration errors of 1.02 ± 1.3 pixels relative to field-of-view of 1000 x 1000 pixels. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a real-time and robust RCM video-mosaicking ap- proach and incorporate into a handheld confocal microscope for use at the bedside, (2) to test the approach for image quality and clinical acceptability, and (3) to prospectively test on 100 patients, with pre-surgical video- mosaicking of LMM margins and superficial NMSC margins, followed by validation against post-surgical pa- thology. We are a highly synergistic team from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern Uni- versity, and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.), with a 13-year record of collaboration. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging can noninvasively diagnose skin cancers, and spare patients from biopsies of benign skin conditions. We propose to develop an approach to noninvasively delineate skin cancer margins, to help guide less invasive surgery, and help more accurately and completely remove cancer while preserving more of the surrounding normal skin.",Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers,10203886,R01CA240771,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Dermatologist', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Excision', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Grant', 'Hutchinson&apos', 's Melanotic Freckle', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Video Microscopy', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'blind', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'design', 'expectation', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'older patient', 'preservation', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'vector']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,641977
"Image-based models of tumor-immune dynamics in glioblastoma ABSTRACT The use of immunotherapy to treat cancer continues to generate hope and excitement among those involved in cancer care and research. However, our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to immunotherapy, combined with our inability to identify early response or predict the responders, poses serious challenges in this field. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer. Clear evidence of tumor-immune environment heterogeneity across patients suggests that we will have to use an individualized approach in order to accurately assess patient tumor’s specific immune environment and the evolution of these complex systems. We propose to use computational modeling and artificial intelligence to bridge the spatial scales of the cellular content comprising each MRI at the voxel level, but also to bridge the temporal scales. We will focus on the most cellular immune population in glioblastoma, microglia/macrophages, that constitute as much as 50% of the cellular content of tumor specimens. By fusing MRI with the biological heterogeneity found in image- localized biopsies through such radiomics approaches provides an opportunity to individualize our understanding of the the tumor-immune environment, broadly benefiting scientists across the fields of oncology and immunology. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of the tumor at every imaging time point, the radiomics maps can also be used to parameterize dynamic mechanistic models of tumor growth to allow for prediction of future dynamics. These spatio-temporal models allow us to test hypotheses about causal relationships between different cell types and microenvironmental factors, as well as to verify whether the radiomics maps provide early dynamic insights into tumor response that can impact clinical decision making. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to immunotherapy, combined with our inability to predict the responders, poses a serious challenge to advancing cancer care and research. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer. We propose here a novel strategy merging artificial intelligence and mechanistic modeling to reveal the spatial and temporal tumor-immune landscape within patients by connecting a unique resource of image-localized biopsies and clinical imaging for cohorts treated with standard and immunotherapies.",Image-based models of tumor-immune dynamics in glioblastoma,10107517,U01CA250481,"['Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Cancerous', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Edema', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer care', 'cell type', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cytotoxic', 'effective therapy', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macrophage', 'molecular phenotype', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'synergism', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2021,702579
"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Abstract Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with preferential delivery of 90Y microspheres to target lesions has shown promising response rates with limited toxicity in the treatment of hepatocellular (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. However, to achieve more durable responses, there is much room to improve/adapt the treatment to ensure that all lesions and lesion sub-regions receive adequate radiation delivery. While externally delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well suited for smaller solitary HCC, its application for larger or multifocal disease is challenged by the radiation tolerance of the normal liver parenchyma. A dosimetry guided combined approach that exploits complementary advantages of internal and external radiation delivery can be expected to improve treatment of HCC. To make this transition, however, prospective clinical trials establishing safety are needed. Furthermore, for routine clinic use, accurate and fast voxel-level dose estimation in internal radionuclide therapy, that lags behind external beam therapy dosimetry, is still needed. Our long-term goal is to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy with personalized dosimetry guided treatment. Our objective in this application is to demonstrate that it is possible to use 90Y imaging based absorbed dose estimates after SIRT to safely deliver external radiation to target regions (voxels) that are predicted to be underdosed and to develop deep learning based tools to make voxel-level internal dose estimation practical for routine clinic use. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a Phase 1 clinical trial in HCC patients where we will take the novel approach of using the 90Y PET/CT derived absorbed dose map after SIRT to deliver SBRT to tumor regions predicted to be underdosed based on previously established dose-response models. The primary objective of the trial is to obtain estimates of safety of combined SIRT+SBRT for future Phase II trial design. In parallel, in Aim 2, building on promising initial results we will develop novel deep learning based tools for 90Y PET/CT and SPECT/CT reconstruction, joint reconstruction-segmentation and scatter estimation under the low count-rate setting, typical for 90Y. These methods have a physics/mathematics foundation, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are included within the iterative reconstruction process, instead of post-reconstruction denoising. In Aim 3, we will develop a CNN for fast voxel-level dosimetry and combine with the CNNs of Aim 2 to develop an innovative end-to-end framework with unified dosimetry-task based training. At the end of this study, we will be ready to use the new deep learning tools in a Phase II trial to demonstrate enhanced efficacy with SIRT+SBRT compared with SIRT alone and advance towards our long- term goal. This will accelerate adoption of these next-generation tools in clinical practice and will have a significant positive impact because treatment based on patient specific dosimetry will substantially improve efficacy, compared with current standard practice in SIRT. Although we focus on 90Y SIRT, our tools will be applicable in radionuclide therapy in general, a rapidly advancing treatment option. Narrative We will perform a Phase I clinical trial where standard-of-care Y-90 microsphere radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma will be followed by external radiation to target regions that are predicted to be underdosed by Y-90, based on patient specific dosimetry. In parallel, we will develop and test voxel-level internal dosimetry tools using convolution neural networks to make such dosimetry-based planning accurate and fast for routine clinic use. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided combination radiation treatment approach is likely to substantially improve patient outcome compared to current standard practice of internal or external radiation only.",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,10206138,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Evaluable Disease', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver parenchyma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'dosimetry', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,657625
"Advanced Technologies - National Center for Image Guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) ABSTRACT: The intersection of healthcare and biomedical research is at an inflection point with the convergence of the digital revolution, advances in imaging, nanotechnology, big data science, and precision or personalized medicine. There is a wealth of meaningful, but complex information that could be extracted from imaging data but is not optimally utilized for patient care. Cancer care exemplifies the current challenges which include early detection, accurate distinction of pre- neoplastic and neoplastic lesions, prediction of tumor aggressiveness, determining infiltrative tumor margins during surgical treatment, tracking tumor evolution/ metastasis pattern, recurrence, and potential acquired resistance to treatments over time. Major strides have been made in the personalization of cancer therapies such as immunotherapy, but the availability of specific, relevant, and timely medical data and information is of critical importance to realizing the full potential of precision medicine. Nowhere is this more acutely evident than during interventions in the operating and procedure rooms. Novel methods of image guidance, data integration, information extraction, and knowledge transfer are needed to enable clinicians to fully leverage the information available, especially before, during and after invasive procedures. We are excited to re-submit a proposal for a new P41 biomedical resource center (BTRC) called Advanced Technologies for NCIGT(AT-NCIGT) with 3 TRDs, 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects, all of which aim to investigate develop and disseminate new technologies for image guided therapy (IGT). The 3 components are Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity for IGT, Deep Learning for IGT and Intraoperative devices for IGT. These new technologies alone and in combinations will allow for greater understanding of disease state, treatment guidance, integration/navigation and in-vivo monitoring of tissue responses and improve the precision of invasive procedures. Thus the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate, develop and disseminate novel technologies for extracting new tissue characteristics (technology research and development core TRD 1: Imaging cancer heterogeneity; analyze them and make them available through state-of-the-art algorithmic and data curation approaches (Deep Learning TRD 2); and enable precise tissue sampling surgical navigation and in-vivo tissue response through the results of novel Intraoperative devices (Intraoperative devices for IGT: TRD 3). In order to effectively disseminate all this new knowledge we have 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects and will share these novel tools through our established mechanisms, from current BTRC- National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT), which continues to be dedicated to the innovating for IGT into interventional radiology, surgery, radiation oncology, and procedure-based medicine. Project Narrative The Advanced Technologies-National Center for Image guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) is a research and technology center with the mission of advancing patient care, by developing novel innovative tools for image guided Therapy (IGT).

"Deep Learning Reconstruction for Improved TOF PET Using Histo-Image Partitioning Project Summary  Clinical and research applications of the PET imaging are rapidly expanding from ever improving diagnostic and treatment assessment applications to guidance of personalized treatments, ultra-low dose imaging, and even interventional imaging procedures. Supporting these developments, reconstruction tools that are able to reliably handle both typical and (ultra-)low count situations, imperfect data, and data from specialized imaging geometries, with fast (near real-time) reconstruction performance are of crucial importance. The overall goal of this project is to develop and investigate robust and efficacious Deep Learning (DL) reconstruction approaches addressing these needs. A unique and innovative feature of the proposed approaches (compared to alternative DL applications) is the utilization of list-mode data histogrammed into a very efficient histo-image format. TOF data partitioned into the histo-image format are characterized by strong local properties, thus perfectly fitting convolutional neural network formalism and making DL training and reconstruction directly from realistic clinical data (in size and character) highly feasible and practical.  The clinical utility of PET systems has significantly improved over the years thanks to advances in instrumentation, data corrections, and reconstruction approaches. Nevertheless, full utilization of their potential through robust and fast quantitative reconstruction remains a challenge especially for the cases of very low count data, such as in low-count temporal (motion and dynamic) frames, delayed studies, longitudinal low-dose studies, and studies using new isotopes with long half-life and low positron fraction rates (e.g. in 89Zr-labeled CAR-T cell imaging), as well as in specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage, for which exact, artifact-free, reconstruction does not exist. These are the situations for which the developed DL approaches promise great potential due to the demonstrated success of the DL networks to be trained for imperfect and very low count data without reliance on accurate data models. Furthermore, pre-trained networks can provide ultra- fast, near real-time, performance in practical use.  Specific Aim 1 will develop tools for DL PET reconstruction using histo-image partitioning along with procedures for training of the proposed DL approaches, including novel approaches advancing the state-of-the- art of DL reconstruction directly from acquired PET data. Specific Aim 2 is directed towards study and evaluation of the performance of the investigated DL approaches for whole-body and long axial FOV scanner data for the wide range of counts from applications such as typical FDG, low dose, delayed, low activity isotope scans, and ultra-short frames in motion correction and dynamic studies. Specific Aim 3 will develop and apply motion correction protocols involving the proposed DL reconstruction tools and test and study their efficacy for clinically realistic situations involving non-rigid lung and heart motions. And finally, Specific Aim 4 is dedicated to an application and study of the developed DL approaches to specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage. 1 Project Narrative  The major goal of this project is to improve the diagnostic, treatment guidance, and research utility of quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, through the development of robust, near real-time, deep-learning based reconstruction approaches allowing efficacious use of standard, low dose, and novel low activity imaging molecular bio-tracers. The proposed work is relevant to public health, since an improvement in the reconstructed images will lead to more accurate diagnosis of diseases and more accurate treatment guidance and monitoring of the response to therapy, while allowing for decreased patient radiation dose. It will also facilitate quantitatively reliable tools for research investigations with new radiotracers for PET tailored to specific diseases. 2",Deep Learning Reconstruction for Improved TOF PET Using Histo-Image Partitioning,10276952,R01EB031806,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Application procedure', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Breast', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Isotopes', 'Label', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cellular imaging', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'detector', 'disease diagnosis', 'efficacy evaluation', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning network', 'loss of function', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'proton therapy', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'solid state', 'statistics', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,620138
"Evaluation of treatment predictors reflecting beta-catenin activation in hepatocellular carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and its incidence is rising in both men and women in the United States. Anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) antibodies are now FDA approved for advanced HCC, however, as few as 20% of patients receiving these agents will show an objective response to therapy. Because immune-related adverse events are non-trivial, predictive biomarkers that can explain the variability in immunotherapy response are needed to optimize patient selection.  Several lines of research have recently converged to associate oncogenic activation of the Wnt/beta- catenin signaling pathway with tumor immune-evasion and poor clinical response to ICI therapy in HCC. In previous research, we found that HCC exhibiting high uptake of the positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging agent 18F- fluorocholine (FCH) often belonged to molecular tumor sub-types associated with beta-catenin activation and immune avoidance. Liquid biopsy based on targeted sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has also made it possible to identify patients who have tumors that harbor mutations associated with increased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.  This project comprises a phase 2 biomarker clinical trial to prospectively evaluate these specific embodiments of PET/CT and liquid biopsy as tools for detecting HCC recalcitrant to ICI therapy on the basis of beta-catenin activation. In addition to characterizing and comparing the predictive capabilities of FCH PET/CT and cfDNA mutation profiling based on phase 2 clinical endpoints, this project will utilize decision tree based machine learning to estimate the predictive performance of an integrative imaging-genomic biomarker while also further examining how tumor mutations are related to PET metabolic phenotype and immunotherapy response. Furthermore, because tumor 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake is incongruent with FCH uptake in HCC, a third aim will utilize the trial as a molecular screening process to create an enriched sub-cohort of patients with FDG-avid tumors. These patients will undergo serial FDG PET/CT to evaluate FDG as a source of predictive biomarkers of ICI response for an orthogonal molecular sub-type of HCC. If these diagnostic tests are found reliable at predicting tumor resistance/response, they could significantly enhance the clinical precision and overall benefit of immunotherapy for HCC and possibly other cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE  While immune-checkpoint inhibitor antibodies are a major advance in cancer treatment, only a minority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (the most common form of primary liver cancer) will benefit from this form of immunotherapy. This project comprises a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging and DNA sequencing based liquid biopsy as diagnostic tools for predicting resistance to immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is to determine whether using these tests can potentially increase a patient’s chance of receiving a drug that will help them.",Evaluation of treatment predictors reflecting beta-catenin activation in hepatocellular carcinoma,10277385,R01CA262460,"['Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Induced Mutation', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minority', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor Markers', 'United States', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'advanced disease', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-L1', 'antibody inhibitor', 'base', 'beta catenin', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cancer therapy', 'cell free DNA', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging agent', 'imaging biomarker', 'immune-related adverse events', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'melanoma', 'men', 'metabolic phenotype', 'migration', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'objective response rate', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,QUEEN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,520008
"Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that delivery of higher radiation doses to the prostate results in improved tumor control rates in prostate cancer radiation therapy (RT). As local recurrence mostly occurs at the primary tumor, particularly for high-risk patients, additional dose escalation is expected to improve the treatment outcome. However, the application of dose escalation for prostate RT is greatly limited by the tolerance of nearby healthy tissues that cannot adequately be excluded from the radiation field. This limitation can be overcome by dose painting, where a higher dose is applied to the prostate tumor only instead of the whole prostate gland. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers reduced treatment time, convenience, and possibly increased treatment efficacy as compared to the conventionally fraction scheme. UTSW is currently conducting a dose escalation trial using SBRT for high-risk prostate cancer patients with an integrated dose boost on MRI-visualized prostate tumor. However, prostate can move and deform during the beam delivery. To ensure the escalated dose is actually delivered to tumor regions as planned, a reliable tumor tracking method is urgently needed. While intra-prostatic tumors can be identified by multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment planning, intrafraction tumor tracking during the beam delivery is not achievable with mpMRI. In contrast, ultrasound offers a cost-effective and real-time imaging with high soft tissue contrast. However, conventional ultrasound techniques only provide anatomic structure of the prostate gland without the capability to differentiate tumor region from the rest of the prostate gland. Temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) has emerged as a new paradigm for prostate tissue characterization by analyzing the time-series ultrasound images with advanced machine learning techniques. In this project, we aim to develop, optimize and evaluate an innovative TeUS based intra-prostatic tumor tracking method to guide SBRT with an integrated dose boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The specific aims are: 1) Develop TeUS-based intra-prostatic tumor delineation for guiding focused dose escalation; 2) Integrate and validate TeUS-based tumor tracking system during SBRT; and 3) Evaluate clinical gain of TeUS guided SBRT for high risk prostate cancer patients. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development and validation of a low-cost yet highly accurate TeUS guided system for targeted prostate cancer RT. With enhanced real-time visualization of tumor, the use of TeUS for RT guidance will lead to better treatment efficacy and reduced toxicity. Delivery of higher radiation doses to the tumor region can improve outcome of radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients. As the prostate can move and deform during radiation beam delivery, there is an urgent need for a reliable method to ensure escalated dose is delivered to the tumor region as planned. We will develop, integrate and evaluate a novel prostate tumor tracking method based on temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) to guide radiation therapy for high-risk patients, which will lead to higher local control with improved toxicity.",Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT,10107816,R01EB027898,"['Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Prostatic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'advanced prostate cancer', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'early phase trial', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer risk', 'prostate lesions', 'real-time images', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,344156
"Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response ABSTRACT  Low-grade glioma is the most common brain tumor in children and often involves one or more structures of the anterior visual pathway (i.e., optic nerves, chiasm and tracts). Nearly 20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) will develop a low-grade glioma of the anterior visual pathway, which are called optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). NF1-OPGs are not amenable to surgical resection and can cause permanent vision loss ranging from a mild decline in visual acuity to complete blindness. Children with NF1-OPGs typically experience vision loss between 1 and 8 years of age and are monitored with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess disease progression. However, traditional two-dimensional (2D) measures of tumor size are not appropriate to assess change over time and how NF1-OPGs are responding to treatment.  Our proposal addresses the lack of robust and standardized quantitative imaging (QI) tools and methods needed for NF1-OPG clinical trials. We will develop and validate a novel three-dimensional (3D) MRI-based QI application for automated and comprehensive quantification of these unique pediatric tumors. We will use machine learning algorithms to accommodate MRI sequences from different manufacturers and protocols. We hypothesize that the novel QI application will accurately assess treatment response in clinical trials. In this project, we will validate our QI software and machine learning methods to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape using data from a phase 3 clinical trial of NF1-OPGs. From these measures, we will create methods to assess response to therapy that will enable physicians to make informed and objective treatment decisions.  Our specific aims are: 1) Develop a comprehensive QI application to perform accurate automated quantification of NF1-OPGs; 2) Determine and predict treatment response using our 3D QI measures of tumor volume; and 3) Validate our 3D QI measures using visual acuity outcomes.  Upon study completion, our QI application could transform clinical care for NF1-OPG by identifying the earliest time to determine a favorable versus unfavorable treatment response. The QI application's ability to accurately measure treatment response, along with harmonizing data across MRI manufacturers and protocols, will standardize imaging assessments essential to NF1-OPG clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In children with brain tumors impacting their vision, physicians have difficulty determining when the treatment is working. We will improve upon the very basic and often inaccurate human measurements of tumor size by developing quantitative imaging tools to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape. From these measures, we will create methods that will enable clinical trials and physicians to make informed decisions about the treatment’s success and whether the child will recover their vision.",Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response,10197029,UG3CA236536,"['3-Dimensional', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Brain Neoplasm', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complete Blindness', 'Data', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Chiasm', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Glioma', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Volume', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Pathways', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer predisposition', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,UG3,2021,446107
"Development of A High Throughput Image-Guided IMRT System for Preclinical Research Project Summary/Abstract Preclinical radiobiology experiments on small animals are crucial to test the safety and efficacy before human clinical trials. However, limited by currently available technologies, preclinical animal studies substantially differ from state-of-the-art human treatments in dose conformity. Consequently, the animal studies poorly mimic the radiobiological, radioimmunological, and toxicity environment of human therapies. The disparity adversely affects our ability to meaningfully test hypotheses that are intended for human translation. With decades of advancement, human radiotherapy has achieved high targeting accuracy and dose conformality based on technological breakthroughs, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), which is unavailable for mouse experiments. A practical device and algorithm to modulate the x-ray intensity for the scale of small animals is the first step to bridge the gap. With the support of an NIH R21 grant, we engineered a novel small animal IMRT dose modulator termed sparse orthogonal collimator (SOC). Equally important as the hardware, we created the enabling mathematical tools to deliver SOC IMRT plans with higher achievable resolution than a theoretically miniaturized MLC-based IMRT. We commissioned and tested prototypical SOCs to deliver highly modulated doses in silico and on phantoms. Nonetheless, there are still large gaps between an intensity modulation device and a small animal IMRT system suitable for broad adoption and impact. The required time, resources, and training to create sophisticated SOC-IMRT plans are incompatible with preclinical settings. Furthermore, without automation, the existing image-guided small animal IMRT treatment is prohibitively slow for treating live animals under anesthesia. Lastly, the current manual method to switch between imaging and therapy modes results in intractable uncertainties in dose delivery. We propose to fill these gaps using automation, robotics, and system optimization. We propose the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1 (SA1). Automated organ segmentation for mice using deep learning neural networks. Specific Aim 2 (SA2). Development of a fully functional, automated, and efficient IMRT system. Specific Aim 3 (SA3). Development and validation of a robotic Multi Mouse Automated Treatment Environment (Multi-MATE) for automated imaging and treatment. Besides dosimetry, we will quantify the time performance, which is critical to small animal IMRT system. As a result, in addition to improving the hardware accuracy and reliability, the proposed project will provide a fully automated planning and delivery system, thus removing the last barriers towards the broad adoption of small animal IMRT. The success of the proposed project will help existing research to achieve the full potential for human translation and enable future hypotheses testing where accurate complex dose distribution is critical. Project Narrative A major impediment in translating animal radiation studies to human patients is the disparity in radiation techniques. Existing methods cannot create human like conformal radiation dose on mice with necessary accuracy and efficiency. To better mimic human treatment without prohibitively complicated and slow procedures, we propose to develop a high throughput image guided small animal conformal irradiation platform.",Development of A High Throughput Image-Guided IMRT System for Preclinical Research,10317441,R01CA259008,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collimator', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiobiology', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'biological research', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'dosimetry', 'experimental study', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'irradiation', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'process optimization', 'robotic system', 'safety testing', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,441662
"Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative tracer images from combined PET-CT and PET-MR are increasingly being utilized for radiological decision-making and clinical trials. CT and MR based data corrections for PET photon attenuation, typically the largest impact on tracer quantification, can lead to increased radiation dose to the subject or require lengthy additional dedicated MR scans, respectively. Artificial intelligence algorithms that use the PET signal originating from the subject alone to estimate attenuation have shown promising early results, but, can have reduced performance when applied to exams different from the training data. Reconstruction methods that jointly estimate both the measured attenuation and tracer contrast from the subject PET signal represent a viable alternative, but, to date, have failed to match the quantification of CT approaches. Consequently, no single approach for PET attenuation correction that consistently produces high quantification and does not compromise patient safety or throughput currently exists. This is an important problem, since research and clinical findings must balance these practical issues with data quality. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and characterize a high performance attenuation correction scheme that utilizes both the PET signal from the subject and a variable activity external source. The central hypothesis is that the proposed reconstruction method will have significantly improved performance over reconstruction algorithms using PET signal originating from the subject alone, independent of the imaging study. The two specific aims include: 1) developing and validating a supplemental transmission-based algorithm for correcting PET images for photon attenuation during commercial PET imaging and 2) prototyping and characterizing a device capable of dynamically varying external source activity. The result of Aim 1 will be a reconstruction algorithm that is optimized to produce quantitative PET data for some of the most common clinical PET studies. Under Aim 2, a prototype device that can repeatability vary the external source activity in order to maximize tracer quantification while minimizing the unavoidable degradation to patient tracer image noise, caused by the introduction of any external source, will be produced. The innovation is an attenuation correction strategy that greatly mitigates the limitations of previous joint reconstruction methods to deliver quantitative PET diagnostics that are expected to match those of silver standard CT approaches. This is significant because the number of patients receiving brain and cardiac PET-CT scans, exams the proposed method is expected to benefit, is steadily increasing. For PET-MR, the method may improve tracer quantification where MR has limited performance and increase patient throughput by eliminating the need for non-diagnostic attenuation-only MR acquisitions. Thus, the proposed strategy has great potential to significantly improve radiological decision- making and clinical trial findings that rely on quantitative PET uptake measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to the public health because the development of a PET radiotracer attenuation correction strategy that is independent of the exam type, has the potential to improve the strength of research and clinical findings based on quantitative PET measurements. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIBIB's mission that pertains to enhancing existing imaging and bioengineering modalities.",Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging,10222671,R03EB028946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Scattering', 'Radioactive', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Source', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Tube', 'attenuation', 'base', 'data quality', 'experimental study', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'patient safety', 'pediatric patients', 'prototype', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'transmission process', 'uptake']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2021,86474
"Accuracy and Precision in CT Quantification of COPD Through Virtual Imaging Trials Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death. Increasing in prevalence, COPD is a major burden to patients and providers. Computed tomography (CT) can provide valuable information about the structural and functional abnormalities of the disease as demonstrated in numerous studies where quantitative CT is deployed to characterize and evaluate the treatment. For instance, the COPDGene study has recently shown the substantial role of quantitative CT in the redefinition of COPD diagnosis, and in evaluating the progression of emphysema over time. However, these biomarkers vary across different scanners, settings, and patient attributes. There is a crucial need to manage this variability by optimizing and harmonizing CT images for reliable biomarker quantifications across both current and emerging scanners. This goal is not possible through conventional methods of using physical phantoms or patient images. Physical phantoms are often oversimplified and not representative of the complex anatomy and physiology of COPD patients. Patient images are ground-truth-limited, i.e., the exact anatomy and physiology of the patient is not fully known. Further, patient-based comparisons require multiple acquisitions of the same subjects across different scanners and settings. This is not ethically possible since repeated imaging increases the absorbed radiation dose. These challenges can be overcome through the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) where studies are performed in silico using computational models of patients and scanners. VITs can provide reliable and practical solution to the challenge of COPD imaging provided realistic models of patients and scanners. Such models are currently lacking in the context of COPD. We develop and then utilize realistic virtual imaging toolsets to systematically evaluate and optimize CT biomarkers in COPD patients across scanners, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. We develop the first library of realistic COPD patient models with diverse attributes and severities. Coupled with accurate models of different scanners, the phantoms will be used to generate sets of ground-truth-known virtual CT cases, to be disseminated to the research community and to be used to systematically evaluate the effects of current and emerging scanners, various patient attributes, and the effects of image processing algorithms (through a national challenge), on the accuracy and precision of COPD biomarkers. Further, we develop and optimize a truth-based artificial intelligence-based algorithm for COPD quantifications. We optimize the algorithm for accuracy and reproducibility, taking advantage of the ground-truth known simulated images . We then harmonize CT settings across different scanners to accurately and precisely assess COPD imaging biomarkers for both single time-point and longitudinal studies. The studies will be done for the top two image processing algorithms, identified in the challenge, as well as our developed algorithm. Through these efforts, the project will position CT as a more reliable method for improved characterization and monitoring of COPD. Narrative The project aims to systematically evaluate and optimize quantitative CT imaging biomarkers in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, across scanner makes and models, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. This will be performed by developing and using in silico models of COPD patients and CT scanners.

"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,10168531,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,724046
"Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation therapy is one of the major approaches for cancer treatment. Treatment planning, the process of designing the optimal treatment plan for each patient, is one of the most critical steps. If a treatment is poorly designed, a satisfactory outcome cannot be achieved, regardless of the quality of other treatment steps. Treatment planning in modern radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem defined by a set of hyperparameters. While there exists several quantifiable metrics to quantify plan quality and guide the planning process, these are simplified representations that cannot fully describe the physician’s intent. In addition, these metrics only measure plan quality from a population-based perspective, and cannot guide treatment planning to achieve the patient-specific best treatment plans. Hence, the best physician-preferred solution often sits in a gray area, only achievable by an extensive trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning process and interactions between the planner and physician. Consequently, planning time can take up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor, if the planner is inexperienced and/or under heavy time constraints. These consequences substantially deteriorate treatment outcomes, as having been clearly demonstrated in clinical studies. Recently, the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in imitation learning allows human- like decision making by observing a human expert’s actions and internally building its own decision-making system. In response to PAR-18-530, the goal of this project is to develop and translate an AI planner that mimics human experts’ behavior to generate a high quality plan. The AI planner will not replace human planners. Instead, the AI plan will be used as a starting point in the current planning process to improve plan quality and planning efficiency. The human planner’s actions on further plan improvement can feed back to the AI planner through continuous learning for its continuous evolution. We will pursue this goal using prostate cancer as the test bed through an academic-industrial partnership, jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc. The following specific aims are defined. Aim 1: Model and algorithm development. We will collect experts’ behavior data in routine treatment planning and train the AI planner. Aim 2: System validation and translation. We will integrate the AI planner into Varian Eclipse treatment planning system and validate the system in a clinically realistic setting. The innovations include the use of a state-of-the-art AI imitation learning algorithm to solve a clinically important problem, the novel technological capabilities enabled by the developed system, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end users. Deliverability is ensured by extensive preliminary studies and the partnership integrating complementary expertise and resources. Clinical translation of the AI planner will bring substantial impacts to radiotherapy by providing high-quality and efficient treatment planning to benefit patients, especially those in resource-limited regions. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes.

"Prism-PET: A TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector technology for total-body PET imaging Abstract  The relatively small axial field-of-view (FOV) in almost all PET scanners has severely limited their sensitivity and resulted in significant tradeoffs between image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), acquisition time, and delivered dose. The solution is to improve geometric coverage using large axial FOV for total-body imaging which has the potential to improve sensitivity by about 40 times compared to existing commercial whole-body PET scanners. The construction of the world's first total-body PET/CT scan-ner, called EXPLORER, with 194-cm axial FOV has recently been completed. However, it has a poor time-of-flight (TOF) resolution of 430 ps, compared to the state-of-the-art whole-body PET scanner with 200 ps timing resolution (Siemens Biograph Vision). In addition, axial detector penetration of obliquely incident gamma photons detected within this wide acceptance angle will introduce significant depth-of-interaction (DOI) parallax error, leading to degraded spatial resolution. These two major defi-ciencies of the EXPLORER scanner offset its effective sensitivity gain, specially for imaging single organs such as the human brain when compared to the Biograph Vision PET scanner. For this research, we propose to build cost-effective block detectors with combined highest spatial resolution (2 mm), highest TOF resolution (<120 ps and potentially 100 ps), best DOI localization (1.85 mm), and highest inter- crystal Compton scatter recovery capabilities (88%) using single-ended readout and machine learning post-processing engines. Our novel detector module, called Prism-PET, enables these capabilities by mimicking very closely the behavior of dual-ended readout with enhanced and controlled light sharing using a segmented array of right angle prism-mirror light guides. Given our promising preliminary ex-perimental results, we aim to accomplish the following tasks: (1) model a prototype TOF-DOI PET scanner using GATE Monte Carlo simulations and use its list-mode data to develop our TOF-DOI image recontruction; (2) build Prism-PET detector modules and characterize coincidence detector blocks for DOI-corrected spatial resolution, energy resolution, and timing resolution and use machine learning to recover inter-crystal Compton scattered events to reach the 2-mm intrinsic spatial resolution without sacrificing sensitivity; (3) Build a one-ring prototype Prism-PET scanner; (4) perform normalization scan, optimize our image reconstruction using experimental coincidence events and validate the optimal imaging performance using Hot Spot phantoms. Our proposed TOF-DOI-Compton detector and system technologies maximize the sensitivity benefits of improved geometric coverage in total-body PET scanners across the entire FOV. Narratives/Relevance  The EXPLORER total-body PET scanner has limitations due to its poor timing resolution and lack of DOI-encoding, both of which offset its effective sensitivity gain, specially for imaging single organs, despite the very costly improvement of its geometric coverage. In the proposed work we will develop cost-effective and practical single-ended TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector modules, where these capabilities are enabled by using our novel right an-gle prism mirror light guides which enhance (1) light sharing by efficient 180-degree bending of photon paths and (2) crystal identification by localiz-ing the shared photons to only those immediate neighboring pixels that help with the correct identification. Our Prism-PET scanner with < 120 ps timing resolution, 1.85 mm DOI-encoding, and 88% Compton-scatter recovery miti-gates the limitations with the EXPLORER total-body scanner and achieves unparalleled spatial resolution and sensitivity.",Prism-PET: A TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector technology for total-body PET imaging,10233306,R01EB030413,"['Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Collaborations', 'Compton radiation', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Floods', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Industrialization', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'detector', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk mitigation', 'simulation']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,647165
"Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients Project Summary  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new patients in the US every year. Standard of care therapies include stereotactic surgical resection, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. After initial treatment, patient monitoring is guided by standard MR imaging performed at routine intervals. Despite these rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15 months. Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in brain tumor patients can be challenging to interpret and is further confounded by interpretation variability. Accurate interpretation of imaging is particularly important during the post-treatment phase of patient care as it can help clinicians proactively manage disease through early, precise characterization of true tumor recurrence. Disease-specific structured reporting systems attempt to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS), developed at Emory University, is one such framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of follow-up imaging. While BT-RADS has had success with clinical adoptability, it still faces hurdles reducing interobserver variability and improving objective classification of disease state.  This proposed study addresses an unmet need for unbiased, quantitative metrics for robust, objective interpretation of follow-up imaging for GBM patients. Where previous evaluative methods used two-dimensional, representative MRI slices for evaluating the extent of tumor, we propose to develop a deep learning segmentation tool, accurately calculating volumes of tumor after surgical resection, and trained from our expansive database of patient data with contours manually drawn by radiation oncologists. Further, we propose to develop computationally advanced software for predicting disease progression building upon the clinically developed BT- RADS criteria. Such tools would assist physicians in caring for brain tumor patients through post-treatment surveillance and guide future clinical decision making. In addition, we believe these quantitative metrics would have unbounded potential in clinical trial settings where it may be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics for GBM. Therefore, these assistive tools will be tested on clinical trial data to determine if they are superior to conventional measurements alone.  A fundamental goal of this proposal is ensuring the quantitative tools we develop are applicable for clinicians in their daily lives. Therefore, an effort will be made to collaborate extensively with clinicians to house the algorithms in sleek, intuitive software for physicians to utilize. Through the multidisciplinary environment, high performance computing, and clinical resources we have available, we believe this proposal will be successful in developing clinically assistive tools for unbiased, objective monitoring of GBM patients in clinical settings and evaluation of novel therapies in research settings. Project Narrative  Follow-up imaging for glioblastoma patients is challenging to interpret due to subjectivity in evaluating disease state and overlap between treatment effects and tumor progression. More objective follow-up criteria are vital for sensitive and accurate monitoring of glioblastoma patients after initial treatment to ensure proactive management of disease and accurate characterization of tumor recurrence. This research proposal will develop user-friendly quantitative software for lesion segmentation and disease-state assessment, providing unbiased metrics for post-treatment patient monitoring and guidance of management decisions in clinical and research settings.",Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients,10071871,F31CA247564,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'aggressive therapy', 'automated image analysis', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'efficacy evaluation', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'implementation framework', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'quantitative imaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy Project Summary  Radiotherapy (RT) aims to deliver tumoricidal dose to clinical target volume (CTV) while sparing organs at risk (OAR), for which proton and photon beams are naturally complementary to each other: protons are generally better for OAR sparing, while photons are more robust to delivery uncertainties for CTV coverage. The hybrid proton-photon RT has a long history. However, as it generates proton and photon plans separately without fully utilizing joint proton-photon optimization during the planning stage, current hybrid RT is pseudo- hybrid and very limited in plan quality, treatment sites, and broad applicability. The key to leapfrog from pseudo-hybrid to truly-hybrid RT is new joint proton-photon optimization method that synergizes complementary proton and photon beams. The hypothesis is that truly-hybrid RT via appropriate joint proton- photon optimization will be more favorable than proton or photon-only RT, in terms of CTV coverage robustness and OAR sparing optimality.  Broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT to patients: (A) Clinical applicability: unlike pseudo-hybrid RT that is limited in plan quality and treatment sites, truly-hybrid RT may become a new paradigm for general cancer RT, owing to its superior plan quality and thus potentially clinical outcomes to proton-only or photon-only RT. (B) Clinical workflow: our truly-hybrid plans can be individually and safely delivered on existing proton and photon machines, and this effort envisions patients being treated in an integrated cancer center like ours with both proton and photon equipment, under the direction of a single physician, using shared immobilization devices, simulation procedure and structure set, and integrated treatment planning and delivery system. (C) Patient coverage: truly-hybrid RT can be made broadly available to many cancer patients through existing infrastructures in US, since (1) most hospitals with proton centers also have photon centers; (2) 76% of cancer patients live in the states with operational proton centers, while 85% are within 100-mile (2-hour-driving) distances to these proton centers; (3) cancer patients are more willing to travel for advanced treatment options.  Proposed effort: Inspired by unprecedented plan quality and broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT via our joint proton-photon optimization method, the next step is to test the hypothesis prospectively via clinical trials. However, a missing prerequisite to advance truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic is a treatment planning system (TPS) that can generate clinically-deliverable hybrid plans. To meet this urgent need, this effort will develop novel optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT, which is a radical step towards prospective clinical trials for testing the hypothesis.  Aim 1: Optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT.  Aim 2: Optimization methods for accurate and efficient MCO truly-hybrid planning.  Aim 3: Deep learning based optimization methods for efficient truly-hybrid planning. Project Narrative  This project will develop truly-”2D” proton-photon joint optimization methods for clinically-deliverable truly- hybrid RT with unprecedented superior plan quality to proton-only and photon-only RT, and first-of-its-kind TPS to bridge truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic. This hybrid TPS can facilitate prospective clinical trials of a broad spectrum of treatment sites for many patients. If succeed, truly-hybrid RT via this first-of-its-kind TPS will likely warrant improved clinical outcomes with reduced OAR toxicities, and potentially become a new paradigm for cancer RT in general, with compelling benefits in both treatment cost and clinical outcomes.",Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy,10207870,R37CA250921,"['Automobile Driving', 'Bathing', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Equipment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Immobilization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiotherapy Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Travel', 'Treatment Cost', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'clinical application', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'treatment site']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,356850
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue. Patient care and clinical decision-making will improve dramatically as a complete picture of histological features underlying brain tumor imaging emerges from this proposal.",Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology,10173711,R01CA218144,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Glioblastoma', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computational algorithm', 'Contrast Media', 'Cytology', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Gadolinium', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radio', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress Tests', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Wisconsin', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor imaging', 'cancer cell', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical decision-making', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2021,352275
