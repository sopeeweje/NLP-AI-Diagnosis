"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications. n/a",SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections,9976740,R01AG067396,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriuria', 'Caregivers', 'Catheters', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'laboratory facility', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,299197,-0.006244822050570579
"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9748523,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,195128,0.027835613795447724
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9783816,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,438449,-0.016673784105916807
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY We propose a study of radiomic texture analysis in terms of robustness assessment and classification utility. We will introduce novel robustness metrics geared towards assessment of radiomic features in comparison across two image conditions, and apply these metrics to study feature robustness across imaging parameters and patient biology. In addressing the utility of radiomic features in cancer risk assessment, we will identify and evaluate texture signatures from mammography and tomosynthesis datasets. The field of radiomics is evolving fast, and quantitative texture analysis is being applied to a growing number of applications in medical imaging. By performing a thorough investigation of the robustness of these radiomic features to dataset heterogeneities we aim to identify the strengths and weaknesses of commonly used features to guide their implementations on future applications.  Two clinical tasks will be studied under the proposed research: 1) risk assessment and cancer prediction and 2) malignancy evaluation. Multiple modalities including tomosynthesis, mammography and MRI will be involved in studies geared towards addressing these clinical questions. An evaluation of the robustness of commonly employed radiomic features will help guide the field of medical texture analysis and contribute to meaningful conclusions in future studies throughout the field of quantitative image analysis. The first aim of the proposed research involves the proposition and evaluation of novel robustness metrics for investigations lacking a classification task. The second aim will extend the study of radiomics to investigate the utility of robust features in classification tasks and identification of texture signatures relate to biomedical characteristics. The third aim will build upon the two previous aims and culminate in the application of cutting-edge technologies in machine learning and deep learning in further promoting image processing in the field of medical physics. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate and improve the application of radiomic texture features in cancer risk assessment. We will accomplish this by evaluating the robustness of various radiomic metrics, testing the classification utility of texture features in clinical tasks, and extending current classification methods to include cutting-edge developments in machine learning technology. Careful preliminary studies have demonstrated methods for selection of robust texture features and improvement in classification tasks by emphasizing feature robustness in feature selection methodology and we therefore believe that a meticulous evaluation of the impact of imaging parameters on feature calculations will lead to overall improvement of computer-aided diagnosis and clinical translation to progress in cancer screening protocols.",Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment,9683697,F31CA228247,"['Address', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impact evaluation', 'Incidence', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'expectation', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular subtypes', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'tomosynthesis', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2019,24304,-0.02478000347434596
"Development of an adaptive machine learning platform for automated analysis of biomarkers in biomedical images ABSTRACT Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduce bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings. These problems are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine, developing effective medical treatments, and promoting confidence in scientific inquiry. Identification of biomarkers and cellular targets following microscopy requires manual analysis of biomedical images, which is time intensive, difficult, and prone to bias and errors. Unintentional bias and attentional limitations during analysis of biomarkers can underlie poor reproducibility of findings in biomedical research and potentially introduce error in clinical diagnostics. We recently developed a “beta” software package designed to improve automation and standardization of image analysis, called “PIPSQUEAK” (Perineuronal net Intensity Program for the Standardization and Quantification of Extracellular matrix Analysis Kit). Since its publication in 2016, PIPSQUEAK beta has amassed approximately 1,300 users worldwide who use it to quantify the intensity and number of perineuronal nets and other neural markers in the brain. This technology significantly increases data reliability between image raters and decreases the time required for analysis by more than 100-fold. However, PIPSQUEAK beta currently uses target detection algorithms that require high-contrast images to automatically identify neurons as clusters of bright pixels on dark backgrounds. A significant current limitation to PIPSQUEAK beta, and other available imaging programs, is that detection of biomarkers can be difficult unless image conditions are ideal. Suboptimal conditions, like high background staining, off-target structures, overlapping or clustered biomarkers, and atypical morphologies, can lead to artifacts and consequently to inaccurate results and erroneous conclusions. Here, we propose to develop a user-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) platform for the automated detection of targeted biomarkers in digital microscopy that reduces this error by learning to distinguish between true cellular biomarkers and artifacts. We propose to integrate AI capabilities into our PIPSQUEAK technology to produce an adaptive, high-throughput, biomedical image analysis platform that quickly and accurately identifies biomarker targets from bench to bedside. A key advantage is that this AI program will be user friendly and available online, making it highly accessible to basic researchers and to technicians and clinicians identifying human pathologies. Thus, successful development of our AI program has a high translational potential. The goal of this proposal is 1) to develop and validate a machine learning model that is capable of detecting common histological marker morphologies in digital microscopy, and 2) to test the feasibility of adapting our AI platform to new biomarker datasets with minimal additional supervised training. Our end goal is to advance the reliability and speed of research findings and clinical diagnoses by making this technology widely available to researchers and clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduces bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings; problems which are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine and developing effective medical treatments.

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9706921,R01HL142036,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual clinical trial']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,381629,0.025243108170767276
"Development and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Approach to Interpret Optical Coherence Tomography Images of the Middle Ear to Improve Antibiotic Management PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to interpret TOMi Scope depth-resolved images using a set of ear models with human middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, antibiotic stewardship for ear health. Significance: Ear infections affect 95% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antibiotic over-prescription and antibiotic resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of MEE through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic accuracy (50- 70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user experience. Therefore, objective image classification metrics to enable improved diagnostic accuracy is sorely needed to finally provide children afflicted by this disease with the correct treatment the first time. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope image classification of a set of ear models with human MEE will facilitate detection of the presence or absence of effusion (≥90% accuracy), as well as classification by the type of effusion samples (≥80% accuracy), regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect robust datasets of ex vivo human MEE, sufficient for machine learning image analysis. (2) Develop a neural network model based on the MEE dataset and apply the model to a representative test clinical dataset to determine classification feasibility. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antibiotic prescription but also antibiotic resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience dependence of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Development and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Approach to Interpret Optical Coherence Tomography Images of the Middle Ear to Improve Antibiotic Management,9847606,R43DC017422,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Infection', 'Intestines', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otoscopy', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Resistance development', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Sterility', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'ear infection', 'effusion', 'ex vivo imaging', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'middle ear', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDCD,"PHOTONICARE, INC.",R43,2019,223899,-0.002778186461090274
"IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging Project Summary This proposal requests funds to provide travel support for graduates to attend and participate in the IEEE Inter- national Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019 conference, Venice, Italy on April 08-11, 2019. The main objective of the IEEE ISBI is to bring together researchers with interests in mathematical and computa- tional aspects of biomedical imaging, with a focus on addressing problems of significance to the development and application of imaging systems across spatial scales, from microscopy to whole-body imaging. ISBI partici- pants – on the order of 600-700 from across the world are involved in biomedical imaging research and development in academic institutions, government laboratories, or R&D departments of private companies. ISBI is co-sponsored by two IEEE societies: Signal Processing Society (SPS) and Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS), representing academia, industry, and healthcare, and considered the world's foremost societies in biomedical engineering and imaging. SPS and EMBS publish IEEE Transactions on Medical Imag- ing, Transactions on Image Processing, Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, Transactions on Computational Imaging, and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, among others. Since incep- tion in 2002, ISBI has become the leading international conference bringing together researchers from diverse algorithmic fields, applications, modalities, and size scales, to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas across imag- ing modalities and scales. Conference topics include physical, biological and statistical modeling, image formation and reconstruction, computational and statistical image analysis, visualization and image quality as- sessment, and artificial intelligence and machine learning for big image data. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of a 4-page paper. Peer reviews are handled by a 50-mem- ber editorial board (area editors) of leading experts in the community, who in turn assign papers to well- qualified reviewers. All oral and poster papers are published in IEEExplore as Proceedings of ISBI. If awarded, IEEE anticipates the primary impact of this R13 grant will be increased attendance of U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. By offering to cover a significant portion of attendee's travel expenses, the cost-benefit ratio for attending ISBI 2019 will be extremely favorable. Furthermore, IEEE will award travel grants based on need and scientific excellence, creating opportunities for those early career researchers who have accepted papers (of which less than 50% are accepted to ISBI) and who have limited means to travel. IEEE will be particularly supportive in providing travel awards to women, under-represented groups, and persons with disabilities. Benefits can largely be summarized as “exposure” and education. ISBI provides opportunity for student exposure to many more areas of computational imaging research than generally available in her/his home institution, and concurrently provides opportunity for students to interact with leaders in the field through tutorials, plenary, oral, and poster presentations, and individual discussions. This proposal requests funds to provide travel support for graduate to attend and participate in the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019 conference, to be held in Venice, Italy on April 08-11, 2019.

"Image analytics prediction of corneal keratoplasty failure Image analytics for prediction of keratoplasty failure Summary We will create specialized image analytics software for prediction of keratoplasty (penetrating, endothelial) fail- ure from specular-reflection corneal endothelial cell (EC) images. Keratoplasties are the most common tissue transplant, with roughly a 10% failure rate, leading to blindness, patient discomfort/anxiety, and repeat kerato- plasties with a higher chance for failure than the initial procedure. With successful predictive image analytics, we will be in a position to identify transplanted corneas at risk and possibly treat them more aggressively with topical corticosteroids or other measures to prevent failure. Since a functional endothelial cell (EC) layer is necessary for the active ionic-pump-driven redistribution of fluid necessary to maintain the clear cornea, EC images have been analyzed as an indicator of cornea health. The normal EC layer exhibits high cell density arranged in a predominantly regular, hexagonal array. We will build on the use of existing quantitative bi- omarkers from EC images (EC density, coefficient of variation of cell areas, and hexagonality) used to evaluate cornea health. We will compute additional image features associated with local and long-range cell disarray, image attributes relevant to keratoplasty rejection, and traditional features from computer vision. Including this combination of features will provide rich inputs to machine-learning classifiers aimed at predicting future out- comes (e.g., failure or no failure). We will apply methods to a large aggregation of well-curated data from pre- vious NIH-funded studies at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and from previous studies at the Neth- erlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery (NIIOS). Our team consists of image processing experts, oph- thalmologists, and staff from the CWRU Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and University Hospitals (UH) Eye Institute’s Cornea Image Analysis Reading Center (CIARC), which is well-known for rigor- ous, highly repeatable assessment of conventional quantitative biomarkers in a large number of multi- institutional clinical trials. Together, our goal will be to determine if this “second generation” analysis of EC im- ages can lead to prediction of keratoplasty failure. If successful, this project will lead to software which can be translated to support research and clinical practice. Narrative Our goal is to create image analytic software that will predict the risk of keratoplasty failure from readily ob- tained corneal endothelial cell images. With knowledge of eyes at risk, physicians will be able to tailor treat- ments to improve cornea transplant success, thereby very positively impacting patients’ health.",Image analytics prediction of corneal keratoplasty failure,9765316,R21EY029498,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Cell Density', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Companions', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Endothelium', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descemet&apos', 's membrane', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Intraocular lens implant device', 'Intuition', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Netherlands', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetrating Keratoplasty', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Pump', 'Reading', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Software Framework', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Topical Corticosteroids', 'Translating', 'Transplanted tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical practice', 'data management', 'density', 'experimental study', 'hazard', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'validation studies', 'vision science']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,200104,0.016464155062861356
"Automated end-to-end retinal screening system with robotic image capture and deep learning analysis Abstract  In this SBIR project, we propose EyeScreenBot, an end-to-end automated retinal im- age capture and analysis system, comprising a self-driven, robotic fundus camera plat- form for automated image capture and a deep learning-based image analysis engine for generation of automated screening outcome. With the large, growing, and aging popula- tion and the increased prevalence of diabetes, a large number of people are at risk for vision loss due to several eye diseases including diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma. Although eye screening is effective in re- ducing vision loss, there are not enough clinical personnel and eye-care experts for pop- ulation-wide eye screening. Recent advances with automated image analysis are helping alleviate the situation, but they are still limited by the need for good quality images of the patients captured by trained technicians or expensive retinal cameras equipped for auto- mated capture. EyeScreenBot will be developed to provide a truly end-to-end screening solution that is cost-effective and suitable for deployment in primary care clinics or op- tometrist sites, addressing both automated capture and subsequent automated analysis, all without the need for trained technicians or eye experts at the point of care. When deployed and commercialized, this device will rapidly aid scaling of eye screening for the masses, thereby having an enormous impact in improving the quality and accessibility of eye care and helping reduce preventable vision loss. Narrative EyeScreenBot, an end-to-end automated screening system with intelligent image capture and analysis, will truly enable eye screening at massive scale, which is necessary and urgent since the population at risk for preventable vision loss due to retinal diseases (such as diabetic retinopathy) is growing at a staggering rate. Triaging and identification of at-risk patients will allow for timely intervention to prevent, slow, or even reverse the disease progression and loss of vision.",Automated end-to-end retinal screening system with robotic image capture and deep learning analysis,9847891,R43EY029652,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'aging population', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'improved', 'interest', 'macula', 'point of care', 'portability', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'retinal imaging', 'robot interface', 'robotic system', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2019,218618,-0.019835586477234327
"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications.

"Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer. Project Narrative We develop technology that will enable researchers to tap into the enormous amount of imaging data in multiple institutions to create deep learning models for cancer applications without requiring sharing of patient data. Our work will thus enable development of more robust deep learning models to improve clinical decision making in cancer than models currently built on data from single institutions. Although our focus is improving decision making in the primary brain cancer, our methods and tools are generalizable and will be broadly applicable to all cancers, with the potential for improvement in clinical care and patient health.",Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,9827476,U01CA242879,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Brain', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Glioma', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Information Networks', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient privacy', 'radiologist', 'research to practice', 'software systems', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,401628,-0.018573868686930173
"Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification The purpose of flow cytometers is to enable the classification of cells or organisms at high throughput. Label-free optical flow cytometers not based on fluorescence are generally based on scattering. The most common of these compares the amount of forward (FS) versus side (SS) scattering. Such two-parameter information permits rudimentary classification based on size or granularity, but it misses more subtle features that can be critical in defining organism identity. Nevertheless, FS/SS flow cytometry remains popular, largely because of its simplicity and capacity for high throughput.  We propose to develop a label-free computational flow cytometer that preserves much of the simplicity and high-throughput capacity of FS/SS flow cytometry, but provides significantly enhanced information. Instead of characterizing organisms based on scattering direction (as does FS/SS flow cytometry), we will characterize based on scattering patterns. We will insert a reconfigurable diffractive element in the imaging optics of a flow cytometer to route user-defined basis patterns to independent detectors. The basis patterns will be optimally matched to specific sample features. The respective weights of these basis patterns will serve as signatures to identify organisms of interest. The basis patterns themselves will be determined by machine learning algorithms. Both the device and the learning algorithms will be developed from scratch.  We anticipate that our flow cytometer will be able to operate at flow rates on the order of meters per second, commensurate with state-of-the-art FS/SS flow cytometers, while providing significantly more information for improved classification capacity. While our technique should be advantageous for any label-free flow cytometry application requiring high throughput, we will test it here by demonstrating high-throughput classification of microbial communities. NARRATIVE Our goal is to improve the information extraction capacity of label-free flow cytometers, while maintaining high throughput capacity. As such, our device should have a broad range of applications.",Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification,9702053,R21GM128020,"['Address', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pupil', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'microbial community', 'microorganism', 'microorganism classification', 'optical imaging', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'recruit']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2019,206250,-0.001284625856275011
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data.

"Deep Learning of Street View Imagery to assess Urban Green Space Relationships with Mental Health:  A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY The built environment is an important modifiable determinant of human health, yet our ability to understand its effects on human health have been limited by the lack of scalable data on specific components (and exposures) of the built environment. The emergence of ubiquitous geo-referenced imagery in the United States (e.g. Google Street View Imagery), combined with recent advances in image processing using deep learning algorithms, offers unprecedented opportunity for measuring street-level built environment features at scales needed for population-based research. To develop and demonstrate the potential of deep learning algorithms for environmental health research we will: develop methods to assess green space features using street view imagery and deep learning algorithms; create new deep learning algorithms to predict urban green space quality, stress reduction and restorative potential; and apply new street view measures to 9,070 adult Twin Pairs in the Washington Twin Registry to determine associations between green space and mental health. Our proposed study will dramatically move the field of environmental health forward by provided a completely new, transferable and scalable exposure assessment method for assessing built environment exposures relevant to human health and provide robust information on how urban green space influences mental health. Overall, our new approach will provide rich new data sources for environmental epidemiologists, city planners, policy makers and neighborhoods and communities at large.

"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user's location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user's location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user's trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings. The proposed research would result in a new smartphone-based wayfinding app that could greatly increase travel independence for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,9934891,R01EY029033,"['Adoption', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cost Measures', 'Destinations', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elevator', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Indoor environment', 'Infrastructure', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Process', 'Research', 'Schools', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'digital', 'interest', 'meetings', 'open source', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'way finding', 'wireless fidelity']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,105337,-0.026098720605725035
"NIDDK Extramural Digital Pathology Repository System In recent years, new technology and data processing capabilities have removed barriers to integration of molecular and histopathological data sets.

"Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data This project aims to develop NeuroManager™, an innovative neuroinformatics platform for advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data. A core technology that we will develop in NeuroManager will be Image Content Analysis for Retrieval Using Semantics (ICARUS), a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable image retrieval based on visual appearance or by semantic concept. ICARUS will use machine learning applied to content-based image retrieval - (CBIR) to build and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign semantic concepts to neuroimages. Neuroscience research generates extensive, multifaceted data that is considerably under-utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source lab. On the other hand, there are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results. Unfortunately, none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. To solve this problem, NeuroManager will include the following distinct, significant innovations: (i) versatility for handling two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humans; (ii) functionality to share complex datasets that extends secure, privacy-controlled paradigms from institutional, laboratory-based and even public domains; (iii) flexibility to implement NeuroManager within an institute’s IT infrastructure, or on most cloud-based virtualized environments including Azure, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services; (iv) and most importantly, the ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data sets. The benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be to foster collaboration between scientists and institutions, promoting innovation through combined expertise in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. This will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levels (i.e., macroscopically, microscopically, subcellularly and functionally), ultimately leading to an improved basis for developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will prove feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR on 2D whole slide images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaborators. Work in Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations mentioned above. A competing technology with comparable functionality, addressing the full breadth of needs for modern neuroscience research, is currently not available commercially or otherwise.

"A Study to Validate and Improve an Automated Image Analysis Algorithm to Detect Tuberculosis in Sputum Smear Slides Abstract/Summary In this SBIR, we propose to validate our handcrafted image analysis algorithm for auto-detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in a digitized sputum smear. Once validated in a blinded study against manual microscopy and culture (the gold standard), we will try to improve our handcrafted algorithm by integrating, where appropriate, deep-learning approaches (via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)). Our novel diagnostic device (the Diascopic iON platform) uses automated image analysis to detect pathogens of interest. Through a blinded study (400 slides), we will assess the iON's effectiveness in detecting MTB. Our aim is to achieve >99% accuracy vs. microscopy, and sensitivity-specificity vs. culture of 80% and 99%, respectively. Currently, the iON platform can detect MTB on a Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained sputum smear in less than 60 seconds, with accuracy of 95% vs. microscopy. The primary objective of this SBIR is to meet or exceed the minimal requirements for the WHO Target Product Profile (published 2014) of a rapid sputum-based test for detecting TB at the microscopy-center level of the health-care system. We will accomplish this feasibility study through a collaborative effort with the Case Western Reserve University-Uganda (UCRC) research team. A full-slide digitization and automated image analysis of 400 ZN slides is planned while on the ground in Uganda. Results will be published in an appropriate peer-reviewed journal for dissemination to the relevant TB pathology and provider community. A secondary objective of this SBIR is to improve our handcrafted algorithm through the use of deep- learning techniques (CNN). We will collaborate with Dr. Madabhushi (Case Western Reserve) - a world leader in Deep Learning methodologies – on this portion of the study. We are optimistic that by combining our handcrafted approach with a deep-learning approach, we can identify MTB bacilli more effectively (i.e. faster and more accurately). We will leverage the lessons-learned in this study to develop algorithms for other developing-world diseases like Onchocerca (river blindness), Plasmodium (malaria), and Shistomes (schistosomaisis). Successful completion of this SBIR will show that the iON can truly become a platform for automated pathogen detection, which will shift lab practices toward faster & more standardized routines that are performed by unskilled workers. If we're successful in this Phase I SBIR, we will develop auto-detect algorithms for 3-4 other pathogens in a phase II SBIR. We will then market the iON platform to resource-limited clinics in countries adversely affected by developing-world diseases. It is our experience that such clinics are seeking a rapid, low cost, accurate and simple diagnostic tool to improve their efficiency and their ability to detect and treat diseases. Narrative This SBIR is a validation study of a digital pathology platform to detect TB in digitized Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) slides. We aim to establish a high accuracy (>99%) vs. manual microscopy and a sensitivity & specificity of 80% and 99%, respectively, vs. culture. The TB analysis occurs rapidly, with results available in <60 seconds. We will investigate whether algorithm improvements are possible by combining our handcrafted approach with deep-learning approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency. If high accuracy and sensitivity-specificity can be achieved for TB detection, this low-cost technology can have a significant impact on TB laboratory operations around the world.

Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings. The proposed research would result in a new smartphone-based wayfinding app that could greatly increase travel independence for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,9663319,R01EY029033,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cost Measures', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elevator', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Indoor environment', 'Infrastructure', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Needs Assessment', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Research', 'Schools', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'interest', 'lens', 'meetings', 'open source', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'way finding', 'wireless fidelity']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,416374,-0.026098720605725035
"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation. Leveraging our open source SimVascular project, the proposed project will enable rapid expansion of the existing Vascular Model Repository while ensuring model credibility and reproducibility to foster innovation in clinical and basic science cardiovascular research.",Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository,9859232,R01LM013120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Basic Science', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Engineering', 'Source Code', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'computing resources', 'data format', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gigabyte', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open data', 'open source', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'stem', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'supervised learning', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning', 'web portal']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,345016,0.011354550020604136
"SCH:Smartphone Wound Image Parameter Analysis and Decision Support in Mobile Env PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the U.S., with an estimated treatment cost of $25 billion. Our team proposes research to advance our existing NSF-funded smartphone wound analysis system, which helps patients monitor their diabetic foot ulcers, providing them with instant feedback on healing progress. Our wound system analyzes a smartphone image of the patients' wound, detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score by comparing the current image with a past image. Our envisioned chronic wound assessment system will support evidence-based decisions by the care team while visiting patients, and move wound care toward digital objectivity. We define digital objectivity as the synthesis of wound assessment metrics that are extracted autonomously from images in order to generate objective actionable feedback, enabling clinicians not trained as wound specialists to deliver ""standardized wound care"". Digital objectivity contrasts with the current practice of subjective, visual inspection of wounds based on physician experience. The first aim will develop image processing algorithms to mitigate wound analysis errors caused by non-ideal lighting in some clinical or home settings, and when the wound is photographed from arbitrary camera angles and distance. While our previous wound system worked well in ideal conditions, non-ideal lighting caused large errors and healthy skin was detected as the wound area in extreme cases. The second aim extends our existing wound analysis system that targets only diabetic wounds to handle arterial, venous and pressure ulcers, expanding the potential user. The third aim will synthesize algorithms that autonomously generate actionable wound decision rules that are learned from decisions taken by actual wound clinicians. This research is joint work of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) (technical expertise in image processing, machine learning and smartphone programming) and University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) (clinical expertise on wounds, and wound patient recruitment to validate our work) RELEVANCE (See instructions): We propose research to advance our existing smartphone wound analysis system, which detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score from a wound image.

"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology.

"Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc- tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi- ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol- ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam- ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo- rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex- traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us- ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti- cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in- clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova- tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol- umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo- rithms will segment the images at multiple scales. The third area of innovation will focus on efficient multi- channel analysis. The proposed project will include creation of an easy-to-use software tool for assembling and visualizing multiscale tissue data called Tissue Atlas Navigation Graphical Overview (TANGO). PROJECT NARRATIVE Composition and organization of cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) they are embedded in, controls the function of different organs in human body. Alterations in any of these can lead to onset and progression of var- ious diseases. The proposed project will develop image analytics algorithms and open source software for high- resolution 3-D mapping of skin, the largest organ in the human body, and evaluate molecular and architectural changes due to aging and UV exposure.",Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues,9893208,UH3CA246594,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multiomic Data', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organ Model', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Aging', 'Skin Tissue', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'analysis pipeline', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'high dimensionality', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'multiplexed\xa0imaging', 'open source', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sample collection', 'single cell analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tomography', 'tool']",NCI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,UH3,2019,587413,0.022567149900852148
"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives. Project Narrative Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides which currently available solutions do not overcome.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them.

"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,9748417,R01AI138993,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Arizona', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Cells', 'Care Technology Points', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Face', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Health Care', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virotherapy', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'density', 'design', 'health care settings', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'light scattering', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'technology development', 'technology validation']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,991540,-0.028987574360714887
"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi-resolution imaging of the brain and spine while the surgeon operates.",An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System,9764897,R44CA112966,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Capital', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Michigan', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Monitor', 'Navigation System', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spine surgery', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Veterinary Schools', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cancer surgery', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cranium', 'deep neural network', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'neurosurgery', 'next generation', 'operation', 'point of care', 'portability', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spine bone structure', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2019,1350820,-0.00880735118025977
"Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia PROJECT SUMMARY  Abnormalities of white matter are important in schizophrenia. A preponderance of studies have found decreased levels of transcripts for myelin-related proteins in autopsy brains. Some have found decrease in the proteins themselves, and some have not. Hundreds of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of many people with schizophrenia (SCH). Decreased FA is interpreted as disruption of normal architecture. However, postmortem examination has failed to identify characteristic abnormalities. This suggests that abnormalities are subtle, and perhaps postmortem examinations have not used the right tools to find them. We have therefore been developing, as part of a collaboration supported by our concluding Fogarty project, two new methods to characterize white matter at high resolution. The first is a machine learning protocol to measure axonal diameters and myelin sheath thickness in electron microscope (EM) images of prefrontal white matter, recognizing and avoiding artifacts in EM of autopsy tissue. This will enable us to measure thousands of fibers in EM images produced as part of our concluding Fogarty project, from individuals with SCH, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no psychiatric illness (NPI). The second method, suggested by the DTI findings, is to analyze the arrangement of the axons themselves. We will use 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of high-resolution images of the axons themselves, identified by Bielschowsky silver stain or immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated neurofilament protein. To obtain high-resolution images of Bielschowsy stains, we will take advantage of the recent observation by Dr. Mark Sonders, co-investigator on this project, that these and other heavy metal stains luminesce under 2-photon infrared excitation. This yields clear and measurable images of individual axons. We will perform these procedures on sections from existing paraffin blocks that comprise a complete left prefrontal coronal section from 36 triads containing 1 case each of SCH, MDD, or NPI, matched for sex and age. These brains were included in earlier studies that yielded data on protein composition, mRNA for myelin-related proteins, DNA methylation, microglial activation, and semiquantitative myelin histology. In a third, exploratory aim, we will employ graphical models to combine these various types of data with known properties of CNS white matter and myelin to build a model of what is disturbed in schizophrenia. We expect that novel techniques for data fusion will reveal associations based on multidimensional correlations that could not be detected by modeling the single-domain datasets separately. In the process of completing these scientific aims, we will pursue the pedagogic goals of training the first two professional biostatisticians in Macedonia, and an academic pathologist. We will also hold a seminar course for biological researchers to build awareness and understanding of the power of biostatistical and other computational methods to enrich their research. NARRATIVE Our ongoing Fogarty/NIMH research project in Macedonia (R01 MH060877, “Building Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia”), has demonstrated biochemical abnormalities of white matter in schizophrenia that are not present in major depressive disorder. However, we have not seen anatomical abnormalities of white matter, which MRI studies of schizophrenia tell us should exist, and as the biochemistry also suggests. To explore white matter in novel ways, we are developing new methods of microscopy, image analysis and statistical inference, which we now propose to employ on a large scale.",Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia,9953486,R56MH117769,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academy', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electrons', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Macedonia', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myelin', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurofilament Proteins', 'Paraffin', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Silver Staining', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'high resolution imaging', 'histological image', 'histological studies', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R56,2019,10000,-0.0183682392331139
"Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology ABSTRACT Acute infections of the middle ear (acute otitis media - AOM), are the most commonly treated childhood disease. Treatment is fueled by concern for complications and effects on children's cognitive and language development. The financial burden of AOM is estimated at more than $5 billion per year. Because AOM is so common, a major societal problem is the over-diagnosis and over-treatment of this disease, as a result of two factors: First, accurately diagnosing AOM is difficult, even for experienced primary care or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians. Second, with a growing shortage of primary care physicians in the US, more Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants serve as first-line clinicians in primary care settings, but lack extensive training in otoscopy (i.e. clinical examination of the eardrum). Consequently, practitioners often err on the side of making a diagnosis of AOM and prescribing oral antibiotics. Over 8 million unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed annually, contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and creating the largest number of pediatric medication-related adverse events. Many children with inaccurate diagnoses of AOM are referred to ENTs for surgical placement of ear tubes, and up to 70% of these cases are not indicated. Diagnosing AOM still depends on clinician subjectivity, based on a brief glimpse of the eardrum. This diagnostic subjectivity creates a critical barrier to progress in society's goal of decreasing healthcare costs and reducing over-diagnosis and over-treatment of AOM. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2013, devices are needed to assist in more accurate, consistent, and objective diagnosis of AOM. A simple and objective method of analyzing an image of a patient's ear to diagnose or rule out AOM would drastically reduce over-treatment. This project will fill that gap, by developing computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) software that provides objective information to a clinician by analyzing eardrum images collected using currently available hardware. Based on previous work in applying similar methods to improve clinician performance in radiology and surgical pathology, our overarching hypothesis is that the incremental implementation of enhanced images, automated identification of abnormalities, and retrieval of similar cases will result in improved clinician diagnostic accuracy. In our preliminary work, we developed software, called Auto-Scope, which labels eardrums as “normal” versus “abnormal.” In this study, we propose two Specific Aims to improve diagnostic performance: Specific Aim #1: Create an enhanced composite image of the eardrum. Specific Aim #2: Use machine learning approaches for clinical decision support. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are generating new methods aimed at improving diagnostic quality and reducing inter-observer variability, which will ultimately enable more accurate diagnosis and personalized therapeutic approaches for ear abnormalities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission pertaining to the application of novel strategies that may improve human health, and NIDCD's mission of improving diagnosis and treatment of ear diseases, particularly otitis media.",Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology,9790958,R21DC016972,"['Academy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesteatoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cyst', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Ear Diseases', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hair', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nose', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otolaryngologist', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physician Assistants', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Tympanic membrane', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'acute infection', 'base', 'central database', 'clinical decision support', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'digital video recording', 'effusion', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized therapeutic', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'software development']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,199142,-0.009103758386045777
"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ampicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Fluids', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gentamicins', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Uropathogen', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'digital', 'genetic analysis', 'imaging capabilities', 'instrument', 'melting', 'microbial', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'success']",NIAID,"COMBINATI, INC.",R41,2019,224658,-0.030005954413810147
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry. This new technology will contribute to understanding complex processes in biological tissues that play a role in both health and disease.",Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry,9782980,UG3HL145593,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Blood capillaries', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Ensure', 'Glass', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slide', 'Solvents', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated analysis', 'biological systems', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'interest', 'ionization technique', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'nano', 'nanoprobe', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'preservation', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'scale up', 'tool']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,UG3,2019,375000,-0.01436511939321621
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9792960,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2019,667280,0.011104845663283444
"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",9882865,U24EB029011,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Psychology', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'medical implant', 'open source', 'outreach', 'particle', 'patient population', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2019,340827,0.006261487289421466
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",9746883,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,824785,0.005791992398933817
"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies,9746721,R01EB021900,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discipline', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peru', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'Underrepresented Students', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccines', 'Wait Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'community involvement', 'compliance behavior', 'data exchange', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'disadvantaged population', 'disease transmission', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'image processing', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'social', 'social inequality', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2019,334204,0.017751121565615962
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9750736,R01EB021396,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data pipeline', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2019,434944,0.01596931152997633
"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution. The work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease.","A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue",9894465,UH3CA246633,"['Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freeze Drying', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Granuloma', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'Morphology', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Readiness', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cohort', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'high dimensionality', 'high resolution imaging', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'ion source', 'learning strategy', 'multiplexed\xa0imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'reagent standardization', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UH3,2019,590000,-0.02500821831972114
"New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens Project Summary Over 600,000 bone marrow biopsies are performed every year in the United States, while hundreds of thousands more lymph node biospies are performed. Histological evaluation of these biopsies is a critical component of care for hematologic diseases including leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disease and non-neoplastic conditions such as viral infections and autoimmune conditions.  We have developed a platform that we consider a paradigm shift in the histologic examination of tissues. It is based on a new chemical process, imaging, and image processing approach that we have dubbed Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton microscopy (CHiMP).The CHiMP technology enables visual analysis of entire intact, un-embedded and uncut specimens within a short time-frame and with a resolution that is amenable to primary diagnosis. The significant clinical benefits include: 1) potential for same-day diagnosis, 2) labor and cost savings, 3) access to 3D perspective, 4) increased visual data from same specimen, 5) complete tissue preservation for ancillary studies such as DNA analysis and 6) inherent benefits of digital data such as reduced risk of loss, ready remote review by experts, and amenability to machine learning tools. Hematopoietic tissue evaluation would similarly benefit from these advantages, but unfortunately the systems developed thus far lack the resolution typically needed for visual examination of hematopoietic tissues.  For this Phase I SBIR proposal, an objective is to develop customized optics to improve the resolution of our current microscopes and thereby enable use in the specialized field of hematology. Commercially available objective lenses that are compatible with our immersion medium are either limited to numerical apertures (NA) that are less than one, affecting resolution and image quality, or have insufficient working distances for imaging past the coverslip and surface roughness to obtain complete sections. We will design and test a custom objective lens with high NA and long working distance, suited for our proprietary reagents. Integrating such a lens into our microscope will also require the design of a custom scan lens, custom beam conditioning optics, and a custom polygon scanner.  An associated goal is to develop a novel approach to preparing bone marrow aspiration specimens that will make them amenable to imaging with CHiMP, potentially reducing the need for core biopsies by permitting unambiguous morphologic categorization of cell subtypes in their architectural context, without the routine need for immunohistochemistry, and while preserving nucleic acids for molecular/genetic evaluation. Project Narrative Applikate Technologies has developed a powerful platform for histological evaluation of tissue called Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton Microscopy, or CHiMP. This platform has many advantages over traditional approaches, including same-day turn-around, reduced labor costs, preservation of tissue for DNA analysis, and direct-to-digital imaging for ease of consultation with remote experts. This proposal seeks to develop custom optics to enable very-high-resolution imaging of bone marrow and lymph node samples that are critical for diagnosing diseases such as leukemia and lymphoma.","New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens",9677952,R43CA235890,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Ancillary Study', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Aspiration', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Decalcification', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hematopathology', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Optics', 'Pan Genus', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'hematopoietic tissue', 'high resolution imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lens', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'medical specialties', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'preservation', 'second harmonic', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,"APPLIKATE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2019,224713,0.011845889186914324
"Deep LOGISMOS Abstract: This is a competitive continuation of a project that already yielded the highly flexible, accurate, and broadly applicable LOGISMOS framework for context-aware n-dimensional image segmentation. To substantially improve and extend its capability, we will develop Deep LOGISMOS that combines and reinforces the complementary advantages of LOGISMOS and deep learning (DL). There is growing need for quantitative failure-free 3D and higher-D image analysis for diagnostic and/or planning purposes. Examples of current use exist in radiation oncology, cardiology, ophthalmology and other areas of routine clinical medicine, many of which however still rely on manual slice-by-slice tracing. This manual nature of such analyses hinders their use in precision medicine. Deep LOGISMOS research proposed here will solve this problem and will offer routine efficient analysis of clinical images of analyzable quality. To stimulate a new phase of this research project, we hypothesize that: Advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms, when combined with deep-learning-derived application/modality specific parameters and allowing highly efficient expert-analyst guidance working in concert with the segmentation algorithms, will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired, complex, diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. The proposed research focuses on establishing an image segmentation and analysis framework combining the strengths of LOGISMOS and DL, developing a new way to efficiently generate training data necessary for learning from examples, forming a failure-free strategy for 3D, 4D, and generally n-D quantitative medical image analysis, and discovering ways for automated segmentation quality control. We will fulfill these specific aims:  1. Develop an efficient approach for building large segmentation training datasets in 3D, 4D, n-D  using assisted and suggestive annotations.  2. Develop Deep LOGISMOS, combining two well-established algorithmic strategies – deep learning  and LOGISMOS graph search.  3. Develop and validate methods employing deep learning for quality control of Deep LOGISMOS.  4. In healthcare-relevant applications, demonstrate that Deep LOGISMOS improves segmentation  performance in comparison with state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Deep LOGISMOS will bring broadly available routine quantification of clinical images, positively impacting the role of reliable image-based information in tomorrow’s precision medicine. Narrative: Previous phases of this successful research project were devoted to the development of new graph-based methods for multi-surface and/or multi-object multi-dimensional biomedical image segmentation. Deep learning is emerging as an important new way to learn from large sets of examples. This proposal will combine deep learning and graph-based image analysis to maximize their combined strengths and overcome their individual weaknesses with the overarching goal to facilitate routine use of quantitative medical image analysis techniques in personalized medical care.",Deep LOGISMOS,9831425,R01EB004640,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Ophthalmology', 'Organ', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Slice', 'Stroke', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'adjudication', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'diabetic', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macular edema', 'n-dimensional', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'success', 'task analysis', 'treatment planning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,409911,0.032821455531120786
"LATTICE: A Software Platform for Prospective and Retrospective Image Based Translational Research PROJECT SUMMARY Imaging forms the backbone of living subjects research. Living subjects research is both essential to the progress of translational medicine and very expensive. The research community actively seeks to develop and validate new clinical endpoints to solve a range of etiology, natural history, diagnostic and prognostic problems. This project aims to develop and commercialize LATTICE, an Electronic Research Record, Image Management and Sharing Solution, and Deep Learning Platform. LATTICE is designed to increase the efficiency of imaging-driven biomedical research and clinical trials. This efficiency is accomplished first through a structured workflow that includes protocol management, subject scheduling, and records collection from multiple imaging modalities. Access to imaging and associated data within the same workflow simplifies the process for the research team. Structuring the data into a de-identified, privacy-managed Image Bank enables sharing for collaboration and re-use for retrospective research. Image processing algorithms connected to the Image Bank facilitate batch analysis, while the system also provides a platform for the development of new image-based outcome measures and clinical endpoints. A key objective of LATTICE is to enable investigators and collaborators to accelerate the translation of insights to the clinic with maximum efficiency. Successful translation requires structuring the workflow, record keeping, and protocols into a rigorous, transparent, reproducible and validated process. LATTICE is designed to reduce the friction in translating successful research projects to the clinic. Researchers in the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP) at the Medical College of Wisconsin developed elements of LATTICE as separate technologies. The Specific Aims of this proposal are directed to an integrated workflow addressing a broader set of objectives. The AOIP LATTICE Electronic Research Record will be translated into a commercially managed repository and brought under regulatory Design Control. The current AOIP Image Bank containing 3,000,000 de- identified retinal images will be integrated into the LATTICE workflow. Critically, this integration will allow the sharing of the Image Bank with external researchers. Three retinal image process algorithms that operate on retinal images will integrate into this workflow. These algorithms include analysis of adaptive optics images of the fundus, analysis of the foveal avascular zone from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and model-based analysis of the fovea imaged with OCT. A computational deep learning workflow will also be prototyped using a cloud-based architecture. This final workflow will be constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of deploying a collaborative deep learning environment for the development of new clinical endpoints using shared, de-identified images. LATTICE will be a unique system for both prospective and retrospective translational research. LATTICE will make a profound impact on the cost of managing image-based research and add leverage to translational research expenditures for moving insights into the clinic. PROJECT NARRATIVE LATTICE is an innovative electronic research record and development platform for image-based ophthalmic research. LATTICE is designed to reduce the cost of translational research, promote the re- use of images, and simplify the development and application of new techniques to analyze medical images. LATTICE will integrate research workflow tools with a database of 3,000,000 retinal images and advanced image processing software to accelerate the process of translating eye research insights from the lab to the clinic.",LATTICE: A Software Platform for Prospective and Retrospective Image Based Translational Research,9777970,R43EY030408,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Expenditure', 'Eye', 'Friction', 'Future', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Image', 'Libraries', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Natural History', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Subjects', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Secure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Vertebral column', 'Wisconsin', 'Writing', 'adaptive optics', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'educational atmosphere', 'fovea centralis', 'fundus imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging program', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'ocular imaging', 'operation', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'retinal imaging', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'translational medicine', 'web services', 'wiki']",NEI,"TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING INNOVATIONS, INC.",R43,2019,299999,0.04148307955665658
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,9761481,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2019,873369,-0.0002830315470888017
"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies. With the proposed updates, not only will existing applications continue to provide advanced healthcare, but new, innovative medical applications will also be inspired.",Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK,9740493,R01EB014955,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Augmented Reality', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biometry', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cloud based', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'digital', 'health care delivery', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'open source', 'outreach', 'point of care', 'portability', 'processing speed', 'real world application', 'response', 'sensor', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend', 'virtual reality', 'web services']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2019,508446,-0.022156647924292443
"Neighborhood Looking Glass: 360 Degree Automated Characterization of the Built Environment for Neighborhood Effects Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal represents a vertical advancement in neighborhood effects research, producing for the first time, national neighborhood indicators of the built environment. Thus far, only local studies have been conducted due to the resource-intensive nature of site visits to conduct assessments of community features and also manual annotations of street images. With the recent advancement of computer vision and the emergence of massive sources of image data, we will leverage our team’s abilities to develop a data collection strategy utilizing geographic information systems to assemble a national collection of Google Street View images of all road intersections and street segments in the United States. We will utilize this data bank, and develop informatics algorithms to produce neighborhood summaries of built environment that have been theoretically and empirically identified to be important for health outcomes. After the creation of Neighborhood Looking Glass, we will conduct investigations into the impact of neighborhood environments on health utilizing medical records from hundreds of thousands of patients and accounting for predisposing characteristics in analyses. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, computer vision, bioinformatics, and computer science—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Develop informatics techniques to produce neighborhood quality indicators; 2) Measure the accuracy of data algorithms and construct an interactive geoportal for neighborhood data visualization and data sharing, 3) Utilize Neighborhood Looking Glass and a large collection of medical records from Intermountain Healthcare to investigate neighborhood influences on the risk of obesity and substance abuse. The epidemic rise in chronic health conditions is recent and as such suggests its cause is social, cultural, and constructed rather than purely biological. Thus, we have the possibility of intervening on the environment to better support health. Recent studies suggest that the current cohort of young adults may face historically high cardiovascular disease risk and chronic disease burden. Our substantive investigation of the impact of neighborhood factors on chronic conditions will contribute further to the understanding of contextual influences on the health of this cohort at the forefront of a chronic disease epidemic. Moreover, the dramatic rise in overdoses, accidental poisonings, and mental health issues contributing to premature mortality warrants further investigation into risk-inducing environmental factors for substance abuse. Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics. Results can be utilized to inform population-based strategies to reduce health disparities and improve health. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The epidemic rise in obesity, related chronic diseases, and substance abuse in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. The development of the Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics with potential impact on health.

"Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging methods are well-established in neuroscience, but high-speed, high- resolution volumetric imaging of neural activity in deep tissue remains a challenge. A number of techniques address limited aspects of this goal, and most are applicable primarily to acute preparations. We propose to develop and test a novel approach to achieve three-dimensional “deep-tissue” imaging for high spatial and temporal resolution neural recording by combining aspects of embedded optical probes with computational imaging techniques. Rather than use a single micro-endoscopic probe, we propose to utilize an array of narrower probes, or optrodes, to reduce the volume of tissue displacement. Computational imaging through each probe can be performed to achieve a field of view (FOV) at a desired distance from the probe tip. Combining the fields of view from multiple probes arranged in an array then provides a composite image field that is much larger than achievable from a single micro-endoscope. In our approach, each ∼0.1 mm diameter probe of the array acts as an independent micro- endoscope. In order to achieve full-field imaging across the array, the individual fields must intersect, and the computational method must be scaled to accommodate, and stitch, multiple fields. In pursuit of these goals, we propose three Aims: Optimizing the FOV of a single micro-endoscope - The purpose of this Aim is to characterize the FOV for an individual probe at multiple depths, and optimize the FOV to about 0.3mm through control over the shape of the probe tip and light collection numerical aperture. Accelerating calibration and reconstruction - In this Aim, we will pursue efficient computational approaches for calibration based upon ray-tracing simulations and image reconstruction based on deep learning. Scaling the FOV with an endoscope array - The computational image reconstruction method will be scaled to accommodate small micro-endoscope arrays (e.g. 4 element) arranged in a hexagonal lattice with FOV of 0.6mm at a 1.5mm depth. NARRATIVE Imaging deep inside tissue, including the brain, is critical to understanding various biological processes. Doing so through a small probe is also of primary importance for minimizing tissue damage. In this proposal, we apply computational techniques to create fluorescent images using an array of microscopic glass needles to guide light in and out of a mouse brain. The simplicity and small footprint of our system have the potential for deep-brain imaging (depths > 1.5 mm) across a large (mm) field of view, which should enable a wide variety of biological and neuroscience studies in the future.",Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging,9829467,R21EY030717,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Coupled', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Endoscopes', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescent Probes', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Miniaturization', 'Mus', 'Needles', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Penetration', 'Preparation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'absorption', 'adaptive optics', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'lens', 'microendoscope', 'multi-photon', 'neural circuit', 'novel strategies', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal rods', 'simulation', 'temporal measurement']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,456800,-0.001595075155432956
"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9653180,R01EY025332,"['3-Dimensional', 'Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,416574,0.005271966283630947
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest.

"A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to improve our ability to create and measure 3D models derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Our main motivation is to improve quality and reduce costs in care of patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities. The resulted innovations will also impact other fields. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffered from CMF deformities. The evaluation of these patients includes an assessment of CMF form on 3D models that are traditionally generated from segmented spiral multi-slice CTs (MSCTs). These models are also used to plan their treatment. The purpose of segmentation is to separate different anatomical structures and to remove the artifacts on the CTs. Once 3D models are generated from the segmented CTs, anatomical and teeth landmarks are manually digitized for measurements. Finally, diagnosis and treatment planning are performed based on measurements. Although MSCT provides high- quality images and thus allows relatively fast and easy post processing, many concerns have been raised on excessive radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, more doctors are now using CBCT scanners in their offices. CBCT has less radiation and is inexpensive compared to the MSCT, but their use in generating 3D models is greatly limited by the poor image quality, i.e., low contrast / signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts. Thus, the existing automated segmentation algorithms developed for MSCT are incapable of practically segmenting CBCTs. The current solution to CBCT segmentation entails an arduous and lengthy process that involves labor-intensive manual editing of hundreds of slices. Besides, another arduous and inaccurate task in the assessment of CMF deformities is the digitization of anatomical landmarks on 3D models - the first step to quantify the deformities. Currently a typical 3D cephalometric and teeth analysis requires the manual digitization of more than 200 landmarks, which is time consuming and has limited accuracy. We hypothesize that the creation and measurement of high-quality 3D models can be significantly improved by developing innovative CBCT-friendly post processing tools. Therefore, in this renewal project, we propose to develop and validate a novel CBCT analysis platform to automate the process of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization. The feasibility of our approaches has already been proven by our preliminary studies. Our innovative CBCT analysis platform will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals with CMF conditions. It will change our dental/CMF fields in effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for on-the-fly diagnosis and treatment planning. With minimal user intervention, the computer will accurately and effectively do the work, which is currently artistically done by the labor-intensive human operators. The resulted innovations may also impact other fields in the future, e.g., orthopedic surgery and cardiovascular surgery where intraoperative whole-body CBCT is acquired for image-guided surgery and intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in physician's offices for orthodontics, craniomaxillofacial (CMF) surgery, facial plastic surgery and dentistry, but its segmentation and landmark digitization have to be completed artistically by human operators, which is labor-intensive and with limited accuracy.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative CBCT post processing system to automate the processes of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization with minimal user intervention.  The proposed system will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals  with CMF conditions, and also change 1) the fields of orthodontics, CMF surgery and general dentistry in  effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for diagnosis and treatment planning, and 2) the fields of orthopedic  surgery, general surgery, and cardiovascular surgery where the quality and the speed of intraoperative  imaging is critical.",A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities,9624752,R01DE022676,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Deformity', 'Dental Care', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Jaw', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Orthodontics', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'design', 'detector', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,490358,-0.004920537307696824

"Development of a computer-guided orthopedic laser surgical system – vision & measurement Spatial Surgical is developing a novel, first-in-class orthopedic laser system that rapidly and safely ablates soft tissue and bone through a single handpiece. Spatial’s technology couples a laser with a real-time digital video system to offer computer-guided surgery that stands to replace traditional orthopedic saws, drills, and cauterization tools. The digital 3D video system is two miniaturized CMOS-based cameras built into the laser hand- piece. By eliminating mechanical tools an unobstructed, intra-operative view of the surgical site is possible for the first time ever. In-between the laser pulses, the cameras flash to capture an unobstructed view of the surgical site. The dual cameras are connected to a 3D display. Advances in autostereoscopic 3D displays have eliminated the need for 3D glasses, referred to as “glasses-free”, and enabled wide angle viewing. 3D viewing of the surgical area promotes increased spatial understanding of complex/ambiguous scenes and enhances surgical efficiency (McIntire 2014). Coupling image recognition software with the 3D vision enables AI measurement and computer assisted navigation. Orthopedic surgical success, measured as less patient pain and fewer revisions, has been shown when measurement and navigation are used, but existing systems are expensive and slow. A laser surgical hand-piece coupled with HD 3D vision and measurement will enable more accurate implant placement and restored range of motion while reducing infections and decreasing surgical times. This SBIR program models, tests, and demonstrates 3D viewing including digital zoom. Initially a multi-element design is modeled to predict what lens assembles would match with the digital CMOS imager appropriate for the orthopedic HD 3D application. Secondly off-the-shelf, OTS, lens stacks are chosen based on the optical modeling, and are tested to define the balance between the FOV, focal length, object distance and image size. Lens stack stereo characteristics are recorded and subsequently derive the forward-looking design requirements. Additionally, various illumination levels are explored to determine the optimum lighting for each lens stack. A standard vision calibration chart, like Mil-Std-150A, is used for alignment and the edge response is used to define spatial resolution. Multiple bone cut samples are measured with a confocal microscope and then viewed in 2D with the various OTS lens stacks. Optical measurement software is used to process the OTS lens camera images and are graphed versus the microscope data to determine peak image performance for spatial resolution. The introduction of HD autostereoscopic monitors and high pixel count CMOS global imagers enable a 3D surgical vision system to aid in orthopedic surgical applications by providing 3D glasses-free and wide angle viewing to improve spatial understanding of joints for faster and more precise surgery.",Development of a computer-guided orthopedic laser surgical system – vision & measurement,9846664,R43AR075447,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Budgets', 'Calibration', 'Cauterize', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Surgery', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Fracture', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Implantation procedure', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'base', 'bone', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'lens', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'preservation', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'solid state', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAMS,SPATIAL SURGICAL LLC,R43,2019,246510,0.018111715509426623
"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features.

"SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING EMAN is one of the most well-established and widely used scientific image processing suites targeting the rapidly growing CryoEM/CryoET community worldwide. In turn, the CryoEM and CryoET studies which it enables permit determination of the structures of interacting macromolecules both in-vitro and in-vivo, and are being used to better understand the biochemical processes taking place in cells, to better identify potential drug targets and develop novel diagnostics. With the higher resolutions now possible in this field, direct drug interaction structural studies are now possible, and being used to gain insight into the mode of action of drugs within the cell. Unlike many newer tools in the field, such as Relion, CisTEM and CryoSparc, which focus on specific refinement tasks, EMAN is a versatile, modular suite capable of performing a variety of image processing tasks with hundreds of algorithms supporting virtually all of the standard file formats and mathematical conventions used in the field, as well as other related imaging fields. It provides an ideal platform for prototyping fundamental new algorithm developments, while still able to achieve data-limited resolution in single particle reconstruction. While high resolution single particle refinement has become routine in recent years, thanks largely to the dramatic data quality improvements provided by new detector technology, there remain significant opportunities for improvements in mitigating model bias, efficient use of data, and analysis of complexes with compositional or conformational variability. Some of the most important problems from a biological perspective involve the sort of compositional and conformational variability which remain challenging problems. The field also remains susceptible to problems of initial model bias, which are exacerbated in systems exhibiting structural variability, and as a result many structures are still published with exaggerated resolution claims. The standard protocols used by many in the field typically involve discarding a very large fraction of the raw data (as much as 80-90% in some cases), often based on qualitative assessments, raising questions related to rigor and reproducibility of structural results. In this proposal, we will develop or adapt image processing techniques to help resolve these issues, based on developments or unrealized concepts from mathematics and computer science. CryoEM and CryoET are used to study the structures of interacting biomolecules in the cell at resolutions 100x better than the best possible light microscope. This methodology permits new insights into the biomolecules which underlie disease, can shed light on structural changes in diseased cells and provide direct information on how drugs interact with the molecules they target.

"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9784742,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data pipeline', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,533529,0.02254113798227515
"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9600285,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,194115,0.027835613795447724
"Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery Abstract  Development of emerging imaging systems for biological and medical imaging often involves multi-dimensional acquisition protocols and thus correspondingly the need for complex reconstruction algorithms and advanced machine learning algorithms in order to produce the desired resulting image and quantitative tumor characteristics. This proposal requests funding for a high performance computing system, entitled Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery, to further the development and application of deep learning techniques to quantitative image analysis and image reconstruction. There are 12 specific NIH projects that will benefit from the proposed computing infrastructure system. We present the 12 projects through examples from within four Specific Research Topics areas: (a) tomographic image reconstruction, (b) quantitative image analysis, (c) functional quantification, and (d) association of radiomics (image data) with phenotypic and genomic data. The proposed system is a computing cluster, which uses ScaleMP's Versatile SMP software to aggregate the cluster nodes into a single symmetric multiprocessing computer.

"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9521289,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,471965,-0.016673784105916807
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"Naturalistic Data Collection In The SmartPlayroom PROJECT SUMMARY The aims of this proposal are to fully develop and validate the SmartPlayroom as a powerful automated data collection and analysis tool in developmental research. This room looks like any playroom in a home or school but is designed to naturalistically collect data in real time and simultaneously on all aspects of children's behavior. Behaviors include movement kinematics, language, eye movements, and social interaction while a child performs naturalistic tasks, plays and explores without instruction, walks or crawls, and interacts with a caregiver. The space is equipped with mobile eye tracking, wireless physiological heart rate and galvanic skin response sensors, audio and video recording, and depth sensor technologies. Funding is requested to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement using an example from visual attention research (Aim 1), and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use in 4-9 year-old children (Aim 2). By combining fine-grained sensor data with high-throughput automated computer vision and machine learning tools, we will be able to automate quantitative data collection and analysis in the SmartPlayroom for use in addressing myriad developmental questions. The SmartPlayroom approach overcomes completely the limitations of task-based experimentation in developmental research, offering quantitative precision in the collection of ecologically valid data. It has the power to magnify both construct validity and measurement reliability in developmental research. The investigators are committed to making freely available our data, computer vision algorithms, and discoveries so that we might move the field forward quickly. NARRATIVE We focus this work on developing and validating a novel and innovative data collection space called the SmartPlayroom, designed to pair naturalistic exploration and action with the precision of computerized automated data collection and analysis.

"Extracting rich information from biological images Project Summary  Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image samples. Whether in small­ or large­scale microscopy experiments, biologists increasingly need software to identify and measure cells and other biological entities in images, to improve speed, objectivity, and/or statistical power.  The principal investigator envisions bringing transformative image analysis and machine learning algorithms and software to a wide swath of biomedical researchers. In a decade, researchers will tackle fundamentally new problems with quantitative image analysis, using seamless imaging workflows that have dramatic new capabilities going beyond the constraints of human vision.  To this end, the PI will collaborate with biologists on important quantitative imaging projects that also yield major advancements to their open­source image analysis software, CellProfiler. This versatile, user­friendly software is indispensable for biomedical research. Launched 125,000+ times/year worldwide, it is cited in 3,400+ papers from 1,000+ laboratories, impacting a huge variety of biomedical fields via assays from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning. CellProfiler evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment that has yielded dozens of discoveries and several potential drugs.  Still, many biologists are missing out on the quantitative bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and usable software for their needs. In addition to maintaining and supporting CellProfiler, the team will implement biologist­requested features, algorithms, and interoperability to cope with the changing land­ scape of microscopy experiments. Challenges include increases in scale (sometimes millions of images), size (20+ GB images), and dimensionality (time­lapse, three­dimensional, multi­spectral). Researchers also need to accommodate a variety of modalities (super­resolution, single­molecule, and others) and integrate image analysis into complex workflows with other software for microscope control, cloud computing, and data mining.  The PI will also pioneer novel algorithms and approaches changing the way images are used in biology, including: (1) a fundamental redesign of the image processing workflow for biologists, leveraging revolutionary advancements in deep learning, (2) image analysis for more physiologically relevant systems, such as model organisms, human tissue samples, and patient­derived cultures, and (3) data visualization and interpretation software for high­dimensional single­cell morphological profiling. In profiling, subtle patterns of morphological changes in cells are detected to identify causes and treatments for various diseases. We will also (4) integrate multiple profiling data types: morphology with gene expression, epigenetics, and proteomics. Ultimately, we aim to make perturbations in cell morphology as computable as other large­scale functional genomics data.  Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high­impact discoveries from microscopy images, and its software will enable hundreds of other NIH­funded laboratories to do the same, across all biological disciplines. Public Health Relevance/Narrative Modern microscopy experiments are increasing in scale and scope; the research will result in pioneering computational techniques and software that will change the way microscopy images are used in biology. Biologists will use the resulting software to tackle fundamentally new problems using quantitative image analysis, including detecting changes in the appearance of cells that are overlooked by human vision and studying intact organisms and human tissue rather than isolated cells.

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9518217,R01HL142036,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual clinical trial']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,392932,0.025243108170767276
"Image analytics prediction of corneal keratoplasty failure Image analytics for prediction of keratoplasty failure Summary We will create specialized image analytics software for prediction of keratoplasty (penetrating, endothelial) fail- ure from specular-reflection corneal endothelial cell (EC) images. Keratoplasties are the most common tissue transplant, with roughly a 10% failure rate, leading to blindness, patient discomfort/anxiety, and repeat kerato- plasties with a higher chance for failure than the initial procedure. With successful predictive image analytics, we will be in a position to identify transplanted corneas at risk and possibly treat them more aggressively with topical corticosteroids or other measures to prevent failure. Since a functional endothelial cell (EC) layer is necessary for the active ionic-pump-driven redistribution of fluid necessary to maintain the clear cornea, EC images have been analyzed as an indicator of cornea health. The normal EC layer exhibits high cell density arranged in a predominantly regular, hexagonal array. We will build on the use of existing quantitative bi- omarkers from EC images (EC density, coefficient of variation of cell areas, and hexagonality) used to evaluate cornea health. We will compute additional image features associated with local and long-range cell disarray, image attributes relevant to keratoplasty rejection, and traditional features from computer vision. Including this combination of features will provide rich inputs to machine-learning classifiers aimed at predicting future out- comes (e.g., failure or no failure). We will apply methods to a large aggregation of well-curated data from pre- vious NIH-funded studies at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and from previous studies at the Neth- erlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery (NIIOS). Our team consists of image processing experts, oph- thalmologists, and staff from the CWRU Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and University Hospitals (UH) Eye Institute’s Cornea Image Analysis Reading Center (CIARC), which is well-known for rigor- ous, highly repeatable assessment of conventional quantitative biomarkers in a large number of multi- institutional clinical trials. Together, our goal will be to determine if this “second generation” analysis of EC im- ages can lead to prediction of keratoplasty failure. If successful, this project will lead to software which can be translated to support research and clinical practice. Narrative Our goal is to create image analytic software that will predict the risk of keratoplasty failure from readily ob- tained corneal endothelial cell images. With knowledge of eyes at risk, physicians will be able to tailor treat- ments to improve cornea transplant success, thereby very positively impacting patients’ health.",Image analytics prediction of corneal keratoplasty failure,9592472,R21EY029498,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Cell Density', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Companions', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Endothelium', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descemet&apos', 's membrane', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Intraocular lens implant device', 'Intuition', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Netherlands', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetrating Keratoplasty', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Pump', 'Reading', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Software Framework', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Topical Corticosteroids', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical practice', 'data management', 'density', 'experimental study', 'hazard', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'validation studies', 'vision science']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,240000,0.016464155062861356
"Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data This project aims to develop NeuroManager™, an innovative neuroinformatics platform for advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data. A core technology that we will develop in NeuroManager will be Image Content Analysis for Retrieval Using Semantics (ICARUS), a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable image retrieval based on visual appearance or by semantic concept. ICARUS will use machine learning applied to content-based image retrieval (CBIR) to build and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign semantic concepts to neuroimages. Neuroscience research generates extensive, multifaceted data that is considerably under-utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source lab. On the other hand, there are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results. Unfortunately, none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. To solve this problem, NeuroManager will include the following distinct, significant innovations: (i) versatility for handling two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humans; (ii) functionality to share complex datasets that extends secure, privacy-controlled paradigms from institutional, laboratory-based and even public domains; (iii) flexibility to implement NeuroManager within an institute’s IT infrastructure, or on most cloud-based virtualized environments including Azure, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services; (iv) and most importantly, the ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data sets. The benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be to foster collaboration between scientists and institutions, promoting innovation through combined expertise in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. This will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levels (i.e., macroscopically, microscopically, subcellularly and functionally), ultimately leading to an improved basis for developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will prove feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR on 2D whole slide images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaborators. Work in Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations mentioned above. A competing technology with comparable functionality, addressing the full breadth of needs for modern neuroscience research, is currently not available commercially or otherwise. Narrative There are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results; however none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists.

"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user’s location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user’s location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user’s trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings. The proposed research would result in a new smartphone-based wayfinding app that could greatly increase travel independence for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,9499823,R01EY029033,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cost Measures', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elevator', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Indoor environment', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Needs Assessment', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Schools', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'interest', 'lens', 'meetings', 'open source', 'radiofrequency', 'sensor', 'way finding', 'wireless fidelity']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,416374,-0.026098720605725035
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9659850,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,593526,-0.012337270127381995
"SCH:Smartphone Wound Image Parameter Analysis and Decision Support in Mobile Env PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the U.S., with an estimated treatment cost of $25 billion. Our team proposes research to advance our existing NSF-funded smartphone wound analysis system, which helps patients monitor their diabetic foot ulcers, providing them with instant feedback on healing progress. Our wound system analyzes a smartphone image of the patients' wound, detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score by comparing the current image with a past image. Our envisioned chronic wound assessment system will support evidence-based decisions by the care team while visiting patients, and move wound care toward digital objectivity. We define digital objectivity as the synthesis of wound assessment metrics that are extracted autonomously from images in order to generate objective actionable feedback, enabling clinicians not trained as wound specialists to deliver ""standardized wound care"". Digital objectivity contrasts with the current practice of subjective, visual inspection of wounds based on physician experience. The first aim will develop image processing algorithms to mitigate wound analysis errors caused by non-ideal lighting in some clinical or home settings, and when the wound is photographed from arbitrary camera angles and distance. While our previous wound system worked well in ideal conditions, non-ideal lighting caused large errors and healthy skin was detected as the wound area in extreme cases. The second aim extends our existing wound analysis system that targets only diabetic wounds to handle arterial, venous and pressure ulcers, expanding the potential user. The third aim will synthesize algorithms that autonomously generate actionable wound decision rules that are learned from decisions taken by actual wound clinicians. This research is joint work of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) (technical expertise in image processing, machine learning and smartphone programming) and University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) (clinical expertise on wounds, and wound patient recruitment to validate our work) RELEVANCE (See instructions): We propose research to advance our existing smartphone wound analysis system, which detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score from a wound image.

"Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification The purpose of flow cytometers is to enable the classification of cells or organisms at high throughput. Label-free optical flow cytometers not based on fluorescence are generally based on scattering. The most common of these compares the amount of forward (FS) versus side (SS) scattering. Such two-parameter information permits rudimentary classification based on size or granularity, but it misses more subtle features that can be critical in defining organism identity. Nevertheless, FS/SS flow cytometry remains popular, largely because of its simplicity and capacity for high throughput.  We propose to develop a label-free computational flow cytometer that preserves much of the simplicity and high-throughput capacity of FS/SS flow cytometry, but provides significantly enhanced information. Instead of characterizing organisms based on scattering direction (as does FS/SS flow cytometry), we will characterize based on scattering patterns. We will insert a reconfigurable diffractive element in the imaging optics of a flow cytometer to route user-defined basis patterns to independent detectors. The basis patterns will be optimally matched to specific sample features. The respective weights of these basis patterns will serve as signatures to identify organisms of interest. The basis patterns themselves will be determined by machine learning algorithms. Both the device and the learning algorithms will be developed from scratch.  We anticipate that our flow cytometer will be able to operate at flow rates on the order of meters per second, commensurate with state-of-the-art FS/SS flow cytometers, while providing significantly more information for improved classification capacity. While our technique should be advantageous for any label-free flow cytometry application requiring high throughput, we will test it here by demonstrating high-throughput classification of microbial communities. NARRATIVE Our goal is to improve the information extraction capacity of label-free flow cytometers, while maintaining high throughput capacity. As such, our device should have a broad range of applications.",Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification,9510096,R21GM128020,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pupil', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'interest', 'meter', 'microbial community', 'microorganism', 'microorganism classification', 'optical imaging', 'prototype', 'recruit']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2018,239527,-0.001284625856275011

"Quantifying NETosis via Automated High Content Imaging Convolutional Neural Networks PROJECT SUMMARY NETosis was identified as a distinct mode of cell death in neutrophils more than a decade ago. Dysregulation of NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of human pathologies such as preeclampsia, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, cystic fibrosis, lupus nephritis, and coagulopathies that include cancer-associated thrombosis. The literature consistently cites the lack of a standardized methodology for quantitation of NETosis as an impediment to basic and translational research. Thus, the premise is that there is a compelling, unmet need for a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis to accelerate neutrophil and inflammation-based research and facilitate the discovery and development of therapeutic compounds. The scope of this STTR project is to develop a high-throughput image analysis and quantitation method by using high content imaging and the revolutionary technology of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the identification and quantitation of NETosis in human neutrophils. The target readout is based on the primary morphological difference between NETotic and non-NETotic nuclei--the decondensation of chromatin. This image-based quantitative method will be observer-independent and will enable robust and rapid evaluation of a large number of samples that would exceed any attempts at manual assessment. In Phase I we will complete the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Optimize and standardize the high- throughput platform for quantitation of NETosis in adherent human neutrophils. This includes standard assay optimization procedures, training the CNN to identify and quantitate NETotic neutrophil, and demonstrating that the CNN reliably distinguishes between necrosis and NETosis, whose phenotypes appear similar to the human eye. Aim 2: Validate the NETosis assay biochemically and clinically. This includes concentration-response assays with NETosis agonists, assessment of NETosis inhibitors, and evaluation of the NETotic status of Sickle Cell Disease patient samples (a disease in which aberrant NETosis has been implicated). The expected outcome of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate proof-of-concept for this automated high- throughput NETosis assay. Further, we expect to provide insight into the utility of the assay for assessment of inhibitors of NETosis as therapeutic agents. Upon completion of our Phase I aims, our Phase II program will focus on further optimizing and validating this NETosis assay and preparing it for commercialization.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The lack of a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis is impeding basic and translational research. We have developed a high-throughput assay using convolutional neural networks to quantify NETosis in human neutrophils.

"Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology ABSTRACT Acute infections of the middle ear (acute otitis media - AOM), are the most commonly treated childhood disease. Treatment is fueled by concern for complications and effects on children's cognitive and language development. The financial burden of AOM is estimated at more than $5 billion per year. Because AOM is so common, a major societal problem is the over-diagnosis and over-treatment of this disease, as a result of two factors: First, accurately diagnosing AOM is difficult, even for experienced primary care or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians. Second, with a growing shortage of primary care physicians in the US, more Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants serve as first-line clinicians in primary care settings, but lack extensive training in otoscopy (i.e. clinical examination of the eardrum). Consequently, practitioners often err on the side of making a diagnosis of AOM and prescribing oral antibiotics. Over 8 million unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed annually, contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and creating the largest number of pediatric medication-related adverse events. Many children with inaccurate diagnoses of AOM are referred to ENTs for surgical placement of ear tubes, and up to 70% of these cases are not indicated. Diagnosing AOM still depends on clinician subjectivity, based on a brief glimpse of the eardrum. This diagnostic subjectivity creates a critical barrier to progress in society's goal of decreasing healthcare costs and reducing over-diagnosis and over-treatment of AOM. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2013, devices are needed to assist in more accurate, consistent, and objective diagnosis of AOM. A simple and objective method of analyzing an image of a patient's ear to diagnose or rule out AOM would drastically reduce over-treatment. This project will fill that gap, by developing computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) software that provides objective information to a clinician by analyzing eardrum images collected using currently available hardware. Based on previous work in applying similar methods to improve clinician performance in radiology and surgical pathology, our overarching hypothesis is that the incremental implementation of enhanced images, automated identification of abnormalities, and retrieval of similar cases will result in improved clinician diagnostic accuracy. In our preliminary work, we developed software, called Auto-Scope, which labels eardrums as “normal” versus “abnormal.” In this study, we propose two Specific Aims to improve diagnostic performance: Specific Aim #1: Create an enhanced composite image of the eardrum. Specific Aim #2: Use machine learning approaches for clinical decision support. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are generating new methods aimed at improving diagnostic quality and reducing inter-observer variability, which will ultimately enable more accurate diagnosis and personalized therapeutic approaches for ear abnormalities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission pertaining to the application of novel strategies that may improve human health, and NIDCD's mission of improving diagnosis and treatment of ear diseases, particularly otitis media.",Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology,9669491,R21DC016972,"['Academy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesteatoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cyst', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Ear Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hair', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nose', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otolaryngologist', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physician Assistants', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Tympanic membrane', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'acute infection', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'digital video recording', 'effusion', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized therapeutic', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'software development']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,252169,-0.009103758386045777
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,9577245,R01AI138993,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Arizona', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Cells', 'Care Technology Points', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Face', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Health Care', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virotherapy', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'density', 'design', 'health care settings', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'light scattering', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'technology development', 'technology validation']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2018,1329765,-0.028987574360714887
"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9560761,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2018,179876,-0.0248487262585728
"2018 Image Science Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary: The proposal requests support for early-career investigators to attend the 2018 Gordon Research Conference on Image Science. The unique feature of this conference in its third offering compared with others in medical imaging is the bringing together of renown speakers from disparate application areas, including astronomy, biology, medicine, remote sensing, and security and defense industries, in a forum that encourages each to describe their greatest challenges and most promising solutions. All speakers are invited based on their leadership in their field and their willingness to debate fundamental issues shared by everyone developing, evaluating, and applying imaging in medicine and biology. We believe the GRC format placed in the context of a small-college venue promotes the type of innovative interdisciplinary thinking that leads to breakthroughs. An environment where leading senior scientists debate core issues is valuable to young investigators trying to build successful independent careers in medical imaging in industry and academia. All attendees are invited to present a poster describing their research in poster sessions that are a key element of the Gordon Conference format. The June 17-22, 2018 GRC conference theme is “Image Science: Creating Knowledge from Information,” which is focused on appropriate acquisition and efficient uses of the massive volume of imaging information now collected from patients. Speakers give 40 minutes presentations in a single-track format with 20 minute discussions following each presentation that are led by experts in the field. Topic range from “Imaging in Brain Science Discovery” to “Advanced Machine Learning” and “Computational Imaging.” At the center of each presentation is a discussion of the core challenges shared by image scientists and novel techniques for acquiring and displaying information in a manner that maximizes decision performance. Given the success of the previous meeting, we will hold the first-ever, student-run Gordon Research Seminars (GRS) on Image Science June 16, 17, 2018. Our aim is to build Image Science as an independent field of study through detailed interdisciplinary discussions and by fostering the success of a new generation of image scientists. Project Narrative: Solutions to very difficult problems often emerge from discussions among experts in different fields of study being challenged by the same core problems. The 2018 GRC on Imaging Science strives to build a community of problem solvers by creating an environment for detailed discussions among senior investigators that involves young investigators at a time when they are building careers.

Two of these meetings, Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy (OTS) and Microscopy, Histopathology and Analytics (Microscopy) provide broad exposure to a very active multidisciplinary field in biomedical imaging and bioengineering focused on illness treatment and health enhancement. The interdisciplinary nature of the co- located meetings will provide cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between fields with the resulting synergies obtained from such interactions. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students and early career professionals presenting at one of these topical meetings.  OTS will focus on new developments in diffuse optics, spectroscopy and other non- invasive tomographic imaging approaches, including the fields of diffuse optical tomography (DOT), photoacoustic tomography (PAT), optical coherence tomography (OCT), wavefront engineering to overcome scattering, as well as new developments in spectroscopic technologies.  Microscopy will include topics central to the development of optical microscopy and in vitro optical sensing for the clinic. Areas such as novel optical approaches, including computational optics, new image processing and segmentation techniques, development of decision-assistance algorithms via machine-learning and other strategies, testing technologies in pre-clinical models, applications to clinical samples, and validation in the clinic will be discussed. Optically enabled microfluidics are included in this track as well. The goal of these efforts should be towards clinical translation.  The general purpose of these meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events.

"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large mutli-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several open-source software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA and BD2K funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements that called for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for multi-site QC workflows as that would require a unified platform, design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that supports simplified creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific findings findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site open-source software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (mIQa) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system, machine learning to aid in QC process, and an interactive electronic notebook platform. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automating notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, mIQa is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study.

"An integrated neural network analysis and video microscopy platform for fully automated particle tracking Project Summary/Abstract  Particle tracking (PT) is a biophysical tool for elucidating molecular interactions, transport phenomena of diverse species, and rheological properties of complex materials. PT experiments involve first obtaining high resolution videos that capture time-resolved increments of particles, followed by extraction of traces of entities of interest from videos in the form of spatial locations over time, a process we refer to as path conversion. Finally, quantitative analysis of the traces will yield diffusivities, viscoelasticity, etc.  Lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and COPD, are characterized by a highly viscoelastic mucus layer that is incapable of being cleared by mucociliary clearance. Not surprisingly, the viscoelasticity of mucus often directly reflects disease progression. A variety of mucolytics are being investigated, but due to the variable composition and properties of mucus between patients, effective mucolytics treatment will likely be different between individuals; too little/inappropriate mucolytics will not be effective in restoring mucus clearance, whereas too much may result in bronchorrhea. Although microbeads-based rheology has been performed on a variety of mucus specimens in basic research, the capacity for high throughput characterization of rheological properties of biological specimens in a clinical setting is currently not available. This limitation can be attributed to inefficiencies of path conversion: current PT software requires extensive human supervision/intervention to achieve accurate path conversion, not only resulting in poor reproducibility and throughput but also restricting its use to only expert labs. Our vision is to make PT as objective and easy to use as a simple plate reader that can be readily utilized by clinicians (diagnostics, disease progression, therapy effectiveness), pharma (preclinical/clinical drug screening), and research professionals. Towards this goal, we have created a neural network tracker (NNT) that automatically determines the location of all particles in each frame with zero user-input (i.e. no parameter for users to change), and retains the identity of all particles from frame to frame. The innovation is that NNT can robustly, reproducibly, and accurately track a wide range of 2D/3D videos with virtually no need for human intervention, achieving unparalleled time savings. We have already successfully deployed NNT over the Google cloud, which offers exceptional scalability. Nevertheless, for time-sensitive applications, such as an automated PT rheometer, the transfer of large video data files is likely prohibitive. Therefore, in this Phase I STTR, we seek to enable real-time NNT-based PT analysis on the local machine while video microscopy data is being acquired by the microscope, and allow data from PT analysis to drive the operation of the microscope. In Aim 1, we will integrate our NNT with a single objective fluorescence microscope system called Monoptes. Aim 2 will evaluate the performance of our NNT- Monoptes system. If successful, our technology would form the basis of a fully automated PT system capable of measuring rheological properties of fluids/materials or distribution of particle sizes in a 96-well plate format. Project Narrative Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool in life and physical sciences, but unfortunately, its application has been strongly limited by inefficiencies in accurately extracting particle traces from raw movies. Unlike conventional particle tracking methods, we have combined artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a software that can consistently provide superior and truly automated tracking performance compared to current alternatives. In this proposal, we will integrate this latest advance with sophisticated instrumentation to develop a microscope system capable of fully automated particle tracking microscopy in a 96-well plate format. If successful, the instrument will likely be utilized by clinicians (diagnostics, disease progression, therapy effectiveness), pharma (preclinical/clinical drug screening of patients), and research professionals.",An integrated neural network analysis and video microscopy platform for fully automated particle tracking,9620574,R41GM130202,"['Acceleration', 'Adopted', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Screening', 'Effectiveness', 'Elasticity', 'Engineering', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'HIV Infections', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Microspheres', 'Motion', 'Mucociliary Clearance', 'Mucolytics', 'Mucous body substance', 'Output', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rheology', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Series', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Spottings', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Video Microscopy', 'Viscosity', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'base', 'biophysical tools', 'cloud based', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence microscope', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'movie', 'novel', 'operation', 'particle', 'patient screening', 'physical science', 'pre-clinical', 'submicron', 'virtual', 'viscoelasticity']",NIGMS,"AI TRACKING SOLUTIONS, LLC",R41,2018,224894,-0.00398859656416139
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9535994,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2018,444363,0.01596931152997633
"Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is diagnosed in approximately 124,000 people and is responsible for about 10,000 deaths every year, in the USA. Dermatologists rely on visual and dermatoscopic examination to discriminate benign melanocytic lesions from malignant, resulting in high and highly variable benign-to-malignant biopsy ratios from 8:1 to 47:1, and millions of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging has been proven for noninvasively guiding diagnosis of melanoma in several large clinical studies. RCM imaging at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) provides sensitivity of 92-88% and specificity of 71-84%. The specificity is 2 times superior to that of dermatoscopy. RCM imaging at the DEJ is now being implemented to rule out malignancy, reduce biopsy and guide treatment. However, this is currently at only a few sites, where there are highly trained experts who can ensure that imaging is appropriately performed and images are read correctly. These experts are a small international cohort of ""early adopter"" clinicians, who have worked with RCM technology during the past decade and have become highly skilled readers. For novice (non-expert) clinicians in the wider cohort who are keen to adopt RCM, learning to read images is challenging and requires substantial effort and time. Two major technical barriers underlie the dramatic variability in diagnostic accuracy among novice clinicians. Together they limit utility, reproducibility and wider adoption of RCM. The first is user dependent subjective variability in depths near the DEJ at which images are acquired, and the second is variability in interpretation of images. We propose to address these barriers with computational ""multi-faceted"" classification modeling (innovation), image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop and evaluate algorithms for both dermatoscopic images and RCM depth-stacks, to enable automated standardized and consistent acquisition of RCM mosaics at the DEJ in melanocytic lesions; (2) to develop and evaluate algorithms to discriminate patterns of cellular morphology at the DEJ into two classes, benign lesions versus malignant (dysplastic lesions and melanoma); and (3) to test our algorithms on patients for acquisition of RCM mosaics and classification into those two groups, with statistical validation against pathology, with statistical validation against pathology. Preliminary studies show that our algorithms can delineate the DEJ with accuracy in the range ~3-13 μm in strongly pigmented dark skin and ~5-20 μm in lightly pigmented fair skin, and can detect cellular morphologic patterns with sensitivity in the range 67-80% and specificity 78-99%. Melanocytic lesions can be distinguished from the surrounding normal skin at the DEJ with 80% classification accuracy. We are a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and University of Modena. Our success will produce standardized imaging and analysis approaches, to advance RCM for noninvasive detection of melanoma. Furthermore, these approaches can be useful for non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous lymphoma and other skin disorders (wider impact). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an optical imaging technology that can guide biopsy and enable noninvasive screening and diagnosis of skin cancers. However, visual reading and interpretation of RCM images requires substantial training for clinicians. We propose to develop computer-based algorithms to assist clinicians in reading images, serve as tools for training, and accelerate wider adoption of RCM technology by dermatologists.",Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy,9536759,R01CA199673,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cutaneous Lymphoma', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Glass', 'Hypersensitivity skin testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Italy', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mosaicism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pigments', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'melanoma', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optical imaging', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,619539,-0.020728860508636208
"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies,9525950,R01EB021900,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discipline', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peru', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'Underrepresented Students', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccines', 'Wait Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'compliance behavior', 'data exchange', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'disadvantaged population', 'disease transmission', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'image processing', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'social', 'social inequality', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2018,333515,0.017751121565615962

"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice.

"MICCAI 2018 - 21th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Project Summary The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation, facilitation of research and education in the fields of medical image computing (MIC) and computer assisted interventions (CAI) including biomedical imaging and robotics; this is achieved through the organization and operation of regular international conferences of highest quality and publications which promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience in the field produced by leading institutions and outstanding scientists, physicians, and educators around the world. MICCAI Conferences have their roots and origin in three separate but related conferences beginning in early 1990s, the Visualization in Biomedical Computing (VBC), Computer Vision and Virtual Reality in Robotics and Medicine (CVRMed), and Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery (MRCAS), which merged into a single annual conference in 1998. MICCAI Conferences have defined a new scientific discipline over the years and have become the premier conference in the field with their proceedings having an impact factor comparable to high-impact computational journals. Conference topics include, computer vision & image processing for medical imaging, computer-aided diagnosis, computer-assisted intervention & surgery, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality, bioscience and biology applications, specific imaging systems and new biomedical imaging applications, spanning disciplines such as radiology, pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry. The main MICCAI conference includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. The quality and importance of poster presentations are considered to be on a par with those of oral presentations, with both undergoing a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance) and several presented papers becoming landmark publications over the years reaching up to 2,000 citations. The conference series includes community-driven software challenges, workshops and tutorials just before and/or after the main conference. These satellite events focus in detail on the current status and advances in topics relevant to MICCAI and are very highly attended. The MICCAI Conferences span the entire globe and are usually rotated among the American, European, and Asian continents. Attendance typically includes more than 45 countries, with strong student representation (~40%). The MICCAI 2018 Conference will be held in Granada, Spain in September 16th-20th, 2018. An innovative aspect of MICCAI 2018 is the initiation of a “Mentoring Program” to connect students and young investigators with established mentors from academia and industry. Along with the mission of “Women in MICCAI” committee, this proposal requests funds to initiate and ultimately sustain student travel awards to specifically enhance diversity in conference attendance, including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, to present their work, providing them with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations. Project Narrative The MICCAI 2018 Conference will be held in Granada, Spain during September 16th-20th, 2018. The MICCAI conferences are the premier meeting in the medical image computing (MIC) and computer assisted intervention (CAI) communities, having introduced several landmark papers and providing a springboard for young scientists to establish themselves in the field.

"Neighborhood Looking Glass: 360 Degree Automated Characterization of the Built Environment for Neighborhood Effects Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal represents a vertical advancement in neighborhood effects research, producing for the first time, national neighborhood indicators of the built environment. Thus far, only local studies have been conducted due to the resource-intensive nature of site visits to conduct assessments of community features and also manual annotations of street images. With the recent advancement of computer vision and the emergence of massive sources of image data, we will leverage our team’s abilities to develop a data collection strategy utilizing geographic information systems to assemble a national collection of Google Street View images of all road intersections and street segments in the United States. We will utilize this data bank, and develop informatics algorithms to produce neighborhood summaries of built environment that have been theoretically and empirically identified to be important for health outcomes. After the creation of Neighborhood Looking Glass, we will conduct investigations into the impact of neighborhood environments on health utilizing medical records from hundreds of thousands of patients and accounting for predisposing characteristics in analyses. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, computer vision, bioinformatics, and computer science—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Develop informatics techniques to produce neighborhood quality indicators; 2) Measure the accuracy of data algorithms and construct an interactive geoportal for neighborhood data visualization and data sharing, 3) Utilize Neighborhood Looking Glass and a large collection of medical records from Intermountain Healthcare to investigate neighborhood influences on the risk of obesity and substance abuse. The epidemic rise in chronic health conditions is recent and as such suggests its cause is social, cultural, and constructed rather than purely biological. Thus, we have the possibility of intervening on the environment to better support health. Recent studies suggest that the current cohort of young adults may face historically high cardiovascular disease risk and chronic disease burden. Our substantive investigation of the impact of neighborhood factors on chronic conditions will contribute further to the understanding of contextual influences on the health of this cohort at the forefront of a chronic disease epidemic. Moreover, the dramatic rise in overdoses, accidental poisonings, and mental health issues contributing to premature mortality warrants further investigation into risk-inducing environmental factors for substance abuse. Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics. Results can be utilized to inform population-based strategies to reduce health disparities and improve health. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The epidemic rise in obesity, related chronic diseases, and substance abuse in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. The development of the Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics with potential impact on health. Results from our project can be utilized to inform system-wide and local strategies to improve community health.",Neighborhood Looking Glass: 360 Degree Automated Characterization of the Built Environment for Neighborhood Effects Research,9499844,R01LM012849,"['Accounting', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Glass', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site Visit', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'density', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'land use', 'obesity risk', 'object recognition', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'social', 'social media', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NLM,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,355252,-0.036858948811176837
"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,9542210,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Pathologic', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'wasting', 'whole slide imaging']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,377571,0.047485343480496066
"Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 Digital Whole Slide Scanner Project Summary/Abstract This application is for a shared instrumentation grant from the Light Microscope Imaging Facility at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) School of Medicine (SOM) to acquire a fully automated, high-capacity, high- resolution Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 slide scanner that can accommodate both brightfield and fluorescence imaging in single-slide and double-slide formats. We also request MicroDimensions 3D reconstruction and alignment software packages for manipulating and analyzing the whole slide images produced with the scanner. We need to replace a scanner that is not functioning properly. Our well-established shared core facility supports NIH-funded investigators by giving them access to state-of-the-art microscopy technologies that enhance collaborative, multidisciplinary research. Acquisition of this instrument will have a high impact on the biomedical research at CWRU and expand the scope of our NIH-funded projects. Several projects have been identified that will utilize the scanner and its associated analyses programs. These include: the genetic mechanisms underlying skin fibrosis and cranial bone development (Atit); the mechanisms behind the lifelong functions of transcription factors in axonal growth and architecture (Deneris); deep-learning for histologic image predictors of various diseases (Madabhushi); the development of diagnostic probes to discriminate between glioma subtypes for screening and survival therapies (Brady-Kalnay); the role of progesterone receptors in the control of parturition and the development of therapies to prevent preterm birth (Messiano); the mechanisms by which breast cancer stem cells overcome metastatic latency leading to disease recurrence and the biomarkers that could potentially identify those tumors likely to undergo this process (Schiemann); and the significance of cholesterol-related proteins in brain and retinal function (Pikuleva). Many additional projects of minor users and others at CWRU are anticipated. All of the proposed projects are in need of a high-capacity automated scanner acquiring whole slide images so that analyses can be applied to tissues that cover hundreds of fields of view, rather than the single regions of interest that can be acquired on a standard microscope. Narrative This proposal seeks to acquire a new, state-of-the-art high-speed, high content digital slide scanner for high resolution cellular and biomarker identfcation across large tissue areas. The dual mode (fluorescence and brightfield) allows flexibility in marker visualization while the software allows the automated alignment of whole slide images for multi-stain analysis and 3d reconstruction of serial section for in-depth analysis of specimens.

"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9438535,R01EY025332,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,416574,0.005271966283630947
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,9679722,R41MH118845,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2018,303226,-0.004463424219735837
"Insightful Surgical Vision Technology (ISVision) for intelligent real-time display of anatomic, physiologic, and pathologic information in surgery Abstract Intelligent intraoperative display of anatomic and physiologic information coupled to real time situational awareness to critical tissues will benefit all surgery. The current surgical vision is limited to naked human eyes in open surgery or more recently using laparoscopic digital imaging for minimally invasive surgery and robot assisted surgery. In laparoscopic vision, although the visualization of surface anatomy and tissue physiology in the surgical field-of-view has been enhanced by recent advances in optical imaging technology, the imaging paradigm still remains passive and still poses a significant challenge due to the inherent narrow peripheral vision and limited depth perception. We propose the next generation laparoscopic vision system that provides intelligent display of unrecognized tissue structures to human eyes. Our proposed use of a new paradigm and surgical vision technology (called ISVisionTM), equipped with modular plenoptic 3-D Color/HD camera and snapshot NIR hyperspectral imager, will permit a clear visualization of the critical target tissue-of-interest, surrounding anatomy into the operative field, and situational awareness for both the tool and tissue to the surgeon. Our Phase I effort comprises of engineering the clinically viable ISVision platform and testing the performance of its intraoperative use. Specifically, the ISVision system will clearly and precisely identify different tissue characteristics, accurately displaying physiologic information including tissue perfusion and blood flow. Following the Phase 1, we anticipate undertaking a Phase II project, during which we will develop a clinical grade ISVision system and investigate its performance and utility in the operating room. While the initial focus of the Phase I and II effort is on the complex surgery such as liver resection due to crucial nature of critical sub-surface structures located underneath liver hilum and parenchyma, the ISVision system will potentially play an enabling role in all surgeries and establish it as a vital component of the operating room of the future. Narrative Real-time display of the accurate anatomic and tissue physiology during surgery is necessary and crucial in improving surgical outcomes. This proposal aims to develop the next generation surgical vision system that provides intelligent display of unrecognized, unseen tissue structures to human eyes. The current state of the art technology still remains passive, focuses on anatomic display only. A new surgical vision technology, called ISVisionTM, will provide clear display of important anatomic structures, identify not only their distinct shape and position, and offer insightful intelligent function during surgical procedures. The academic partner in this proposal has developed a novel research prototype and has shown that the new imaging tool can enhance surgical vision beyond human visibility for preclinical testing. The small business partner backed by a Venture company from the Bay area has a strong background for successful commercialization. Together, we aim to convert the academic research prototype into a clinically viable market product that will significantly improve the safety, function, and outcome of surgery, not limited by surgeons’ visual perception, training or experience. The ISVision technology will make the surgery safer and more effective.","Insightful Surgical Vision Technology (ISVision) for intelligent real-time display of anatomic, physiologic, and pathologic information in surgery",9781563,R41EB026402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Blood flow', 'Businesses', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Conventional Surgery', 'Coupled', 'Depth Perception', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hepatic artery', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intestines', 'Investments', 'Laparoscopes', 'Laparoscopy', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Research', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Perception', 'Work', 'base', 'bile duct', 'clinical translation', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'graphical user interface', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'meetings', 'millisecond', 'minimally invasive', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'performance tests', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'robot assistance', 'sensor', 'soft tissue', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NIBIB,"ACTIV SURGICAL, INC",R41,2018,42000,0.0017141068374088477

Our Phase I effort comprises of engineering the clinically viable ISVision platform and testing the performance of its intraoperative use. Specifically, the ISVision system will clearly and precisely identify different tissue characteristics, accurately displaying physiologic information including tissue perfusion and blood flow. Following the Phase 1, we anticipate undertaking a Phase II project, during which we will develop a clinical grade ISVision system and investigate its performance and utility in the operating room. While the initial focus of the Phase I and II effort is on the complex surgery such as liver resection due to crucial nature of critical sub-surface structures located underneath liver hilum and parenchyma, the ISVision system will potentially play an enabling role in all surgeries and establish it as a vital component of the operating room of the future. Narrative Real-time display of the accurate anatomic and tissue physiology during surgery is necessary and crucial in improving surgical outcomes. This proposal aims to develop the next generation surgical vision system that provides intelligent display of unrecognized, unseen tissue structures to human eyes. The current state of the art technology still remains passive, focuses on anatomic display only. A new surgical vision technology, called ISVisionTM, will provide clear display of important anatomic structures, identify not only their distinct shape and position, and offer insightful intelligent function during surgical procedures. The academic partner in this proposal has developed a novel research prototype and has shown that the new imaging tool can enhance surgical vision beyond human visibility for preclinical testing. The small business partner backed by a Venture company from the Bay area has a strong background for successful commercialization. Together, we aim to convert the academic research prototype into a clinically viable market product that will significantly improve the safety, function, and outcome of surgery, not limited by surgeons’ visual perception, training or experience. The ISVision technology will make the surgery safer and more effective.","Insightful Surgical Vision Technology (ISVision) for intelligent real-time display of anatomic, physiologic, and pathologic information in surgery",9622159,R41EB026402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Blood flow', 'Businesses', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Conventional Surgery', 'Coupled', 'Depth Perception', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hepatic artery', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intestines', 'Investments', 'Laparoscopes', 'Laparoscopy', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Research', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Perception', 'Work', 'base', 'bile duct', 'clinical translation', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'graphical user interface', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'meetings', 'millisecond', 'minimally invasive', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'performance tests', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'robot assistance', 'sensor', 'soft tissue', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NIBIB,"ACTIV SURGICAL, INC",R41,2018,200769,0.0017141068374088477
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9449456,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'clinical imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2018,64155,-0.005286436766996672
"Fully-automated lesion characterization in ultrawide-field retinal images Abstract  In this grant application we propose to develop, EyeReadUWF, a fully automated tool for lesion characterization in ultra-widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images. In recent times non mydriatic UWF SLO imaging has been shown to be a promising alternative to conventional digital color fundus imaging for grading of diabetic eye diseases, with advantages including 130°-200° field-of-view showing more than 80% of the retina in a single image, no need for multiple fields, multiple flashes, or refocusing between field acquisitions, ability to penetrate media opacities like cataract, and lower rate of ungradable images. UWF SLO images are particularly suitable for detecting predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. Accurate quantification of presence and extent of PPLs can only be done by a robust automated tool that is specifically designed for the pseudo-colored images of UWF SLO modality. EyeReadUWF will automatically characterize lesions in pseudo colored UWF images while handling possible artifacts from eyelashes and determine the lesion predominance in peripheral and central regions of UWF image. The ability to accurately quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions in UWF SLO images can enable clinicians to triage patients with higher risk of DR progression and onset of PDR, have a positive impact on diabetic patient management, and aid drug discovery research. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeReadUWF, will perform automated lesion characterization in ultra- widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images to quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. To the best of our knowledge, no commercial automated analysis tool is currently indicated for UWF SLO images. Once clinically validated, the tool can enable clinicians to triage patients with higher risk of DR progression and onset of PDR, have a positive impact on diabetic patient management, and aid drug discovery research.",Fully-automated lesion characterization in ultrawide-field retinal images,9559582,R43EY028081,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Blindness', 'Cataract', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Color', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyelash', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Lasers', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Microaneurysm', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Normalcy', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fovea centralis', 'fundus imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'operation', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'screening program', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2018,216440,-0.004047593560446642
"RetiVue DR, a point and shoot, non-mydriatic, widefield retinal camera for diabetic eye screening Project Summary Over the past two decades, diabetic retinopathy (DR) has become the leading cause of adult blindness in the US, affecting 40% of all diabetic patients and resulting in $500 million a year in direct medical costs. Vision loss due to DR is largely preventable and can be reduced by up to 90% with appropriate eye screening. However, in the US, less than 50% of diabetic patients receive a recommended yearly eye exam due to many factors that include lack of access to eye care professionals. Distributed tele-ophthalmic screening thru primary care clinics can potentially provide all diabetic patients cost- effective, yearly evaluations to detect DR and prevent vision loss. However, gold-standard sensitive detection of DR using standard retinal photography is complex and cumbersome process requiring up to 7 images per eye. This screening process cannot for all practical purposes be achieved without having highly trained ophthalmic photographers. RetiVue proposes to develop the RetiVue DR in collaboration with Olympus, to create the first handheld, non- mydriatic, 160 field of view, widefield DR screening camera. It will allow single photo capture of an area up to ten times greater than conventional fundus cameras, allowing sensitive detection of DR at its earliest time points. Full integration of RetiVue and Olympus hardware will enable the most advanced and highest image quality handheld retina camera on the market. Use of automated alignment, auto laser focus, and auto image capture will allow complex imaging of the retina to be performed simply by positioning the iris, requiring no user knowledge of retinal anatomy. We have established clinical proof of concept with our patented technology, but require several additional innovations in optical design, automated image recognition, and retinal image processing to enable a commercial device. We will for this proposal optimize our alignment system and laser based focusing system for widefield imaging, allowing automated alignment and focus to image the retina before eye movement occurs. We will develop a new method of widefield, non-mydriatic peripheral retinal imaging using multiple LED slit-beam projectors to allow rapid, segmental, sequential image capture of 90°, 120°, and 160° FOV on diabetic patients. Finally, we will create the most advanced retinal image processing algorithms to remove Purkinje haze which prevents conventional cameras from imaging beyond 45° FOV and enable seamless stitching of segmental peripheral retina images into a single widefield image. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is a blinding eye disease that affects millions of people with diabetes and costs the US $500 million a year in medical costs. Loss of vision can be prevented if diabetic patients undergo yearly eye screening that examines the retina to detect this disease, but currently less than 50% of diabetics do so. At Re- tiVue LLC, we are designing the first easy to use handheld eye camera to allow primary care doctors to take DSLR quality pictures of the eye to look for diabetic retinopathy. Our eye camera will see 5 times more of the retina than any other handheld camera, ensuring that we find diabetic retinopathy when it first occurs. Earlier detection of diabetic retinopathy will give diabetic patients the best chance to keep their vision long term, and avoid unnecessary blindness.","RetiVue DR, a point and shoot, non-mydriatic, widefield retinal camera for diabetic eye screening",9564677,R44EY028484,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Iris', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Masks', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Photography', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNFRSF10B gene', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Validation', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'image processing', 'imager', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'lens', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'retinal imaging', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'seal', 'sensor', 'success']",NEI,RETIVUE,R44,2018,847697,-0.01792616481881746
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9547416,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,597688,0.030890820008482745
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9548627,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2018,573677,0.02254113798227515
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,9215686,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'student training', 'teaching assistant', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2017,59383,0.0003441810706845517
"Artificial neural networks for high performance, fully automated particle tracking analysis even at low signal-to-noise regimes Abstract: Particle tracking (PT) is a powerful biophysical tool for elucidating molecular interactions, transport phenomena and rheological properties in complex biological environments. Unfortunately, PT remains a niche tool in life and physical sciences with a limited user base, in large part due to significant time and technical constraints in extracting accurate time-variant positional data from recorded movies. These constraints are exacerbated in experiments with low signal-to-noise ratios or substantial heterogeneity, as frequently encountered with nanoparticles and pathogens in biological fluids. Currently available software that attempts to automate the movie analysis process rely almost exclusively on assigning static image filters based on specific intensity, pixel size and signal-to-noise ratio thresholds. Unfortunately, when applied to actual experimental data with substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity, the current software generally produces substantial numbers of false positives (i.e. tracking artifacts) or false negatives (i.e. missing actual traces), and frequently both. Frequent user intervention is thus required to ensure accurate tracking even when using sophisticated tracking software, markedly reducing experimental throughput and resulting in substantial user- to-user variations in analyzed data. The time required for accurate particle tracking analysis makes PT experiments exceedingly expensive compared to other commonly used experimental techniques in life sciences. These same tracking analysis limitations have effectively precluded investigators from undertaking more sophisticated 3D PT, even though the microscopy capability to obtain such movies is readily available and critical scientific insights can be gained from 3D PT. To circumvent the challenges with currently available particle tracking software, we have developed a new approach for particle identification and tracking, based on machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNN is a type of feed-forward artificial neural network designed to process information in a layered network of connections that mimics the organization of real neural networks in the mammalian retina and visual cortex. Unlike most CNN imaging models that are trained to make predictions on static images, we have trained our CNN to input adjacent frames so that each prediction includes information from the past and future, thus effectively performing convolutions in both space and time to infer particle locations. Similar principles of image analysis are now being harnessed by developers of autonomous vehicle technologies to distinguish the motions of different objects on the road. We have applied our CNN tracking algorithm to a wide range of 2D movies capturing dynamic motions of nanoparticles, viruses and highly motile bacteria, achieving at least 30-fold time savings with virtually no need for human intervention while maintaining robust tracking performance (i.e. low false positive and low false negative rates). In this STTR proposal, we seek to focus on further optimization and testing of our neural network tracking platform for 2D PT, including the use of cloud computing (Aim 1), and extending our neural network tracker to enable accurate 3D PT (Aim 2). Our vision is to popularize PT as a research tool among researchers by minimizing the time and labor costs associated with PT analysis. Narrative Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool in life and physical sciences, but unfortunately its application has been strongly limited by inefficiencies in accurately extracting particle traces from raw movies. Unlike conventional particle tracking methods, we have combined artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a computational neural network that can recognize objects in much the same way as the human eye, and which consistently provided superior and truly automated tracking performance compared to current alternatives. This STTR will establish the feasibility of using our computational neural network for robust 2D and 3D particle tracking analysis.","Artificial neural networks for high performance, fully automated particle tracking analysis even at low signal-to-noise regimes",9347679,R41GM123897,"['Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Spottings', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical tools', 'cell motility', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'field study', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'movie', 'nanoparticle', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'physical science', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'submicron', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"AI TRACKING SOLUTIONS, LLC",R41,2017,224997,-0.01202101122571168
"Naturalistic Data Collection In The SmartPlayroom PROJECT SUMMARY The aims of this proposal are to fully develop and validate the SmartPlayroom as a powerful automated data collection and analysis tool in developmental research. This room looks like any playroom in a home or school but is designed to naturalistically collect data in real time and simultaneously on all aspects of children's behavior. Behaviors include movement kinematics, language, eye movements, and social interaction while a child performs naturalistic tasks, plays and explores without instruction, walks or crawls, and interacts with a caregiver. The space is equipped with mobile eye tracking, wireless physiological heart rate and galvanic skin response sensors, audio and video recording, and depth sensor technologies. Funding is requested to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement using an example from visual attention research (Aim 1), and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use in 4-9 year-old children (Aim 2). By combining fine-grained sensor data with high-throughput automated computer vision and machine learning tools, we will be able to automate quantitative data collection and analysis in the SmartPlayroom for use in addressing myriad developmental questions. The SmartPlayroom approach overcomes completely the limitations of task-based experimentation in developmental research, offering quantitative precision in the collection of ecologically valid data. It has the power to magnify both construct validity and measurement reliability in developmental research. The investigators are committed to making freely available our data, computer vision algorithms, and discoveries so that we might move the field forward quickly. NARRATIVE We focus this work on developing and validating a novel and innovative data collection space called the SmartPlayroom, designed to pair naturalistic exploration and action with the precision of computerized automated data collection and analysis.

"A high-throughput imaging and classification system for fruit flies PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In this Phase I SBIR application, FlySorter proposes to development a high throughput imaging and classification system to aid research with fruit flies, a widely-used model organism relevant to both basic science as well as studies in human health. The use of animal model systems is essential for research in almost all aspects of biology: genetics, development, neuroscience, disease, physiology, and beyond. The fruit fly – Drosophila melanogaster – is small and easy to care for, but is complex enough an organism to provide a wealth of information that directly relates to human biology and health. Over 75% of human diseases with a genetic basis (including depression, alcoholism, certain forms of cancer, and many more) are either present or have an analog in Drosophila. Modern genetic tools, such as CRISPR/cas9, allow the creation of transgenic flies that provide the opportunity to study diseases, pathways and systems that don’t exist naturally in Drosophila. With these advances, fruit flies are becoming more frequently subjects for drugs screens. For all the advances in the biological tools and techniques applicable to flies, however, the limiting factor in many experiments is the manual labor involved in a few common tasks: moving flies from vial to vial or other lab equipment; classifying and sorting flies by sex, eye color and other phenotypes; and collecting virgin female flies before they mate so that they can be used in controlled crosses, etc. FlySorter’s patent-pending fly dispensing mechanism can reliably deliver a single organism from a vial containing hundreds of awake flies, and our novel FlyPlate system allows storage of individual flies in custom 96 well plates. FlySorter’s robotic fly handling system, co-developed with the de Bivort Lab at Harvard, is capable of manipulating and transporting those individual flies between vial, 96 well plate, and experimental apparatus. The next piece of the automation puzzle to solve is high throughput imaging and classification. To accomplish this goal, FlySorter will: 1) complete a prototype automated image capture hardware system; 2) adapt state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms for use on Drosophila; and 3) build a module that can physically sort the classified flies into different vials. Once integrated into the existing FlySorter product ecosystem, this imaging and classification module will greatly expand the kinds of experiments and screens that can be automated, allowing for the study of larger populations or a wider variety of flies, reducing the impact of human error, and freeing up valuable time for researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fruit flies – Drosophila melanogaster – are one of the most widely used model organisms in biology, for research in genetics, development, neuroscience, disease, and much more. One of the most common tasks in Drosophila labs is sorting flies by various markers and phenotypes using a microscope and paintbrush. FlySorter aims to build an automated system for sorting flies using high resolution digital cameras and modern computer vision algorithms, which will obviate the need for such tedious manual labor.",A high-throughput imaging and classification system for fruit flies,9408980,R43OD023302,"['Air', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Automation', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Eye Color', 'Female', 'Floor', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Legal patent', 'Lighting', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microscope', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Obesity', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Partner in relationship', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Sclera', 'Shapes', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Universities', 'Vial device', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analog', 'awake', 'base', 'depression model', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic strain', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory equipment', 'male', 'meter', 'novel', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sex', 'tool', 'virtual']",OD,"FLYSORTER, LLC",R43,2017,225000,0.014293850936414321
"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project. After successfully fulfilling all of its aims, our framework for optimal multi-surface andor multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation was further extended, validated, and its practical utility demonstrated in clinical and translational image analysis tasks. This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. We propose to: 1) Develop 3D, 4D, and generally n-D approaches for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions (objects) and surfaces. 2) Develop methods for data-driven automated design of cost functions used for surface-based, region-based, and surface-and-region-based graph search image segmentation. 3) Develop ""Just-Enough-Interaction"" (JEI) approaches for efficient ""real-time"" medical image segmentation, thus achieving robust clinical applicability of quantitative medical image analysis. 4) Assess performance of all developed methods in translational research settings; determine performance in quantitative medical image analysis and radiation oncology treatment planning workflow. As a result, our project will enable routine quantification and therefore personalized care.

"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9385425,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2017,220062,-0.0248487262585728
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris�n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris�n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,9264531,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2017,339750,0.02287966113538247
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9282634,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collimator', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical imaging', 'computer generated', 'cost', 'detector', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'solid state', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,600120,0.0006507800079313289
"Capti Screen Reading Assistant for Goal Directed Web Browsing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Web browsing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and magnifiers can often be a frustrating and challenging experience for people with vision impairments, because it entails a lot of searching for content, forms, and links that are required for doing online tasks such as shopping, bill-payment, reservations, etc. This SBIR Phase II project will build on Phase I results and will continue the development and eventual deployment of Capti Screen Reading Assistant - a next-generation assistive technology, enabling goal- directed web browsing for people with visual impairments. With Capti Assistant, users will be able to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals that are expressed in natural language (spoken or typed). The Assistant will lead the users step-by-step towards the fulfillment of these goals by offering suggestions on what action to take at every step of the way and automatically executing the chosen action on behalf of the user. Suggested actions will include operations such as form filling, activating controls (e.g., clicking buttons and links), et. Capti Assistant will dramatically reduce the time spent by people with visual impairments on performing tasks online. The Assistant will significantly improve the speed and efficiency with which they can interact with the Web, thereby, making people with disabilities more productive in today's web-based economy. Given a user browsing goal, expressed in a natural-language form, Capti Assistant will utilize a predictive model to guide the user toward the goal. The unique aspect of the Assistant is that its suggestions will be automatically learned from the user's own history of browsing actions and commands, as well as from the user's demonstration of how to accomplish browsing tasks that have not been done before. The Assistant will process user commands and present the suggested browsing actions to the user on demand, giving the user a choice between following the suggestions or continue browsing normally without accepting the suggestions. The functionality offered by the Assistant will go far beyond popular personal assistant applications such as Siri, which have not been designed specifically for people with vision impairments, and which cannot be used for ad hocweb browsing. Capti Assistant will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the Web. For them, the Assistant will usher in a new era of independence and employability in our global web-based economy. Thus, from a broader perspective, goal- directed browsing will exemplify the vision of the Universally Accessible Web whose thesis is ""equal access for all"", i.e. anyone should be able to reap the benefits of the Web without being constrained by any disability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR Project seeks to do Research and Development on goal-directed web browsing - the next generation accessible technology that will empower people with vision impairments to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals, while the browser will do low-level operations (such as clicking on links and filling forms) necessary to fulfill these goals. Goal-directed browsing will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the web, thus improving independence and employability of the former in our global Web-based economy.

"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care.

In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9544350,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2017,56360,0.01596931152997633

"Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is diagnosed in approximately 124,000 people and is responsible for about 10,000 deaths every year, in the USA. Dermatologists rely on visual and dermatoscopic examination to discriminate benign melanocytic lesions from malignant, resulting in high and highly variable benign-to-malignant biopsy ratios from 8:1 to 47:1, and millions of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging has been proven for noninvasively guiding diagnosis of melanoma in several large clinical studies. RCM imaging at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) provides sensitivity of 92-88% and specificity of 71-84%. The specificity is 2 times superior to that of dermatoscopy. RCM imaging at the DEJ is now being implemented to rule out malignancy, reduce biopsy and guide treatment. However, this is currently at only a few sites, where there are highly trained experts who can ensure that imaging is appropriately performed and images are read correctly. These experts are a small international cohort of ""early adopter"" clinicians, who have worked with RCM technology during the past decade and have become highly skilled readers. For novice (non-expert) clinicians in the wider cohort who are keen to adopt RCM, learning to read images is challenging and requires substantial effort and time. Two major technical barriers underlie the dramatic variability in diagnostic accuracy among novice clinicians. Together they limit utility, reproducibility and wider adoption of RCM. The first is user dependent subjective variability in depths near the DEJ at which images are acquired, and the second is variability in interpretation of images. We propose to address these barriers with computational ""multi-faceted"" classification modeling (innovation), image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop and evaluate algorithms for both dermatoscopic images and RCM depth-stacks, to enable automated standardized and consistent acquisition of RCM mosaics at the DEJ in melanocytic lesions; (2) to develop and evaluate algorithms to discriminate patterns of cellular morphology at the DEJ into two classes, benign lesions versus malignant (dysplastic lesions and melanoma); and (3) to test our algorithms on patients for acquisition of RCM mosaics and classification into those two groups, with statistical validation against pathology, with statistical validation against pathology. Preliminary studies show that our algorithms can delineate the DEJ with accuracy in the range ~3-13 μm in strongly pigmented dark skin and ~5-20 μm in lightly pigmented fair skin, and can detect cellular morphologic patterns with sensitivity in the range 67-80% and specificity 78-99%. Melanocytic lesions can be distinguished from the surrounding normal skin at the DEJ with 80% classification accuracy. We are a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and University of Modena. Our success will produce standardized imaging and analysis approaches, to advance RCM for noninvasive detection of melanoma. Furthermore, these approaches can be useful for non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous lymphoma and other skin disorders (wider impact). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an optical imaging technology that can guide biopsy and enable noninvasive screening and diagnosis of skin cancers. However, visual reading and interpretation of RCM images requires substantial training for clinicians. We propose to develop computer-based algorithms to assist clinicians in reading images, serve as tools for training, and accelerate wider adoption of RCM technology by dermatologists.",Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy,9315773,R01CA199673,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cutaneous Lymphoma', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Glass', 'Hypersensitivity skin testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Italy', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mosaicism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pigments', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'melanoma', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optical imaging', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2017,619539,-0.020728860508636208
"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies,9150601,R01EB021900,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discipline', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peru', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'Underrepresented Students', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccines', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'compliance behavior', 'data exchange', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'disadvantaged population', 'disease transmission', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'image processing', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'social', 'social inequality', 'telehealth', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2017,326571,0.017751121565615962
"Development of An Integrated High Throughput Imaging and Image Analysis Platform for Muscle ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is growing awareness that weakness of muscle is a significant biomedical health issue associated with many different chronic diseases and aging. There are a variety of different diseases that affect muscle, including muscular dystrophy, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis, each of which carries its own unique set of symptoms, accompanied by a myriad of genetic and molecular abnormalities. There is agreement within the basic research and clinical communities that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber cross sectional area, fiber type, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis are among many critical factors that determine the health and functionality of the muscle. Until now, the imaging equipment available is relatively low throughput and the quantification is still largely based on manual or, at best, semi-automatic methods that require extensive human intervention. In Phase I, CytoInformatics LLC has developed a software called CytoQuant, which can accurately perform automatic segmentation and provide accurate boundaries of each muscle fiber for a cropped image patch. The goal of CytoInformatics LLC in Phase II is to 1) deliver the first version of the CytoQuant software to the market, 2) develop the second version of CytoQuant by continuously improving its performance, especially in handling large scale, whole slide images, and also 3) develop an integrated multiplexing imaging hardware and analysis software framework as a seamless solution for high throughput, automated image analysis of muscle specimens. After careful investigation in Phase I (please refer to the details in business plan), we conclude that this integrated software/hardware platform with cutting-edge technologies in advanced imaging, large scale machine learning, and big data is commercially attractive to the entire muscle community including research institutes, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and athletic companies, demonstrated by strong enthusiasm among end users and many supporting letters. The specific aims are: 1) Deliver the first version of CytoQuant developed in Phase I to the market, continue to develop the second version of CytoQuant, which will focus on improving the robustness and speed in handling whole slide images; 2) Develop an integrated platform that provides unified imaging hardware and image analysis software to handle whole slide images labeled with multiple bio-relevant markers. This unified whole-slide based software and hardware solution will deliver an efficient and specialized imaging platform that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, multi-marker, and automatic image analysis software specifically designed for muscle. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In Phase II, CytoInformatics is proposing a unified whole-slide multispectral imaging (MSI) system that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, accurate, and automated software to provide fast and efficient, multiplexed imaging and quantitative muscle image analysis simultaneously. This will be the first integrated hardware/software solution that is specifically designed for muscle.",Development of An Integrated High Throughput Imaging and Image Analysis Platform for Muscle,9355100,R42AG055375,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Athletic', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Infiltration', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Eosine Yellowish', 'Equipment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Qi', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Software Design', 'Software Framework', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Yang', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'commercialization', 'design', 'experience', 'gigabyte', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'muscle form', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'technology development', 'user-friendly']",NIA,"CYTOINFORMATICS, LLC",R42,2017,391844,0.049537832977610476
"Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents PI: Ronny Shalev, PhD, Dyad Medical Summary Dyad Medical, Inc. will create intravascular OCT (IVOCT) software for clinical, live time determination of stent apposition (OCTivat-live, the live time OCT image visualization and analysis tool) and for offline analysis of stent implantation (OCTivat-stent). Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intra- vascular stents creating an opportunity for both solutions. Although advancements such as drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent design parameters include drug, material (bioresorbable vs metal), polymer composition, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To opti- mize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical evaluations. Intravascular OCT (IVOCT) is the lone imaging modality with the resolution and contrast to meet this challenge. The Core Lab at CWRU is the premiere site in the world for manual analysis of IVOCT image data. A cardiologist analyst takes 6-16 hrs to analyze manually a single stent, and despite training and quality assurance measures, inter- analyst variability can limit the power to determine changes between stent designs. Building upon work at CWRU, we will develop advanced, highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibil- ity, increase accuracy, and harmonize analysis. Software will reduce costs by decreasing manual labor, and with improved reproducibility, possibly enable the use of historical data, eliminating cost of a control arm. Re- garding live time analysis, rather than manually reviewing >500 images in a pullback, with fast software, it will be possible to present the number and location of malapposed struts in 3D, providing instant feedback to phy- sicians on the need for additional dilatation with a larger balloon or higher pressure. In addition, we will auto- matically determine stent and vessel area along the length of the pullback, allowing us to compute stent ex- pansion and eccentricity, quantitative measures related to successful stent deployment, the most important de- terminant of outcome. IVOCT could also play a role at patient follow up. If a stent is well covered, then long- term anti-platelet therapy might be unnecessary, minimizing bleeding risk. If a stent has many uncovered struts, a therapeutic might prevent stent thrombosis or stimulate healing. Project Narrative: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year. Our methods will enable optimization of stent technologies and improved deployment for improved treatment of vascular dis- ease.",Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents,9407267,R43HL137500,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dilatation - action', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Feedback', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stents', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'arm', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'healing', 'image visualization', 'imaging modality', 'implantation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'personalized diagnostics', 'preclinical evaluation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research clinical testing', 'restenosis', 'statistics', 'stent thrombosis', 'tool', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,"DYAD MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2017,224744,0.021174915485250047
"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,9316507,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Pathologic', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,379732,0.047485343480496066
"Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An online community called EyeWire proved that volunteers can be motivated to reconstruct neural circuits through an activity resembling a 3D coloring book. EyeWire helped discover space-time speciﬁcity of the wiring from bipolar cells to starburst amacrine cells, which suggested a surprising new model for direction selectivity in the retina. Motivated by this success, we are preparing to launch EyeWire II, which aims to map the entire retinal connectome, yielding the ﬁrst complete wiring diagram for any region of the mammalian CNS. This ambitious goal will require innovative advances in virtually every component of EyeWire. The underlying electron microscopic image of the retina will be replaced by a new image with increased size and quality. A new artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) will be trained using a new software package for 3D deep learning. While the improved AI is expected to reduce the amount of human effort required to reconstruct a neuron, the number of neurons targeted for reconstruction will also increase dramatically. Overall, the absolute amount of human effort required will increase rather than decrease. Therefore it is critical to improve EyeWire's crowdsourcing to (1) mobilize more human effort and (2) to use human effort more efﬁciently. This project aims to radically improve both aspects, thereby making the retinal connectome achievable by EyeWire II. In Aim 1, we will create a compelling mobile game with the target of engaging 10x more people than the existing EyeWire community. In Aim 2, we will develop and deploy new crowdsourcing algorithms that extract wisdom from the crowd by weighted voting and optimally assign players to tasks. The Aims will be achieved through collaboration between three organizations. Wired Differently, Inc. (WD) is a new Boston-based nonproﬁt organization dedicated to ""citizen neuroscience"" that was recently spun out of MIT. WD currently operates EyeWire in collaboration with the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. The Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at Carnegie Mellon University will offer a project-based class to its master's students to design and prototype new ideas for the mobile game. Both Aims will produce code and algorithms that will be made publicly available, and could have broad impact on citizen science. As the ﬁrst crowdsourcing of 3D image analysis, the code produced by Aim 1 could be useful for the many other kinds of 3D images found in biomedical research. The crowdsourcing algorithms of Aim 2 are potentially useful for any citizen science project facing the challenge of obtaining accurate and reliable results from a heterogeneous group of volunteers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeWire II will increase public understanding of the structure of the nervous system. The retinal connectome could aid those attempting to develop blindness therapies based on regenerating cells and their wiring. It could also aid the development of retinal prosthetics that directly stimulate ganglion cells and computationally emulate the bypassed micro circuitry. 1",Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II,9330810,UH2CA203710,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Books', 'Boston', 'Breathing', 'Bypass', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Love', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Territoriality', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Volunteer Group', 'Voting', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'fine art', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'online community', 'pleasure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'retinal prosthesis', 'simulation', 'starburst amacrine cell', 'success', 'university student', 'virtual', 'visual neuroscience', 'volunteer']",NCI,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,320900,0.007193137086406221
"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9238777,R01EY025332,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,416574,0.005271966283630947
"Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1.4 million women per year depend on pathologists to accurately interpret breast biopsies for a diagnosis of benign disease or cancer. Diagnostic errors are alarmingly frequent and likely lead to altered patient treatment, especially at the thresholds of atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, where up to 50% of cases are misclassified. The causes underlying these errors remain largely unknown.  Technology similar to Google Maps now allows pan and zoom manipulation of high-resolution digital images of glass microscope slides. This technology has virtually replaced the microscope in medical schools and is rapidly diffusing into U.S. pathology practices. No research has evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' interpretion of digital images vs. glass slides. However, these ""digital slides"" offer a novel opportunity to study the accuracy, efficiency, and viewing behavior of a large number of pathologists as they manipulate and interpret images. The innovative analytic techniques proposed in this application are similar to those used to improve the performance of pilots and air traffic controllers. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Digital Image vs. Glass Slides: To compare the interpretive accuracy of pathologists viewing digitized slide images over the Internet to their performance viewing original glass slides under a microscope. A randomized national sample of pathologists (N=200) will interpret 240 test cases in one or both formats in two phases. Measures will include a diagnostic assessment for each test case and for digital slides, cursor- (i.e., mouse) tracking data and region of interest (ROI) markings. Completion of this aim will establish benchmarks for the comparative diagnostic accuracy of whole-slide digital images.  Aim 2. Interpretive Screening Behavior: To identify visual scanning patterns associated with diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Detailed simultaneous eye-tracking and cursor-tracking data will be collected on 60 additional pathologists while they interpret digital slides to complement data from Aim 1. Viewing patterns will be analyzed from computer representations of raw movement data. Videos depicting accurate, efficient visual scanning and cursor movement will be valuable tools in educating the next generation of digital pathologists. Aim 3. Image Analyses: To examine and classify the image characteristics (including color, texture, and structure) of ROIs captured in Aims 1 and 2. Computer-based statistical learning techniques will be used to identify image characteristics that lead to correct and incorrect diagnoses. Characteristics of both diagnostic and distracting ROIs will be identified, linking all three aims. In summary, we will determine whether digitized whole-slide images are diagnostically equivalent to original glass slides. Our in-depth scientific evaluation of viewing patterns and characteristics of ROIs identified by pathologists will be critical to understanding diagnostic errors and sources of distraction. Optimization of viewing techniques will improve diagnostic performance and thus, the quality of clinical care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pathologist errors in the interpretation of biopsy specimens can result in significant harm to patients. Digital imaging technology is rapidly diffusing into medical settings, providing a unique opportunity to obtain data on the process used by pathologists when interpreting slides.

"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induce stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quantitative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational image analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentially between rest and stress - that will identify myocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work wil involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,9212187,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Anatomy', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomechanics', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'perfusion imaging', 'public health relevance', 'radio frequency', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,768639,0.018696117306431188
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9244841,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'clinical imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2017,63883,-0.005286436766996672

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9350173,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,597688,0.030890820008482745
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9341177,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2017,579791,0.02254113798227515
"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,9021663,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'exercise program', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'student training', 'teaching assistant', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2016,59383,0.0003441810706845517
"Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study focuses on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) because, left untreated, it is the leading cause of blindness in the adult US population over 50. The goals of this program are twofold. First, the focus is to develop new screening tools to detect individuals with the intermediate stage of AMD, that are otherwise asymptomatic for vision loss, at a stage where they can be referred to a clinician for treatment and follow up, and when vision more likely can be preserved. The second goal is to develop Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) tools that help characterize Geographic Atrophy (GA), for which novel treatments are being investigated. We are developing data-driven algorithms for AMD screening which leverage recent advances in machine learning and machine intelligence and do not rely on detecting and counting or sizing drusen (a procedure which can be error prone). Instead, our method analyzes a fundus image as a whole using an image classification paradigm, and may also exploit ancillary patient information. Our goal is to use the AREDS dbGaP that includes thousands of images from hundreds of patients and offers a unique opportunity to develop and test these algorithms on a scale that has not previously been possible. Our team consists of the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, which will serve as the clinical analysis test site, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which will conduct the automated screening software tool analysis, development and testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are twofold. First, in order to work towards improving outcome, our goal is to develop novel software screening tools that allow for the automated detection of individuals with the intermediate stage AMD so that they may be referred to clinicians for follow up and treatment at an earlier stage than would otherwise occur. Second, we will develop new tools to characterize the evolution of GA, for which new treatments are being developed and tested.

"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).

"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples.

"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber. We propose to develop this into an ultraminiaturized microendoscope for functional brain imaging with minimal surgical damage in freely moving behaving animals.",Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals,9137657,R21EY026310,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Microscope', 'Miniaturization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Penetration', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imprint', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lens', 'microscopic imaging', 'miniaturize', 'minimally invasive', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'portability', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'targeted imaging', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NEI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2016,246750,-0.007473861129264964
"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project. After successfully fulfilling all of its aims, our framework for optimal multi-surface andor multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation was further extended, validated, and its practical utility demonstrated in clinical and translational image analysis tasks. This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. We propose to: 1) Develop 3D, 4D, and generally n-D approaches for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions (objects) and surfaces. 2) Develop methods for data-driven automated design of cost functions used for surface-based, region-based, and surface-and-region-based graph search image segmentation. 3) Develop ""Just-Enough-Interaction"" (JEI) approaches for efficient ""real-time"" medical image segmentation, thus achieving robust clinical applicability of quantitative medical image analysis. 4) Assess performance of all developed methods in translational research settings; determine performance in quantitative medical image analysis and radiation oncology treatment planning workflow. As a result, our project will enable routine quantification and therefore personalized care.

"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9064178,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,695446,0.0006507800079313289
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,9050682,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2016,339750,0.02287966113538247
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9176982,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2016,677628,0.01596931152997633
"Capti Screen Reading Assistant for Goal Directed Web Browsing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Web browsing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and magnifiers can often be a frustrating and challenging experience for people with vision impairments, because it entails a lot of searching for content, forms, and links that are required for doing online tasks such as shopping, bill-payment, reservations, etc. This SBIR Phase II project will build on Phase I results and will continue the development and eventual deployment of Capti Screen Reading Assistant - a next-generation assistive technology, enabling goal- directed web browsing for people with visual impairments. With Capti Assistant, users will be able to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals that are expressed in natural language (spoken or typed). The Assistant will lead the users step-by-step towards the fulfillment of these goals by offering suggestions on what action to take at every step of the way and automatically executing the chosen action on behalf of the user. Suggested actions will include operations such as form filling, activating controls (e.g., clicking buttons and links), et. Capti Assistant will dramatically reduce the time spent by people with visual impairments on performing tasks online. The Assistant will significantly improve the speed and efficiency with which they can interact with the Web, thereby, making people with disabilities more productive in today's web-based economy. Given a user browsing goal, expressed in a natural-language form, Capti Assistant will utilize a predictive model to guide the user toward the goal. The unique aspect of the Assistant is that its suggestions will be automatically learned from the user's own history of browsing actions and commands, as well as from the user's demonstration of how to accomplish browsing tasks that have not been done before. The Assistant will process user commands and present the suggested browsing actions to the user on demand, giving the user a choice between following the suggestions or continue browsing normally without accepting the suggestions. The functionality offered by the Assistant will go far beyond popular personal assistant applications such as Siri, which have not been designed specifically for people with vision impairments, and which cannot be used for ad hocweb browsing. Capti Assistant will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the Web. For them, the Assistant will usher in a new era of independence and employability in our global web-based economy. Thus, from a broader perspective, goal- directed browsing will exemplify the vision of the Universally Accessible Web whose thesis is ""equal access for all"", i.e. anyone should be able to reap the benefits of the Web without being constrained by any disability.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR Project seeks to do Research and Development on goal-directed web browsing - the next generation accessible technology that will empower people with vision impairments to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals, while the browser will do low-level operations (such as clicking on links and filling forms) necessary to fulfill these goals. Goal-directed browsing will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the web, thus improving independence and employability of the former in our global Web-based economy. From a broader perspective, goal-directed browsing will facilitate rehabilitation of people with disabilities and exemplify the vision of the Universally Accessible Web whose thesis is ""equal access for all"", enabling anyone to reap the benefits of the Web without being constrained by any disability.        ",Capti Screen Reading Assistant for Goal Directed Web Browsing,9048176,R44EY021962,"['Automation', 'Blindness', 'Budgets', 'Businesses', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FarGo', 'Focus Groups', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'In Situ', 'Information Retrieval', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Reservations', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Seasons', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'computer human interaction', 'design', 'disability', 'educational atmosphere', 'empowered', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'query optimization', 'research and development', 'response', 'success', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'usability', 'web page', 'web-accessible']",NEI,"CHARMTECH LABS, LLC",R44,2016,500000,-0.0222929472203623
"Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is diagnosed in approximately 124,000 people and is responsible for about 10,000 deaths every year, in the USA. Dermatologists rely on visual and dermatoscopic examination to discriminate benign melanocytic lesions from malignant, resulting in high and highly variable benign-to-malignant biopsy ratios from 8:1 to 47:1, and millions of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging has been proven for noninvasively guiding diagnosis of melanoma in several large clinical studies. RCM imaging at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) provides sensitivity of 92-88% and specificity of 71-84%. The specificity is 2 times superior to that of dermatoscopy. RCM imaging at the DEJ is now being implemented to rule out malignancy, reduce biopsy and guide treatment. However, this is currently at only a few sites, where there are highly trained experts who can ensure that imaging is appropriately performed and images are read correctly. These experts are a small international cohort of ""early adopter"" clinicians, who have worked with RCM technology during the past decade and have become highly skilled readers. For novice (non-expert) clinicians in the wider cohort who are keen to adopt RCM, learning to read images is challenging and requires substantial effort and time. Two major technical barriers underlie the dramatic variability in diagnostic accuracy among novice clinicians. Together they limit utility, reproducibility and wider adoption of RCM. The first is user dependent subjective variability in depths near the DEJ at which images are acquired, and the second is variability in interpretation of images. We propose to address these barriers with computational ""multi-faceted"" classification modeling (innovation), image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop and evaluate algorithms for both dermatoscopic images and RCM depth-stacks, to enable automated standardized and consistent acquisition of RCM mosaics at the DEJ in melanocytic lesions; (2) to develop and evaluate algorithms to discriminate patterns of cellular morphology at the DEJ into two classes, benign lesions versus malignant (dysplastic lesions and melanoma); and (3) to test our algorithms on patients for acquisition of RCM mosaics and classification into those two groups, with statistical validation against pathology, with statistical validation against pathology. Preliminary studies show that our algorithms can delineate the DEJ with accuracy in the range ~3-13 μm in strongly pigmented dark skin and ~5-20 μm in lightly pigmented fair skin, and can detect cellular morphologic patterns with sensitivity in the range 67-80% and specificity 78-99%. Melanocytic lesions can be distinguished from the surrounding normal skin at the DEJ with 80% classification accuracy. We are a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and University of Modena. Our success will produce standardized imaging and analysis approaches, to advance RCM for noninvasive detection of melanoma. Furthermore, these approaches can be useful for non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous lymphoma and other skin disorders (wider impact). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an optical imaging technology that can guide biopsy and enable noninvasive screening and diagnosis of skin cancers. However, visual reading and interpretation of RCM images requires substantial training for clinicians. We propose to develop computer-based algorithms to assist clinicians in reading images, serve as tools for training, and accelerate wider adoption of RCM technology by dermatologists.",Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy,9108343,R01CA199673,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cutaneous Lymphoma', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Glass', 'Health', 'Hypersensitivity skin testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Italy', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pigments', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specificity', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'melanoma', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optical imaging', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2016,618809,-0.020728860508636208

"Development of An Integrated High Throughput Imaging and Image Analysis Platform for Muscle ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is growing awareness that weakness of muscle is a significant biomedical health issue associated with many different chronic diseases and aging. There are a variety of different diseases that affect muscle, including muscular dystrophy, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis, each of which carries its own unique set of symptoms, accompanied by a myriad of genetic and molecular abnormalities. There is agreement within the basic research and clinical communities that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber cross sectional area, fiber type, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis are among many critical factors that determine the health and functionality of the muscle. Until now, the imaging equipment available is relatively low throughput and the quantification is still largely based on manual or, at best, semi-automatic methods that require extensive human intervention. In Phase I, CytoInformatics LLC has developed a software called CytoQuant, which can accurately perform automatic segmentation and provide accurate boundaries of each muscle fiber for a cropped image patch. The goal of CytoInformatics LLC in Phase II is to 1) deliver the first version of the CytoQuant software to the market, 2) develop the second version of CytoQuant by continuously improving its performance, especially in handling large scale, whole slide images, and also 3) develop an integrated multiplexing imaging hardware and analysis software framework as a seamless solution for high throughput, automated image analysis of muscle specimens. After careful investigation in Phase I (please refer to the details in business plan), we conclude that this integrated software/hardware platform with cutting-edge technologies in advanced imaging, large scale machine learning, and big data is commercially attractive to the entire muscle community including research institutes, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and athletic companies, demonstrated by strong enthusiasm among end users and many supporting letters. The specific aims are: 1) Deliver the first version of CytoQuant developed in Phase I to the market, continue to develop the second version of CytoQuant, which will focus on improving the robustness and speed in handling whole slide images; 2) Develop an integrated platform that provides unified imaging hardware and image analysis software to handle whole slide images labeled with multiple bio-relevant markers. This unified whole-slide based software and hardware solution will deliver an efficient and specialized imaging platform that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, multi-marker, and automatic image analysis software specifically designed for muscle.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In Phase II, CytoInformatics is proposing a unified whole-slide multispectral imaging (MSI) system that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, accurate, and automated software to provide fast and efficient, multiplexed imaging and quantitative muscle image analysis simultaneously.

"NRI: A Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid for the Visually Impaired PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The objective of the proposed research is to develop new technology for a Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid (W-ROMA) for the visually impaired. The W-ROMA is a hand-worn assistive device that provides assistance to a visually impaired individual in effectively grasping an object. Thanks to the onboard computer vision methods, the W-ROMA is capable of detecting a target object, determining the hand-object misalignment, and conveying to the wearer, via natural human-device interfaces, the desired hand motion for hand-object alignment. The W-ROMA will contribute to the independent lives of the visually impaired in twofold: First, it helps the visually impaired with independent travel by enabling them to identify a movable obstacle and manipulate the obstacle to make a passage. Second, it assists the visually impaired in effectively grasping an object for non-navigational purpose. The PIs will involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project and use the proposed project activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision and human-robot interaction methods that support accurate and effective object grasping for the visually impaired for their independent daily lives. These methods include: (1) a new real-time object recognition method; (2) an innovative hand-object alignment mechanism; (3) a novel hybrid tactile display system for object shape rendering; and (4) a computationally efficient device localization method. The proposed solutions can be encapsulated in a hand-worn robotic device. The W-ROMA will provide new co-robotic functions for the visually impaired. The PIs have performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision and tactile display methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the research will positively impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the proposed methods can be applied to other small robotic systems that have a wide range of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the PI's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics System for Muscle DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing.

"Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes new technology development and user studies aiming to facilitate the use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for blind people. Mobile OCR systems, implemented as smartphones apps, have recently appeared on the market. This technology unleashes the power of modern computer vision algorithms to enable a blind person to hear (via synthetic speech) the content of printed text imaged by the smartphone's camera. Unlike traditional OCR, that requires scanning of a document with a flatbed scanner, mobile OCR apps enable access to text anywhere, anytime. Using their own smartphones, blind people can read store receipts, menus, flyers, business cards, utility bills, and many other printed documents of the type normally encountered in everyday life. Unfortunately, current mobile OCR systems suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem, which limits their usability. They require the user to take a well-framed snapshot of the document to be scanned, with the full text in view, and at a close enough distance that each character can be well resolved and thus readable by the machine. However, taking a good picture of a document is difficult without sight, and thus without the ability to look at the scene being imaged by the camera through the smartphone's screen. Anecdotal evidence, supported by results of preliminary studies conducted by the principal investigator's group, confirms that acquisition of an OCR-readable image of a document can indeed by very challenging for some blind users. We plan to address this problem by developing and testing a new technique of assisted mobile OCR. As the user aims the camera at the document, the system analyzes in real time the stream of images acquired by the camera, and determines how the camera position and orientation should be adjusted so that an OCR-readable image of the document can be acquired. This information is conveyed to the user via a specially designed acoustic signal. This acoustic feedback allows users to quickly adjust and reorient the camera or the document, resulting in reduced access time and in more satisfactory user experience. Multiple user studies with blind participants are planned with the purpose of selecting an appropriate acoustic interface and of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed assisted mobile OCR modality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is concerned with the development of new technology designed to facilitate use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems to access printed text without sight. Specifically, this exploratory research will develop and test a novel system that, by means of a specially designed acoustic interface, will help a blind person take a well-framed, well-resolved image of a document for OCR processing using a smartphone or wearable camera. If successful, this novel approach to assisted mobile OCR will reduce access time and improve user experience of blind mobile OCR users.",Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR,8989105,R21EY025077,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Augmented Reality', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chickens', 'Clothing', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Marketing', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Report (document)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Restaurants', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Development Study', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'blind', 'design', 'egg', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'optical character recognition', 'research study', 'technology development', 'usability', 'way finding']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2016,230563,0.004184835318483458
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.                ",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9030162,R01EY025332,"['3D Print', 'Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2016,416574,0.005271966283630947
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induce stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quantitative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational image analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentially between rest and stress - that will identify myocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work wil involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,9002898,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'radio frequency', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,776460,0.018696117306431188
"Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1.4 million women per year depend on pathologists to accurately interpret breast biopsies for a diagnosis of benign disease or cancer. Diagnostic errors are alarmingly frequent and likely lead to altered patient treatment, especially at the thresholds of atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, where up to 50% of cases are misclassified. The causes underlying these errors remain largely unknown.  Technology similar to Google Maps now allows pan and zoom manipulation of high-resolution digital images of glass microscope slides. This technology has virtually replaced the microscope in medical schools and is rapidly diffusing into U.S. pathology practices. No research has evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' interpretion of digital images vs. glass slides. However, these ""digital slides"" offer a novel opportunity to study the accuracy, efficiency, and viewing behavior of a large number of pathologists as they manipulate and interpret images. The innovative analytic techniques proposed in this application are similar to those used to improve the performance of pilots and air traffic controllers. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Digital Image vs. Glass Slides: To compare the interpretive accuracy of pathologists viewing digitized slide images over the Internet to their performance viewing original glass slides under a microscope. A randomized national sample of pathologists (N=200) will interpret 240 test cases in one or both formats in two phases. Measures will include a diagnostic assessment for each test case and for digital slides, cursor- (i.e., mouse) tracking data and region of interest (ROI) markings. Completion of this aim will establish benchmarks for the comparative diagnostic accuracy of whole-slide digital images.  Aim 2. Interpretive Screening Behavior: To identify visual scanning patterns associated with diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Detailed simultaneous eye-tracking and cursor-tracking data will be collected on 60 additional pathologists while they interpret digital slides to complement data from Aim 1. Viewing patterns will be analyzed from computer representations of raw movement data. Videos depicting accurate, efficient visual scanning and cursor movement will be valuable tools in educating the next generation of digital pathologists. Aim 3. Image Analyses: To examine and classify the image characteristics (including color, texture, and structure) of ROIs captured in Aims 1 and 2. Computer-based statistical learning techniques will be used to identify image characteristics that lead to correct and incorrect diagnoses. Characteristics of both diagnostic and distracting ROIs will be identified, linking all three aims. In summary, we will determine whether digitized whole-slide images are diagnostically equivalent to original glass slides. Our in-depth scientific evaluation of viewing patterns and characteristics of ROIs identified by pathologists will be critical to understanding diagnostic errors and sources of distraction. Optimization of viewing techniques will improve diagnostic performance and thus, the quality of clinical care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pathologist errors in the interpretation of biopsy specimens can result in significant harm to patients. Digital imaging technology is rapidly diffusing into medical settings, providing a unique opportunity to obtain data on the process used by pathologists when interpreting slides. The results will provide the foundation needed to improve interpretive accuracy and efficiency, support quality improvement efforts, and ultimately reduce the burden of misdiagnosis on patients and the health care delivery system.",Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization,8970690,R01CA172343,"['Adoption', 'Air', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Atypical hyperplasia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast biopsy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Rural Hospitals', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Evaluation', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative', 'computer monitor', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital media', 'distraction', 'eye hand coordination', 'health care delivery', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'migration', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,624643,-0.0021894730552987937
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9044803,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2016,63620,-0.005286436766996672
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training.

"Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract: Advances in imaging technology offer great opportunities to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways that are not previously possible. This leads to various large-scale imaging studies, i.e., ADNI, for discovering AD-related imaging biomarkers. In these imaging studies, image registration plays a key role in reducing the confounding inter-subject variability and also enhancing the statistical power of identifying abnormalities related to AD. However, automated processing of large-scale imaging data, i.e., involving anything from hundreds to thousands of 3D brain images, is not trivial and requires dedicated computational tools. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going large-scale imaging study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration method will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch. Our key idea is to break down the complex groupwise registration problem into hierarchical sets of small- scale registration tasks that can be solved easily, thus making the large-scale registration more manageable and fast. Specifically, 1) for fast initialization of large-scale groupwise registration of brain images, we will develop in Aim 1 a hierarchical learning-based landmark detection algorithm, based on random forest regression, to detect salient anatomical landmarks and then jointly align all images with detected landmarks. Since all images are distributed in a complex manifold and also the registration of similar images is much faster and more accurate, we propose to first build a graph to link each image only with similar images, and then formulate groupwise registration as dynamic graph shrinkage. This avoids direct registration of each image to the group-mean image as done in the conventional methods, thus improving both speed and accuracy. 2) To significantly speed up and also improve this single-layer graph-based groupwise registration, we will further develop in Aim 2 a deep multi-layer groupwise registration by simultaneous layer-by-layer graph construction and layer-wise registration. 3) Finally, to significantly increase both the speed and accuracy of registration for new images acquired from on-going large-scale imaging study, we will develop in Aim 3 a novel incremental groupwise registration method to reuse previous registration results of existing images for guiding registration of new images. Specifically, each new image can be quickly registered to the common space of existing images by finding its most similar existing image(s). Accordingly, all new and existing images will become similar in the common space and then can be quickly updated for their overall groupwise registration. All computational tools developed will be made freely available to the research community, for accelerating the imaging study of Alzheimer's disease. Narrative Description of Project Modern imaging techniques offer great opportunities to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways that are not previously possible. This leads to increasing number of large-scale imaging studies, including ADNI. However, the overwhelmingly big data poses new challenges to researchers in automated data processing. Thus, modern computational tools are expected to be able to handle the vast amount of data within a manageable time frame. In light of this, we aim to solve this large-scale spatial registration problem – a critical step directly related to accuracy and precision of imaging biomarkers to be discovered for AD. In particular, we will develop novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch. The development of these advanced computational tools will eventually benefit for discovery of new imaging biomarkers for AD.",Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease,9240850,RF1AG053867,"['Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appearance', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mainstreaming', 'Methods', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'empowered', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'rapid technique']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,RF1,2016,2485857,-0.06360125025477095
"Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An online community called EyeWire proved that volunteers can be motivated to reconstruct neural circuits through an activity resembling a 3D coloring book. EyeWire helped discover space-time speciﬁcity of the wiring from bipolar cells to starburst amacrine cells, which suggested a surprising new model for direction selectivity in the retina. Motivated by this success, we are preparing to launch EyeWire II, which aims to map the entire retinal connectome, yielding the ﬁrst complete wiring diagram for any region of the mammalian CNS. This ambitious goal will require innovative advances in virtually every component of EyeWire. The underlying electron microscopic image of the retina will be replaced by a new image with increased size and quality. A new artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) will be trained using a new software package for 3D deep learning. While the improved AI is expected to reduce the amount of human effort required to reconstruct a neuron, the number of neurons targeted for reconstruction will also increase dramatically. Overall, the absolute amount of human effort required will increase rather than decrease. Therefore it is critical to improve EyeWire's crowdsourcing to (1) mobilize more human effort and (2) to use human effort more efﬁciently. This project aims to radically improve both aspects, thereby making the retinal connectome achievable by EyeWire II. In Aim 1, we will create a compelling mobile game with the target of engaging 10x more people than the existing EyeWire community. In Aim 2, we will develop and deploy new crowdsourcing algorithms that extract wisdom from the crowd by weighted voting and optimally assign players to tasks. The Aims will be achieved through collaboration between three organizations. Wired Differently, Inc. (WD) is a new Boston-based nonproﬁt organization dedicated to ""citizen neuroscience"" that was recently spun out of MIT. WD currently operates EyeWire in collaboration with the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. The Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at Carnegie Mellon University will offer a project-based class to its master's students to design and prototype new ideas for the mobile game. Both Aims will produce code and algorithms that will be made publicly available, and could have broad impact on citizen science. As the ﬁrst crowdsourcing of 3D image analysis, the code produced by Aim 1 could be useful for the many other kinds of 3D images found in biomedical research. The crowdsourcing algorithms of Aim 2 are potentially useful for any citizen science project facing the challenge of obtaining accurate and reliable results from a heterogeneous group of volunteers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeWire II will increase public understanding of the structure of the nervous system. The retinal connectome could aid those attempting to develop blindness therapies based on regenerating cells and their wiring. It could also aid the development of retinal prosthetics that directly stimulate ganglion cells and computationally emulate the bypassed micro circuitry. 1        ",Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II,9076876,UH2CA203710,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Books', 'Boston', 'Breathing', 'Bypass', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Love', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Volunteer Group', 'Voting', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'online community', 'pleasure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'retinal prosthesis', 'simulation', 'starburst amacrine cell', 'success', 'university student', 'visual neuroscience', 'volunteer']",NCI,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,320900,0.007193137086406221
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9119513,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,597688,0.030890820008482745
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9145647,U24CA199374,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2016,605366,0.02254113798227515
"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8813596,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2015,59383,0.0003441810706845517
"Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study focuses on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) because, left untreated, it is the leading cause of blindness in the adult US population over 50. The goals of this program are twofold. First, the focus is to develop new screening tools to detect individuals with the intermediate stage of AMD, that are otherwise asymptomatic for vision loss, at a stage where they can be referred to a clinician for treatment and follow up, and when vision more likely can be preserved. The second goal is to develop Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) tools that help characterize Geographic Atrophy (GA), for which novel treatments are being investigated. We are developing data-driven algorithms for AMD screening which leverage recent advances in machine learning and machine intelligence and do not rely on detecting and counting or sizing drusen (a procedure which can be error prone). Instead, our method analyzes a fundus image as a whole using an image classification paradigm, and may also exploit ancillary patient information. Our goal is to use the AREDS dbGaP that includes thousands of images from hundreds of patients and offers a unique opportunity to develop and test these algorithms on a scale that has not previously been possible. Our team consists of the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, which will serve as the clinical analysis test site, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which will conduct the automated screening software tool analysis, development and testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are twofold. First, in order to work towards improving outcome, our goal is to develop novel software screening tools that allow for the automated detection of individuals with the intermediate stage AMD so that they may be referred to clinicians for follow up and treatment at an earlier stage than would otherwise occur. Second, we will develop new tools to characterize the evolution of GA, for which new treatments are being developed and tested.

"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our popular, user-friendly, open-source image analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org), to accommodate the increasing scale and scope of modern microscopy experiments.",Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software,8910751,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cellular imaging', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2015,589523,0.059120115214033764
"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms. Microscopy screens of cultured cells are routine, but researchers wish to study complex processes like metabolism and infection in a whole animal like the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which existing image analysis methods are insufficient. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to automatically identify and measure C. elegans in microscopy images, thereby making it possible for researchers worldwide to screen a wide variety of complex biological processes related to human disease.",Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays,8786567,R01GM095672,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Businesses', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data Quality', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Excision', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Microsporidia', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Engineering', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'body system', 'chemical genetics', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'follow-up', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'interest', 'lipid metabolism', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2015,309263,0.03506988641268671
"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber. We propose to develop this into an ultraminiaturized microendoscope for functional brain imaging with minimal surgical damage in freely moving behaving animals.            ",Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals,9053610,R21EY026310,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Miniaturization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Penetration', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imprint', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lens', 'miniaturize', 'minimally invasive', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'targeted imaging', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NEI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2015,239361,-0.007473861129264964
"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project. After successfully fulfilling all of its aims, our framework for optimal multi-surface andor multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation was further extended, validated, and its practical utility demonstrated in clinical and translational image analysis tasks. This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. We propose to: 1) Develop 3D, 4D, and generally n-D approaches for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions (objects) and surfaces. 2) Develop methods for data-driven automated design of cost functions used for surface-based, region-based, and surface-and-region-based graph search image segmentation. 3) Develop ""Just-Enough-Interaction"" (JEI) approaches for efficient ""real-time"" medical image segmentation, thus achieving robust clinical applicability of quantitative medical image analysis. 4) Assess performance of all developed methods in translational research settings; determine performance in quantitative medical image analysis and radiation oncology treatment planning workflow. As a result, our project will enable routine quantification and therefore personalized care.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8906912,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,685014,0.0006507800079313289
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8842639,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2015,332955,0.02287966113538247
"Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is diagnosed in approximately 124,000 people and is responsible for about 10,000 deaths every year, in the USA. Dermatologists rely on visual and dermatoscopic examination to discriminate benign melanocytic lesions from malignant, resulting in high and highly variable benign-to-malignant biopsy ratios from 8:1 to 47:1, and millions of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging has been proven for noninvasively guiding diagnosis of melanoma in several large clinical studies. RCM imaging at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) provides sensitivity of 92-88% and specificity of 71-84%. The specificity is 2 times superior to that of dermatoscopy. RCM imaging at the DEJ is now being implemented to rule out malignancy, reduce biopsy and guide treatment. However, this is currently at only a few sites, where there are highly trained experts who can ensure that imaging is appropriately performed and images are read correctly. These experts are a small international cohort of ""early adopter"" clinicians, who have worked with RCM technology during the past decade and have become highly skilled readers. For novice (non-expert) clinicians in the wider cohort who are keen to adopt RCM, learning to read images is challenging and requires substantial effort and time. Two major technical barriers underlie the dramatic variability in diagnostic accuracy among novice clinicians. Together they limit utility, reproducibility and wider adoption of RCM. The first is user dependent subjective variability in depths near the DEJ at which images are acquired, and the second is variability in interpretation of images. We propose to address these barriers with computational ""multi-faceted"" classification modeling (innovation), image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop and evaluate algorithms for both dermatoscopic images and RCM depth-stacks, to enable automated standardized and consistent acquisition of RCM mosaics at the DEJ in melanocytic lesions; (2) to develop and evaluate algorithms to discriminate patterns of cellular morphology at the DEJ into two classes, benign lesions versus malignant (dysplastic lesions and melanoma); and (3) to test our algorithms on patients for acquisition of RCM mosaics and classification into those two groups, with statistical validation against pathology, with statistical validation against pathology. Preliminary studies show that our algorithms can delineate the DEJ with accuracy in the range ~3-13 μm in strongly pigmented dark skin and ~5-20 μm in lightly pigmented fair skin, and can detect cellular morphologic patterns with sensitivity in the range 67-80% and specificity 78-99%. Melanocytic lesions can be distinguished from the surrounding normal skin at the DEJ with 80% classification accuracy. We are a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and University of Modena. Our success will produce standardized imaging and analysis approaches, to advance RCM for noninvasive detection of melanoma. Furthermore, these approaches can be useful for non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous lymphoma and other skin disorders (wider impact).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an optical imaging technology that can guide biopsy and enable noninvasive screening and diagnosis of skin cancers. However, visual reading and interpretation of RCM images requires substantial training for clinicians.

"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.            ",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies,9072725,R01EB021900,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'Underrepresented Students', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccines', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'compliance behavior', 'data exchange', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'disease transmission', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'image processing', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'social inequality', 'telehealth', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2015,299984,0.017751121565615962
"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids. The PI's team has performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision methods and the results are promising.

"NRI: A Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid for the Visually Impaired PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The objective of the proposed research is to develop new technology for a Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid (W-ROMA) for the visually impaired. The W-ROMA is a hand-worn assistive device that provides assistance to a visually impaired individual in effectively grasping an object. Thanks to the onboard computer vision methods, the W-ROMA is capable of detecting a target object, determining the hand-object misalignment, and conveying to the wearer, via natural human-device interfaces, the desired hand motion for hand-object alignment. The W-ROMA will contribute to the independent lives of the visually impaired in twofold: First, it helps the visually impaired with independent travel by enabling them to identify a movable obstacle and manipulate the obstacle to make a passage. Second, it assists the visually impaired in effectively grasping an object for non-navigational purpose. The PIs will involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project and use the proposed project activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision and human-robot interaction methods that support accurate and effective object grasping for the visually impaired for their independent daily lives. These methods include: (1) a new real-time object recognition method; (2) an innovative hand-object alignment mechanism; (3) a novel hybrid tactile display system for object shape rendering; and (4) a computationally efficient device localization method. The proposed solutions can be encapsulated in a hand-worn robotic device. The W-ROMA will provide new co-robotic functions for the visually impaired. The PIs have performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision and tactile display methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the research will positively impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the proposed methods can be applied to other small robotic systems that have a wide range of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the PI's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ideally, as neuroscientists collect terabytes of image stacks, the data are automatically processed for open access and analysis. Yet, while several labs around the world are collecting data at unprecedented rates- up to terabytes per day-the computational technologies that facilitate streaming data-intensive computing remain absent. Also deploying data-intensive compute clusters is beyond the means and abilities of most experimental labs. This project will extend, develop, and deploy such technologies. To demonstrate these tools, we will utilize them in support of the ongoing mouse brain architecture (MBA) project, which already has amassed over 0.5 petabytes (PBs) of image data. The main computational challenges posed by these datasets are ones of scale. The tasks that follow remain relatively stereotyped across acquisition modalities. Until now, labs collecting data on this scale have been almost entirely isolated, left to ""reinvent the wheel"" for each of these problems. Moreover, the extant solutions are insufficient for a number of reasons: they often include numerous excel spreadsheets that rely on manual data entry, they lack scalable scientific database backends, and they run on ad hoc clusters not specifically designed for the computational tasks at hand. We aim to augment the current state of the art by implementing the following technological advancements into the MBA project pipeline: (1) Data Management will consist of a unified system that automatically captures metadata, launches processing pipelines, and provides quality control feedback in minutes instead of hours. (2) Data Processing tasks will run algorithms ""out-of-core"", appropriate for their computational requirements, including registration, alignment, and semantic segmentation of cell bodies and processes. (3) Data Storage will automatically build databases for storing multimodal image data and extracted annotations learned from the machine vision algorithms. These databases will be spatially co-registered and stored on an optimized heterogeneous compute cluster. (4) Data Access will be automatically available to everyone-including all the image data and data derived products-via Web-services, including 3D viewing, downloading, and further processing. (5) Data Analytics will extend random graph models suitable for multiscale circuit graphs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Nervous system disorders are responsible for approximately 30% of the total burden of illness in the United States. Whole brain neuroanatomy-available from massive neuroscientific image stacks-is widely believed to be a key missing link in our ability to prevent and treat such illnesses. Thus, this project aims to close this gap via the development and application of BIGDATA tools for management, storage, access, and analytics. n/a",BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci,8792208,R01DA036400,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Cell physiology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Feedback', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Stereotyping', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States', 'Vision', 'burden of illness', 'cluster computing', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized data processing', 'data management', 'design', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal cell body', 'prevent', 'tool', 'web services']",NIDA,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2015,248295,0.02425970712308547
"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays.  This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment.  No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents.  Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image.  For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast.  These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view.  Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users.  Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures.  The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.  The proposed research would result in a smartphone/tablet-based assistive technology system (available for free) to provide increased access to such display information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users,8916115,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blindness', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Location', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'information display', 'interest', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'prototype']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2015,368560,0.00823578164455481
"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,8922953,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2015,314327,0.047485343480496066
"Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral venous access is pivotal to a wide range of clinical interventions and is consequently the leading cause of medical injury in the U.S. Complications associated with the procedure are exacerbated in difficult settings, where the rate of success depends heavily on the patient's physiology and the practitioner's experience. My dissertation thesis pertains to the development of imaging and robotic technologies to improve the accuracy and speed of blood draws and IV's. The core technology is an image-guided robotic device that accurately and autonomously introduces a cannula for venous access. The device operates by mapping in real-time the 3D structure of peripheral veins in order to robotically direct a needle into a selected vein. A working prototype has been developed and validated in several studies, the results of which are described in two journal publications. The device combines a 3D near-infrared vein imager, a robot, and computer vision software; these three components form the basis of the three Specific Aims described in this proposal. The Aims fit into the overall dissertation by 1) incorporating the current imaging hardware into a standalone, handheld imaging device; 2) introducing software for the imaging device that assists in selecting suitable cannulation sites; and 3) integrating the imaging device and software with a miniaturized version of the current robot. The outcome of this work will be a compact and low-cost system that is suited for beta-stage development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood draws and IV therapies are one of the most commonly performed medical routines in hospitals and clinics. Injuries to doctors and patients happen frequently because of how difficult it can be to find veins and accurately insert the needle. We are developing a portable and lightweight medical robot to perform the procedure in situations where the doctor is unable to successfully access the veins. This device may greatly improve the safety and accuracy of venous access, and has wide applications in many clinical areas.","Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea",8832591,F31EB018191,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood', 'Cannulas', 'Cannulations', 'Catheters', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Emergency Care', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Motivation', 'Needles', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Sprague-Dawley Rats', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'image guided', 'imaging software', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'robotic device', 'skeletal', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F31,2015,32250,-0.009909357958499244
"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy.

"Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes new technology development and user studies aiming to facilitate the use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for blind people. Mobile OCR systems, implemented as smartphones apps, have recently appeared on the market. This technology unleashes the power of modern computer vision algorithms to enable a blind person to hear (via synthetic speech) the content of printed text imaged by the smartphone's camera. Unlike traditional OCR, that requires scanning of a document with a flatbed scanner, mobile OCR apps enable access to text anywhere, anytime. Using their own smartphones, blind people can read store receipts, menus, flyers, business cards, utility bills, and many other printed documents of the type normally encountered in everyday life. Unfortunately, current mobile OCR systems suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem, which limits their usability. They require the user to take a well-framed snapshot of the document to be scanned, with the full text in view, and at a close enough distance that each character can be well resolved and thus readable by the machine. However, taking a good picture of a document is difficult without sight, and thus without the ability to look at the scene being imaged by the camera through the smartphone's screen. Anecdotal evidence, supported by results of preliminary studies conducted by the principal investigator's group, confirms that acquisition of an OCR-readable image of a document can indeed by very challenging for some blind users. We plan to address this problem by developing and testing a new technique of assisted mobile OCR. As the user aims the camera at the document, the system analyzes in real time the stream of images acquired by the camera, and determines how the camera position and orientation should be adjusted so that an OCR-readable image of the document can be acquired. This information is conveyed to the user via a specially designed acoustic signal. This acoustic feedback allows users to quickly adjust and reorient the camera or the document, resulting in reduced access time and in more satisfactory user experience. Multiple user studies with blind participants are planned with the purpose of selecting an appropriate acoustic interface and of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed assisted mobile OCR modality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is concerned with the development of new technology designed to facilitate use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems to access printed text without sight. Specifically, this exploratory research will develop and test a novel system that, by means of a specially designed acoustic interface, will help a blind person take a well-framed, well-resolved image of a document for OCR processing using a smartphone or wearable camera. If successful, this novel approach to assisted mobile OCR will reduce access time and improve user experience of blind mobile OCR users.                ",Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR,8812658,R21EY025077,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chickens', 'Clothing', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Marketing', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Report (document)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Restaurants', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Development Study', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'blind', 'design', 'egg', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'technology development', 'usability', 'way finding']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2015,191510,0.004184835318483458
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1.4 million women per year depend on pathologists to accurately interpret breast biopsies for a diagnosis of benign disease or cancer. Diagnostic errors are alarmingly frequent and likely lead to altered patient treatment, especially at the thresholds of atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, where up to 50% of cases are misclassified. The causes underlying these errors remain largely unknown.  Technology similar to Google Maps now allows pan and zoom manipulation of high-resolution digital images of glass microscope slides. This technology has virtually replaced the microscope in medical schools and is rapidly diffusing into U.S. pathology practices. No research has evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' interpretion of digital images vs. glass slides. However, these ""digital slides"" offer a novel opportunity to study the accuracy, efficiency, and viewing behavior of a large number of pathologists as they manipulate and interpret images. The innovative analytic techniques proposed in this application are similar to those used to improve the performance of pilots and air traffic controllers. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Digital Image vs. Glass Slides: To compare the interpretive accuracy of pathologists viewing digitized slide images over the Internet to their performance viewing original glass slides under a microscope. A randomized national sample of pathologists (N=200) will interpret 240 test cases in one or both formats in two phases. Measures will include a diagnostic assessment for each test case and for digital slides, cursor- (i.e., mouse) tracking data and region of interest (ROI) markings. Completion of this aim will establish benchmarks for the comparative diagnostic accuracy of whole-slide digital images.  Aim 2. Interpretive Screening Behavior: To identify visual scanning patterns associated with diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Detailed simultaneous eye-tracking and cursor-tracking data will be collected on 60 additional pathologists while they interpret digital slides to complement data from Aim 1. Viewing patterns will be analyzed from computer representations of raw movement data. Videos depicting accurate, efficient visual scanning and cursor movement will be valuable tools in educating the next generation of digital pathologists. Aim 3. Image Analyses: To examine and classify the image characteristics (including color, texture, and structure) of ROIs captured in Aims 1 and 2. Computer-based statistical learning techniques will be used to identify image characteristics that lead to correct and incorrect diagnoses. Characteristics of both diagnostic and distracting ROIs will be identified, linking all three aims. In summary, we will determine whether digitized whole-slide images are diagnostically equivalent to original glass slides. Our in-depth scientific evaluation of viewing patterns and characteristics of ROIs identified by pathologists will be critical to understanding diagnostic errors and sources of distraction. Optimization of viewing techniques will improve diagnostic performance and thus, the quality of clinical care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pathologist errors in the interpretation of biopsy specimens can result in significant harm to patients. Digital imaging technology is rapidly diffusing into medical settings, providing a unique opportunity to obtain data on the process used by pathologists when interpreting slides. The results will provide the foundation needed to improve interpretive accuracy and efficiency, support quality improvement efforts, and ultimately reduce the burden of misdiagnosis on patients and the health care delivery system.",Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization,8771432,R01CA172343,"['Adoption', 'Air', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Atypical hyperplasia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast biopsy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Rural Hospitals', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Evaluation', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative', 'computer monitor', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'distraction', 'eye hand coordination', 'health care delivery', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'migration', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,639475,-0.0021894730552987937
"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induce stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quantitative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational image analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentially between rest and stress - that will identify myocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work wil involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,8807942,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'radio frequency', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,767996,0.018696117306431188
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.                 ",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,8854343,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2015,63363,-0.005286436766996672
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training. The statistical inference techniques developed can be applicable to genetic epidemiology, health economics, and bioinformatics.",SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic*,8934115,R01EB020426,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Elastic Tissue', 'Elasticity', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life Style', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammary Ultrasonography', 'Mammography', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening for cancer', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Societies', 'Staging', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'design', 'evidence base', 'genetic epidemiology', 'health economics', 'image registration', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant stomach neoplasm', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prostate biopsy', 'prototype', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,214237,-0.013881839298143158
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,8887334,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,591379,0.030890820008482745
"Multimodal image registration by proxy image synthesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Image registration is a fundamentally important capability in modern neuroscience and clinical medicine. Normalization in functional imaging studies, studies of shape changes in growth, aging, and disease, overlaying surgical plans on intraoperative images, and geometric distortion correction are examples of important applications of image registration. There are dozens of needs for registration in both intrasubject and intersubject applications as well. Therefore, any improvement in image registration performance will have an immediate impact on the scientific and clinical communities. Despite numerous advances in image reconstruction algorithms, the use of multiple modalities (or tissue contrasts) to carry out image registration is a virtually untapped area. The vastly dominant framework is to register a single image of the subject to another single image of the target, and if multiple images are available of either subject or target, they are registered by using the transformation derived from the single image registration. The proposed research will develop, evaluate, and validate a very simply explained but quite radical idea for multi-modal registration. The basic idea is to synthesize a ""proxy"" image from the subject image that has the same tissue contrast and intensity range as the target image and then use a conventional metric such as sum-of-square difference to carry out the registration between the subject proxy and target. Preliminary results demonstrate significant benefits in this approach. In the grant we will: 1) Optimize ""proxy"" multimodal image registration by exploring its theoretical justification as well a key parameters of the overall approach; 2) Apply ""proxy"" multimodal image registration to three key applications in neuroscience in order to validate the method and develop principles of best practice; and 3) Write open source software to carry out image synthesis, similarity computation, and rigid and deformable registration using the ""proxy"" image concept. Both the software to synthesize images for use in a user's favorite image registration method as well as software to carry out the entire ""proxy"" registration process in an optimized way will be made publicly available as open source computer code. The results of this research will lead to a new era in image registration by changing the way researchers and practitioners acquire and use data for neuroscientific studies and clinical medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical image registration is a method used throughout clinical medicine and medical research and it is vital to the success of many treatments and therapies and for answering a myriad of important scientific questions. This research will permit better alignment by devising and testing a new similarity criterion for multimodal images using the first significantly new approach in over a decade. The result will be better alignment of these images, which will enable better clinical diagnosis and prognosis and more significant research discoveries.

"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.                ","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",8970326,U24CA199374,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2015,606305,0.02254113798227515
"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user. The project addresses the need of approximately 1 % of our world's population, including millions of Americans, who rely on wheelchair for mobility.             ",NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair,8838311,R01NR015371,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Build-it', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Disabled Persons', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Glass', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual Motion', 'Wheelchairs', 'aging population', 'base', 'improved', 'operation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor']",NINR,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2014,155663,-0.023359995920733727
"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. !         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.             ",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8628140,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2014,59383,0.0003441810706845517
"Intelligent and Automatic Image Segmentation Software for High ThroughputAnalysi     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well established that aging and many chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart failure, are associated with significant losses in skeletal muscle mass and strength in humans. There is agreement across the muscle biology community that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health and function of the muscle. However, at this time, quantification of muscle characteristics from standard histological and immunohistological techniques is still a manual or, at best, a semi-automatic process. This process is labor intensive and can be prone to errors, leading to high inter-observer variability. On the other hand, when muscle characteristics are calculated by computer-aided image analysis, data acquisition times decrease and objectivity improves significantly. The objective of this Phase I STTR project is to build a fully automatic, intelligent, and high throughput image acquisition and analysis software for quantitative muscle morphological analysis on digitized muscle cross-sections. We propose to utilize the most recent technical advances in machine learning and biomedical image analysis. This includes a newly developed deformable model and mean-shift based seed detection algorithm for better segmentation accuracy; an asymmetric online boosting based machine learning algorithm which allows the software to learn from errors and adjust its segmentation strategies adaptively; and a data parallelization schema using the graphic processing unit (GPU) to handle the computational bottleneck for extremely large scale image, such as whole slide scanned specimens. We believe that this software, equipped with the most advanced technical innovations, will be commercially attractive for the skeletal muscle research community including basic scientists, clinician scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry. The specific aim are: 1) Develop, implement, and validate an automatic biological image analysis software package for skeletal muscle tissue; 2) Develop a novel online updated intelligent artificial intelligence unit to enable the software to learn from errors; 3) Build a novel high performance computing unit to enable fast and high throughput automatic image analysis, which is capable of processing whole slide scanned muscle specimens. The analysis approach proposed will provide more consistent, accurate, and objective quantification of skeletal muscle morphological properties and the time for data analysis will be reduced by over a factor of 100 for standalone version and 2000 for parallel version. The long-term goal of Cytoinformatics, LLC for the Phase II stage is to apply the software to analyze histology/pathology from human muscle biopsy samples and extension of the software to other biological tissues, such as adipose tissue.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Important features of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health of the muscle. However quantification of muscle features from digitized images is still a manual or, at best, a semi-automatic process.

"Automated retinopathy of prematurity classification using machine learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a web-based, semi-automated system for identifying severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with ""plus disease,"" using an existing data set of retinal images collected from previous NIH-funded research studies. ROP is treatable if diagnosed early, yet continues to be a leading cause of childhood blindness throughout the world. Diagnosis and documentation of ophthalmoscopic findings in ROP are subjective and qualitative, and studies have found that there is often significant diagnostic variation, even when experts are shown the exact same clinical data. Computer-based image analysis and the application of machine learning techniques to feature extraction and image classification have potential to address many of these limitations. Recent advances in image processing have had led to sophisticated techniques for tracing vessel-like structures. Additionally, machine-learning techniques will enable us to leverage these existing annotated image databases to improve the performance of our algorithms for vessel segmentation and disease classification. Our overall hypothesis is that retinal vascular features may be quantified and used to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of ROP. These hypotheses will be tested using two Specific Aims: (1) Develop and evaluate semi-automated algorithms to segment retinal vessels and generate a set of retinal vessel-based features. (2) Develop computer-based decision support algorithms that best correlate with expert opinions. Overall, this project will build upon infrastructure developed from previous studies, create potential for improving the accuracy and consistency of clinical ROP diagnosis, provide a demonstration of computer-based decision support from image analysis during real-world medical care, and stimulate future research toward understanding the vascular features associated with severe ROP. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators with expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, machine learning, and image processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the United States and throughout the world, and current diagnostic and documentation methods are often subjective and qualitative.

"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our popular, user-friendly, open-source image analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org), to accommodate the increasing scale and scope of modern microscopy experiments.            ",Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software,8761195,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cellular imaging', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2014,522488,0.059120115214033764
"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms. Microscopy screens of cultured cells are routine, but researchers wish to study complex processes like metabolism and infection in a whole animal like the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which existing image analysis methods are insufficient. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to automatically identify and measure C. elegans in microscopy images, thereby making it possible for researchers worldwide to screen a wide variety of complex biological processes related to human disease.

"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem addressed in this proposal is the development and evaluation of an automated noninvasive approach to discriminate different normal and pathological tissue types using machine learning algorithms; previous applications of machine learning have been based on features of the backscattered ultrasound that are essentially energy based. Our approach will be based on extracting features from images whose pixels are determined by the entropy contained in segments of the backscattered ultrasound. The unique attributes of entropy imaging suggest that the automated analysis we propose would be particularly robust for discrimination of deep tissues in a clinical environment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics. In this approach the entropy of the backscattered segment is used to produce a pixel value in the tissue image. This processing strategy has proven to be sensitive to weak, sub-resolution sized changes in tissue.

"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project. After successfully fulfilling all of its aims, our framework for optimal multi-surface andor multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation was further extended, validated, and its practical utility demonstrated in clinical and translational image analysis tasks. This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. We propose to: 1) Develop 3D, 4D, and generally n-D approaches for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions (objects) and surfaces. 2) Develop methods for data-driven automated design of cost functions used for surface-based, region-based, and surface-and-region-based graph search image segmentation. 3) Develop ""Just-Enough-Interaction"" (JEI) approaches for efficient ""real-time"" medical image segmentation, thus achieving robust clinical applicability of quantitative medical image analysis. 4) Assess performance of all developed methods in translational research settings; determine performance in quantitative medical image analysis and radiation oncology treatment planning workflow. As a result, our project will enable routine quantification and therefore personalized care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Phases I and II of this research project multi-surface and/or multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation and demonstrated its practical utility.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8916335,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2014,246867,-0.005229780249891094
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.            ",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8762268,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,653934,0.0006507800079313289
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8652462,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2014,332955,0.02287966113538247
"Scalable Biomedical Pattern Recognition Via Deep Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patterns extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and other biomedical datasets can provide valuable feedback to a learning healthcare system, but our ability to find them is limited by certain manual steps. The dominant approach to finding the patterns uses supervised learning, where a computational algorithm searches for patterns among input variables (or features) that model an outcome variable (or label). This usually requires an expert to specify the learning task, construct input features, and prepare the outcome labels. This workflow has served us well for decades, but the dependence on human effort prevents it from scaling and it misses the most informative patterns, which are almost by definition the ones that nobody anticipates. It is poorly suited to the emerging era of population-scale data, in which we can conceive of massive new undertakings such as surveiling for all emerging diseases, detecting all unanticipated medication effects, or inferring the complete clinical phenotype of all genetic variants.      The approach of unsupervised feature learning overcomes these limitations by identifying meaningful patterns in massive, unlabeled datasets with little or no human involvement. While there is a large literature on feature creation, a new surge of interest in unsupervised methods is being driven by the recent development of deep learning, in which a compact hierarchy of expressive features is learned from large unlabeled datasets. In the domains of image and speech recognition, deep learning has produced features that meet or exceed (by as much as 70%) the previous state of the art on difficult standardized tasks.      Unfortunately, the noisy, sparse, and irregular data typically found in an EMR is a poor substrate for deep learning. Our approach uses Gaussian process regression to convert such an irregular sequence of observations into a longitudinal probability density that is suitable for use with a deep architecture. With this approach, we can learn continuous unsupervised features that capture the longitudinal structure of sparse and irregular observations. In our preliminary results unsupervised features were as powerful (0.96 AUC) in an unanticipated classification task as gold-standard features engineered by an expert with full knowledge of the domain, the classification task, and the class labels.      In this project we will learn unsupervised features for records of all individuals in our deidentifed EMR image, for each of 100 laboratory tests and 200 medications of relevance to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We will evaluate the features using three pattern recognition tasks that were unknown to the feature-learning algorithm: 1) an easy supervised classification task of distinguishing diabetics vs. nondiabetics, 2) a much more difficult task of distinguishing type 1 vs. type 2 diabetics, and 3) a genetic association task that considers the features as micro-phenotypes and measures their association with 29 different single nucleotide polymorphisms with known associations to type 1 or type 2 diabetes.             Every piece of data generated in the course of medical care can provide crucial feedback to a learning healthcare system, but only if relevant patterns can be found among them.

"Scalable Biomedical Pattern Recognition Via Deep Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patterns extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and other biomedical datasets can provide valuable feedback to a learning healthcare system, but our ability to find them is limited by certain manual steps. The dominant approach to finding the patterns uses supervised learning, where a computational algorithm searches for patterns among input variables (or features) that model an outcome variable (or label). This usually requires an expert to specify the learning task, construct input features, and prepare the outcome labels. This workflow has served us well for decades, but the dependence on human effort prevents it from scaling and it misses the most informative patterns, which are almost by definition the ones that nobody anticipates. It is poorly suited to the emerging era of population-scale data, in which we can conceive of massive new undertakings such as surveiling for all emerging diseases, detecting all unanticipated medication effects, or inferring the complete clinical phenotype of all genetic variants.  The approach of unsupervised feature learning overcomes these limitations by identifying meaningful patterns in massive, unlabeled datasets with little or no human involvement. While there is a large literature on feature creation, a new surge of interest in unsupervised methods is  being driven by the recent development of deep learning, in which a compact hierarchy of expressive features is learned from large unlabeled datasets. In the domains of image and speech recognition, deep learning has produced features that meet or exceed (by as much as 70%) the previous state of the art on difficult standardized tasks.  Unfortunately, the noisy, sparse, and irregular data typically found in an EMR is a poor substrate for deep learning. Our approach uses Gaussian process regression to convert such an irregular sequence of observations into a longitudinal probability density that is suitable for use with a deep architecture. With this approach, we can learn continuous unsupervised features that capture the longitudinal structure of sparse and irregular observations. In our preliminary results unsupervised features were as powerful (0.96 AUC) in an unanticipated classification task as gold-standard features engineered by an expert with full knowledge of the domain, the classification task, and the class labels.  In this project we will learn unsupervised features for records of all individuals in our deidentifed EMR image, for each of 100 laboratory tests and 200 medications of relevance to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We will evaluate the features using three pattern recognition tasks that were unknown to the feature-learning algorithm: 1) an easy supervised classification task of distinguishing diabetics vs. nondiabetics, 2) a much more difficult task of distinguishing type 1 vs. type 2 diabetics, and 3) a genetic association task that considers the features as micro-phenotypes and measures their association with 29 different single nucleotide polymorphisms with known associations to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Every piece of data generated in the course of medical care can provide crucial feedback to a learning healthcare system, but only if relevant patterns can be found among them.

"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids. The PI's team has performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the methods' near term applications will impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the methods will improve the autonomy of small robots and portable robotic devices that have a myriad of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the Pi's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The co-robotic navigation aid and the related technology address a growing public health care issue -- visual impairment and target improving the life quality of the blind.

"Sign Finding and Reading SFAR on GPU Accelerated Mobile Devices     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inability to access information on printed signs directly impacts the mobility independence of the over 1.2 million blind persons in the U.S. Many previously proposed technological solutions to this problem either required physical modifications to the environment (talking signs or the placement of coded markers) or required the user to carry around specialized computational equipment, which can be stigmatizing. A recently pursued strategy is to utilize the computational capabilities of smart phones and techniques from computer vision to allow blind persons to read signs at a distance using commercially available, non-stigmatizing, smart- phones. However, despite the fact that sophisticated algorithms exist to recognize and extract sign text from cluttered video input (as evidenced, for example, by mapping services such as Google Maps automatically locating and blurring out only license plate text in street-view maps) current mobile solutions for reading sign text at a distance perform relatively poorly. This poor performance is largely because until recently, smart-phone processors have simply not been able to execute state-of-the-art computer vision text extraction and recognition algorithms at real-time rates, which forced previous mobile sign readers to utilize older, simplistic, less effective algorithms. Next-generation smart-phones run on fundamentally different, hybrid processor architectures (such as the Tegra 4, Snapdragon 800, both released in 2013) with dedicated embedded graphical processing units (GPUs) and multi-core CPUs, which make them ideal for high-performance, vision-heavy computation. In this study, we propose to develop a smart-phone-based system for finding and reading signs at a distance which significantly outperforms previous such readers by implementing state-of-the-art text extraction algorithms on modern smart-phone hybrid GPU/CPU processor architectures. In Phase I, the proposed system will be developed and tested with blind users. In Phase II, feedback from user testing will be integrated into system design and the performance will be improved to permit operation in extremely challenging (such as low light) environments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 1.2 million people in the US are blind, and lack of safe and independent mobility substantially impacts the quality of life of this population. Printed textual signs, which are ubiquitously used in sighted navigation, are inaccessible to visually impaired persons, and this lack of access to environmental information contributes significantly to the mobility problem. This research would help develop a system whereby blind persons could use commercially available smart-phones to locate and read sign text at a distance.            ",Sign Finding and Reading SFAR on GPU Accelerated Mobile Devices,8779810,R43EY024800,"['Acceleration', 'Access to Information', 'Algorithms', 'Antirrhinum', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Hybrids', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Modification', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Running', 'SKI gene', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'assistive device/technology', 'authority', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'next generation', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'public health relevance', 'volunteer']",NEI,"LYNNTECH, INC.",R43,2014,229742,-0.024081829392915827
"BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ideally, as neuroscientists collect terabytes of image stacks, the data are automatically processed for open access and analysis. Yet, while several labs around the world are collecting data at unprecedented rates- up to terabytes per day-the computational technologies that facilitate streaming data-intensive computing remain absent. Also deploying data-intensive compute clusters is beyond the means and abilities of most experimental labs. This project will extend, develop, and deploy such technologies. To demonstrate these tools, we will utilize them in support of the ongoing mouse brain architecture (MBA) project, which already has amassed over 0.5 petabytes (PBs) of image data. The main computational challenges posed by these datasets are ones of scale. The tasks that follow remain relatively stereotyped across acquisition modalities. Until now, labs collecting data on this scale have been almost entirely isolated, left to ""reinvent the wheel"" for each of these problems. Moreover, the extant solutions are insufficient for a number of reasons: they often include numerous excel spreadsheets that rely on manual data entry, they lack scalable scientific database backends, and they run on ad hoc clusters not specifically designed for the computational tasks at hand. We aim to augment the current state of the art by implementing the following technological advancements into the MBA project pipeline: (1) Data Management will consist of a unified system that automatically captures metadata, launches processing pipelines, and provides quality control feedback in minutes instead of hours. (2) Data Processing tasks will run algorithms ""out-of-core"", appropriate for their computational requirements, including registration, alignment, and semantic segmentation of cell bodies and processes. (3) Data Storage will automatically build databases for storing multimodal image data and extracted annotations learned from the machine vision algorithms. These databases will be spatially co-registered and stored on an optimized heterogeneous compute cluster. (4) Data Access will be automatically available to everyone-including all the image data and data derived products-via Web-services, including 3D viewing, downloading, and further processing. (5) Data Analytics will extend random graph models suitable for multiscale circuit graphs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Nervous system disorders are responsible for approximately 30% of the total burden of illness in the United States. Whole brain neuroanatomy-available from massive neuroscientific image stacks-is widely believed to be a key missing link in our ability to prevent and treat such illnesses. Thus, this project aims to close this gap via the development and application of BIGDATA tools for management, storage, access, and analytics.              n/a",BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci,8631080,R01DA036400,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Cell physiology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Feedback', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Stereotyping', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States', 'Vision', 'burden of illness', 'cluster computing', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized data processing', 'data management', 'design', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal cell body', 'prevent', 'tool', 'web services']",NIDA,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2014,250003,0.02425970712308547

"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays.  This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment.  No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents.  Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image.  For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast.  These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view.  Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users.  Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures.  The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.  The proposed research would result in a smartphone/tablet-based assistive technology system (available for free) to provide increased access to such display information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users,8712492,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Location', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'information display', 'interest', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2014,368560,0.00823578164455481
"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.            ",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,8761698,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2014,314327,0.047485343480496066
"Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral venous access is pivotal to a wide range of clinical interventions and is consequently the leading cause of medical injury in the U.S. Complications associated with the procedure are exacerbated in difficult settings, where the rate of success depends heavily on the patient's physiology and the practitioner's experience. My dissertation thesis pertains to the development of imaging and robotic technologies to improve the accuracy and speed of blood draws and IV's. The core technology is an image-guided robotic device that accurately and autonomously introduces a cannula for venous access. The device operates by mapping in real-time the 3D structure of peripheral veins in order to robotically direct a needle into a selected vein. A working prototype has been developed and validated in several studies, the results of which are described in two journal publications. The device combines a 3D near-infrared vein imager, a robot, and computer vision software; these three components form the basis of the three Specific Aims described in this proposal. The Aims fit into the overall dissertation by 1) incorporating the current imaging hardware into a standalone, handheld imaging device; 2) introducing software for the imaging device that assists in selecting suitable cannulation sites; and 3) integrating the imaging device and software with a miniaturized version of the current robot. The outcome of this work will be a compact and low-cost system that is suited for beta-stage development.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood draws and IV therapies are one of the most commonly performed medical routines in hospitals and clinics. Injuries to doctors and patients happen frequently because of how difficult it can be to find veins and accurately insert the needle. We are developing a portable and lightweight medical robot to perform the procedure in situations where the doctor is unable to successfully access the veins. This device may greatly improve the safety and accuracy of venous access, and has wide applications in many clinical areas.            ","Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea",8718641,F31EB018191,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood', 'Cannulas', 'Cannulations', 'Catheters', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Emergency Care', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Motivation', 'Needles', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Sprague-Dawley Rats', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'robotic device', 'skeletal', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F31,2014,34424,-0.009909357958499244
"In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound examination performed to identify intra-peritoneal hemorrhage or pericardial tamponade. FAST involves the detection of free fluid in ultrasound images from four specific abdominal areas. Unstable patients with positive FAST results are operated on, and stable patients with negative results tend to be observed.  We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life-saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an intuitive application. Using that system, a novice operator will be visually guided to acquire ultrasound images from the abdominal locations and quantify the free fluid in those images.  The target for our initial deployment of the system is level 3 and 4 trauma centers. These centers must often serve areas spanning hundreds and even thousands of miles; however, they are typically under-staffed and under-equipped.  The proposal is being clinically driven by Jeffrey Lowell, MD. He is a USNR Trauma Surgeon, and he was recently deployed to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the only Level I Trauma Center outside the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound-based examination for rapidly detecting blood in the abdomen, particularly after blunt abdominal trauma, which is common, for example, with car accidents. The challenge is that the FAST procedure requires expertise and equipment which is not commonly available at level 3 and 4 trauma centers that serve rural populations. We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life- saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost, hand-held ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an easy-to-follow software application.            ",In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation,8652454,R43EB016621,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Injuries', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Blood', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Funding', 'Hand', 'Hemoperitoneum', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Operating Rooms', 'Organ Harvestings', 'Organ Procurements', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pelvis', 'Pericardial body location', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncompensated Care', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'health disparity', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'trauma centers']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R43,2014,195709,0.018779222915913673
"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy.

"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional     DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1.4 million women per year depend on pathologists to accurately interpret breast biopsies for a diagnosis of benign disease or cancer. Diagnostic errors are alarmingly frequent and likely lead to altered patient treatment, especially at the thresholds of atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, where up to 50% of cases are misclassified. The causes underlying these errors remain largely unknown.  Technology similar to Google Maps now allows pan and zoom manipulation of high-resolution digital images of glass microscope slides. This technology has virtually replaced the microscope in medical schools and is rapidly diffusing into U.S. pathology practices. No research has evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' interpretion of digital images vs. glass slides. However, these ""digital slides"" offer a novel opportunity to study the accuracy, efficiency, and viewing behavior of a large number of pathologists as they manipulate and interpret images. The innovative analytic techniques proposed in this application are similar to those used to improve the performance of pilots and air traffic controllers. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Digital Image vs. Glass Slides: To compare the interpretive accuracy of pathologists viewing digitized slide images over the Internet to their performance viewing original glass slides under a microscope. A randomized national sample of pathologists (N=200) will interpret 240 test cases in one or both formats in two phases. Measures will include a diagnostic assessment for each test case and for digital slides, cursor- (i.e., mouse) tracking data and region of interest (ROI) markings. Completion of this aim will establish benchmarks for the comparative diagnostic accuracy of whole-slide digital images.  Aim 2. Interpretive Screening Behavior: To identify visual scanning patterns associated with diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Detailed simultaneous eye-tracking and cursor-tracking data will be collected on 60 additional pathologists while they interpret digital slides to complement data from Aim 1. Viewing patterns will be analyzed from computer representations of raw movement data. Videos depicting accurate, efficient visual scanning and cursor movement will be valuable tools in educating the next generation of digital pathologists. Aim 3. Image Analyses: To examine and classify the image characteristics (including color, texture, and structure) of ROIs captured in Aims 1 and 2. Computer-based statistical learning techniques will be used to identify image characteristics that lead to correct and incorrect diagnoses. Characteristics of both diagnostic and distracting ROIs will be identified, linking all three aims. In summary, we will determine whether digitized whole-slide images are diagnostically equivalent to original glass slides. Our in-depth scientific evaluation of viewing patterns and characteristics of ROIs identified by pathologists will be critical to understanding diagnostic errors and sources of distraction. Optimization of viewing techniques will improve diagnostic performance and thus, the quality of clinical care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pathologist errors in the interpretation of biopsy specimens can result in significant harm to patients. Digital imaging technology is rapidly diffusing into medical settings, providing a unique opportunity to obtain data on the process used by pathologists when interpreting slides. The results will provide the foundation needed to improve interpretive accuracy and efficiency, support quality improvement efforts, and ultimately reduce the burden of misdiagnosis on patients and the health care delivery system.            ",Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization,8601692,R01CA172343,"['Adoption', 'Air', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Atypical hyperplasia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Rural Hospitals', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Evaluation', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative', 'computer monitor', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'distraction', 'eye hand coordination', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'migration', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,623127,-0.0021894730552987937
"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography  Project Summary/Abstract  Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quan- titative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational im- age analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentiallly between rest and stress - that will identify my- ocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work will involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to hu- mans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.            ",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,8614454,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Frequencies', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Radio', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,819740,0.014439006440354823
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,8761531,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Build-it', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,611476,0.030890820008482745
"Multimodal image registration by proxy image synthesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Image registration is a fundamentally important capability in modern neuroscience and clinical medicine. Normalization in functional imaging studies, studies of shape changes in growth, aging, and disease, overlaying surgical plans on intraoperative images, and geometric distortion correction are examples of important applications of image registration. There are dozens of needs for registration in both intrasubject and intersubject applications as well. Therefore, any improvement in image registration performance will have an immediate impact on the scientific and clinical communities. Despite numerous advances in image reconstruction algorithms, the use of multiple modalities (or tissue contrasts) to carry out image registration is a virtually untapped area. The vastly dominant framework is to register a single image of the subject to another single image of the target, and if multiple images are available of either subject or target, they are registered by using the transformation derived from the single image registration. The proposed research will develop, evaluate, and validate a very simply explained but quite radical idea for multi-modal registration. The basic idea is to synthesize a ""proxy"" image from the subject image that has the same tissue contrast and intensity range as the target image and then use a conventional metric such as sum-of-square difference to carry out the registration between the subject proxy and target. Preliminary results demonstrate significant benefits in this approach. In the grant we will: 1) Optimize ""proxy"" multimodal image registration by exploring its theoretical justification as well a key parameters of the overall approach; 2) Apply ""proxy"" multimodal image registration to three key applications in neuroscience in order to validate the method and develop principles of best practice; and 3) Write open source software to carry out image synthesis, similarity computation, and rigid and deformable registration using the ""proxy"" image concept. Both the software to synthesize images for use in a user's favorite image registration method as well as software to carry out the entire ""proxy"" registration process in an optimized way will be made publicly available as open source computer code. The results of this research will lead to a new era in image registration by changing the way researchers and practitioners acquire and use data for neuroscientific studies and clinical medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical image registration is a method used throughout clinical medicine and medical research and it is vital to the success of many treatments and therapies and for answering a myriad of important scientific questions. This research will permit better alignment by devising and testing a new similarity criterion for multimodal images using the first significantly new approach in over a decade. The result will be better alignment of these images, which will enable better clinical diagnosis and prognosis and more significant research discoveries.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. !         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.             ",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8414506,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2013,59383,0.0003441810706845517
"Intelligent and Automatic Image Segmentation Software for High ThroughputAnalysi     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well established that aging and many chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart failure, are associated with significant losses in skeletal muscle mass and strength in humans. There is agreement across the muscle biology community that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health and function of the muscle. However, at this time, quantification of muscle characteristics from standard histological and immunohistological techniques is still a manual or, at best, a semi-automatic process. This process is labor intensive and can be prone to errors, leading to high inter-observer variability. On the other hand, when muscle characteristics are calculated by computer-aided image analysis, data acquisition times decrease and objectivity improves significantly. The objective of this Phase I STTR project is to build a fully automatic, intelligent, and high throughput image acquisition and analysis software for quantitative muscle morphological analysis on digitized muscle cross-sections. We propose to utilize the most recent technical advances in machine learning and biomedical image analysis. This includes a newly developed deformable model and mean-shift based seed detection algorithm for better segmentation accuracy; an asymmetric online boosting based machine learning algorithm which allows the software to learn from errors and adjust its segmentation strategies adaptively; and a data parallelization schema using the graphic processing unit (GPU) to handle the computational bottleneck for extremely large scale image, such as whole slide scanned specimens. We believe that this software, equipped with the most advanced technical innovations, will be commercially attractive for the skeletal muscle research community including basic scientists, clinician scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry. The specific aim are: 1) Develop, implement, and validate an automatic biological image analysis software package for skeletal muscle tissue; 2) Develop a novel online updated intelligent artificial intelligence unit to enable the software to learn from errors; 3) Build a novel high performance computing unit to enable fast and high throughput automatic image analysis, which is capable of processing whole slide scanned muscle specimens. The analysis approach proposed will provide more consistent, accurate, and objective quantification of skeletal muscle morphological properties and the time for data analysis will be reduced by over a factor of 100 for standalone version and 2000 for parallel version. The long-term goal of Cytoinformatics, LLC for the Phase II stage is to apply the software to analyze histology/pathology from human muscle biopsy samples and extension of the software to other biological tissues, such as adipose tissue.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Important features of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health of the muscle.

"Automated retinopathy of prematurity classification using machine learning  Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop a web-based, semi-automated system for identifying severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with ""plus disease,"" using an existing data set of retinal images collected from previous NIH- funded research studies. ROP is treatable if diagnosed early, yet continues to be a leading cause of childhood blindness throughout the world. Diagnosis and documentation of ophthalmoscopic findings in ROP are subjective and qualitative, and studies have found that there is often significant diagnostic variation, even when experts are shown the exact same clinical data. Computer-based image analysis and the application of machine learning techniques to feature extraction and image classification have potential to address many of these limitations. Recent advances in image processing have had led to sophisticated techniques for tracing vessel-like structures. Additionally, machine-learning techniques will enable us to leverage these existing annotated image databases to improve the performance of our algorithms for vessel segmentation and disease classification. Our overall hypothesis is that retinal vascular features may be quantified and used to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of ROP. These hypotheses will be tested using two Specific Aims: (1) Develop and evaluate semi-automated algorithms to segment retinal vessels and generate a set of retinal vessel-based features. (2) Develop computer-based decision support algorithms that best correlate with expert opinions. Overall, this project will build upon infrastructure developed from previous studies, create potential for improving the accuracy and consistency of clinical ROP diagnosis, provide a demonstration of computer-based decision support from image analysis during real-world medical care, and stimulate future research toward understanding the vascular features associated with severe ROP. This project will be performed by a multi- disciplinary team of investigators with expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, machine learning, and image processing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the United States and throughout the world, and current diagnostic and documentation methods are often subjective and qualitative. We propose to use existing data sets to develop a web- based, semi-automated system for identifying severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with ""plus disease"" from retinal images. This has potential to improve the accuracy and consistency of ROP diagnosis, provide a demonstration of computer-based decision support from image analysis during real-world medical care, and stimulate future research toward understanding the vascular features associated with severe ROP.                 ",Automated retinopathy of prematurity classification using machine learning,8445584,R21EY022387,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Premature Infant', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'two-dimensional']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2013,283543,0.010265835479395545
"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project, we present aiArt: Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine applications. aiArt (pronounced eye-art), with its automated image analysis tools and user-friendly telemedicine web-interface, will enable exponential expansion of diabetic retinopathy screenings, thus fulfilling a significant health need as the number of people with diabetes climbs over the years. Latino population is genetically more prone to diabetes. Factors such as lack of awareness, lack of insurance coverage, and lack of access to expert clinicians greatly increase this disparity population's vulnerability to blindness due to DR. The situation is particularly grim in Los Angeles County, where there is a backlog of several thousand patients waiting to see an ophthalmologist, causing very long appointment wait times (often over six months). To help reduce risk of vision loss in this population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritization of ophthalmologist appointments, and to provide patient education tools. Our automated image analysis algorithms represent cutting-edge of research in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. The analysis engine will be closely integrated with simple, easy-to-use web-based telemedicine infrastructure provided by an existing, popular, telemedicine initiative, EyePACS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative The proposed image analysis tools will greatly reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy screening, and with its web and mobile phone accessible interface will drive an expansion of diabetic retinopathy screening, making it accessible to disparity populations (such as Latinos) which are not currently being screened due to socio-economic factors. The proposed tools will also enable quick turnaround time for screening, thus further helping prevent blindness due to diabetes complications.            ",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications,8466969,R43EB013585,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Awareness', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'County', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Dictionary', 'Disadvantaged', 'Economic Factors', 'Ensure', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Latino', 'Lesion', 'Localized Lesion', 'Location', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Microaneurysm', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometry', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Computing', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cotton wool spots', 'diabetes risk', 'experience', 'image processing', 'neovascularization', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIBIB,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2013,1,0.028319163580720633
"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms. Microscopy screens of cultured cells are routine, but researchers wish to study complex processes like metabolism and infection in a whole animal like the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which existing image analysis methods are insufficient. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to automatically identify and measure C. elegans in microscopy images, thereby making it possible for researchers worldwide to screen a wide variety of complex biological processes related to human disease.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8508596,K99LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,K99,2013,87300,-0.005229780249891094
"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex. We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning. To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support: First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management. Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices. Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements. These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology. Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,8479372,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2013,474880,0.05040479503184072
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8461069,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,425454,0.011788046945510186
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8477880,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2013,339750,0.02287966113538247
"Scalable Biomedical Pattern Recognition Via Deep Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patterns extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and other biomedical datasets can provide valuable feedback to a learning healthcare system, but our ability to find them is limited by certain manual steps. The dominant approach to finding the patterns uses supervised learning, where a computational algorithm searches for patterns among input variables (or features) that model an outcome variable (or label). This usually requires an expert to specify the learning task, construct input features, and prepare the outcome labels. This workflow has served us well for decades, but the dependence on human effort prevents it from scaling and it misses the most informative patterns, which are almost by definition the ones that nobody anticipates. It is poorly suited to the emerging era of population-scale data, in which we can conceive of massive new undertakings such as surveiling for all emerging diseases, detecting all unanticipated medication effects, or inferring the complete clinical phenotype of all genetic variants.      The approach of unsupervised feature learning overcomes these limitations by identifying meaningful patterns in massive, unlabeled datasets with little or no human involvement. While there is a large literature on feature creation, a new surge of interest in unsupervised methods is being driven by the recent development of deep learning, in which a compact hierarchy of expressive features is learned from large unlabeled datasets. In the domains of image and speech recognition, deep learning has produced features that meet or exceed (by as much as 70%) the previous state of the art on difficult standardized tasks.      Unfortunately, the noisy, sparse, and irregular data typically found in an EMR is a poor substrate for deep learning. Our approach uses Gaussian process regression to convert such an irregular sequence of observations into a longitudinal probability density that is suitable for use with a deep architecture. With this approach, we can learn continuous unsupervised features that capture the longitudinal structure of sparse and irregular observations. In our preliminary results unsupervised features were as powerful (0.96 AUC) in an unanticipated classification task as gold-standard features engineered by an expert with full knowledge of the domain, the classification task, and the class labels.      In this project we will learn unsupervised features for records of all individuals in our deidentifed EMR image, for each of 100 laboratory tests and 200 medications of relevance to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We will evaluate the features using three pattern recognition tasks that were unknown to the feature-learning algorithm: 1) an easy supervised classification task of distinguishing diabetics vs. nondiabetics, 2) a much more difficult task of distinguishing type 1 vs. type 2 diabetics, and 3) a genetic association task that considers the features as micro-phenotypes and measures their association with 29 different single nucleotide polymorphisms with known associations to type 1 or type 2 diabetes.             Every piece of data generated in the course of medical care can provide crucial feedback to a learning healthcare system, but only if relevant patterns can be found among them. The current practice of using human experts to guide the pattern search has served us well for decades, but it is poorly suited to the emerging era of population- scale data, in which we may conceive of massive new undertakings such as detecting all emerging diseases or all unanticipated medication effects. This project will develop methods to mathematically identify such patterns at a large scale, with no need for human judgment to specify what patterns to look for or where to look for them.",Scalable Biomedical Pattern Recognition Via Deep Learning,8566062,R21LM011664,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Uncertainty', 'Uric Acid', 'Work', 'cell growth', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'density', 'diabetic', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neoplastic cell', 'non-diabetic', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'type I and type II diabetes']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,175500,-0.02466914038521977
"Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The subcellular distribution of synapses is critical for the assembly, function, and plasticity of the nervous system and plays a role in its disorders. Underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain largely unknown. While advanced multidimensional images, in conjunction with single-cell genetic techniques, have afforded an unprecedented opportunity to understand synapse development at a new level, there is a knowledge gap in our capacity to effectively quantify subcellular synapses from large quantities of three-dimensional images. This is a significant problem and has hampered large-scale studies of the molecular mechanisms of synapse development, especially in neurons with complex arbor-such as Purkinje cells in mammals and lobula plate tangential cells (LPTC) in Drosophila-where existing approaches do not yield complete or robust synapse quantification for the entire dendritic tree and do not scale to efficient genetic screening. The objective of thi project is to bridge this gap by providing tools for quantitative investigation of subcellular synapse distribution and its molecular mechanisms using three-dimensional microscopy images. Specifically, our highly cross- disciplinary team will pursue two aims: (1) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Holistic and objective description of synapse density will enable automatic detection of mutant patterns. (2) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in different parts of the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Efficient quantification at distinct subcellular locations will assist discovery of novel regulators for different subcellular parts. As a test case, we will use synapse distribution n Drosophila LPTC neurons, which are amenable to both genome-wide genetic screens and genetic manipulations with single-neuron resolution. We will develop reliable methods to characterize the density of inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory cholinergic synapses from three-dimensional fluorescence confocal images. Our algorithms will lead to the next level of mechanistic understanding that controls the subcellular distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and enable a wide range of quantitative analyses for other types of neurons with similar complexity. Powerful multichannel co-analysis and machine learning approaches will be used to improve synapse detection and subcellular compartment extraction for overcoming challenges in 3D confocal image, including staining artifacts and anisotropic resolution. Algorithms will be developed using a model-guided methodology that emphasizes efficiency for large volume 3D images during genetic screening. Pattern-recognition methods will be used to speed up proofreading of the synapse quantification results. A novel ordering strategy will be adapted for neurons of complex dendritic arbor to quantify subcellular synapses in a functionally meaningful way. The project will produce a set of open-source, extensible tools for automatic synapse quantification and proofreading, with friendly graphical-user interfaces, to serve the neuroscience community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying molecular mechanisms for the subcellular distribution of synapses remain largely unknown, which hinders the discovery of novel therapies for many neurological disorders. By developing new, efficient automatic algorithms and open-source tools for quantifying synapses in neurons, this research intends to advance the capacity to effectively analyze large quantities of three-dimensional neuronal images, especially those of complex dendritic arbor. The work will impact public health by enabling a better understanding of disease mechanisms, which is the critical first step toward new treatments, and supports NIH's goal to advance understanding of fundamental biology to uncover the causes of specific diseases.            ",Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor,8574710,R15MH099569,"['Academic Research Enhancement Awards', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic synapse', 'density', 'falls', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,R15,2013,461165,-0.03461691684555024
"Mobile Search for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The technology developed as part of this NIH SBIR project will transform the cell phone camera of visually impaired individuals into a powerful tool capable of identifying the objects they encounter, track the items they own, or navigate complex new environments. Broad access to low-cost visual intelligence technologies developed in this project will improve the independence and capabilities of the visually impaired. There has been tremendous technological progress in computer vision and in the computational power and network bandwidth of and Smartphone platforms. The synergy of these advances stands to revolutionize the way people find information and interact with the physical world. However, these technologies are not yet fully in the hands of the visually impaired, arguably the population that could benefit the most from these developments. Part of the barrier to progress in this area has been that computer vision can accurately handle only a small fraction of the typical images coming from a cell phone camera. To cope with these limitations and make any-image recognition possible, IQ Engines will develop a hybrid system that uses both computer vision and crowdsourcing: if the computer algorithms are not able to understand an image, then the image is sent to a unique crowdsourcing network of people for image analysis. The proposed research includes specific aims to both develop advanced computer vision algorithms for object recognition and advanced crowdsourced networks optimized to the needs of the visually impaired community. This approach combines the speed and accuracy of computer vision with the robustness and understanding of human vision, ultimately providing the user fast and accurate information about the content of any image.           The image recognition technology developed in this application will enable the visually impaired to access visual information using a mobile phone camera, a device most people already have.

"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids. The PI's team has performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the methods' near term applications will impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the methods will improve the autonomy of small robots and portable robotic devices that have a myriad of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the Pi's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The co-robotic navigation aid and the related technology address a growing public health care issue -- visual impairment and target improving the life quality of the blind. The research fits well into the Rehabilitation Engineering Program ofthe NIBIB that includes robotics rehabilitation.

"BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ideally, as neuroscientists collect terabytes of image stacks, the data are automatically processed for open access and analysis. Yet, while several labs around the world are collecting data at unprecedented rates- up to terabytes per day-the computational technologies that facilitate streaming data-intensive computing remain absent. Also deploying data-intensive compute clusters is beyond the means and abilities of most experimental labs. This project will extend, develop, and deploy such technologies. To demonstrate these tools, we will utilize them in support of the ongoing mouse brain architecture (MBA) project, which already has amassed over 0.5 petabytes (PBs) of image data. The main computational challenges posed by these datasets are ones of scale. The tasks that follow remain relatively stereotyped across acquisition modalities. Until now, labs collecting data on this scale have been almost entirely isolated, left to ""reinvent the wheel"" for each of these problems. Moreover, the extant solutions are insufficient for a number of reasons: they often include numerous excel spreadsheets that rely on manual data entry, they lack scalable scientific database backends, and they run on ad hoc clusters not specifically designed for the computational tasks at hand. We aim to augment the current state of the art by implementing the following technological advancements into the MBA project pipeline: (1) Data Management will consist of a unified system that automatically captures metadata, launches processing pipelines, and provides quality control feedback in minutes instead of hours. (2) Data Processing tasks will run algorithms ""out-of-core"", appropriate for their computational requirements, including registration, alignment, and semantic segmentation of cell bodies and processes. (3) Data Storage will automatically build databases for storing multimodal image data and extracted annotations learned from the machine vision algorithms. These databases will be spatially co-registered and stored on an optimized heterogeneous compute cluster. (4) Data Access will be automatically available to everyone-including all the image data and data derived products-via Web-services, including 3D viewing, downloading, and further processing. (5) Data Analytics will extend random graph models suitable for multiscale circuit graphs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Nervous system disorders are responsible for approximately 30% of the total burden of illness in the United States. Whole brain neuroanatomy-available from massive neuroscientific image stacks-is widely believed to be a key missing link in our ability to prevent and treat such illnesses. Thus, this project aims to close this gap via the development and application of BIGDATA tools for management, storage, access, and analytics.              n/a",BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci,8599834,R01DA036400,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Cell physiology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Feedback', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Stereotyping', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States', 'Vision', 'burden of illness', 'cluster computing', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized data processing', 'data management', 'design', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal cell body', 'prevent', 'tool', 'web services']",NIDA,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2013,249999,0.02425970712308547
"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays. This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image. For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast. These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view. Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users. Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures. The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.  The proposed research would result in a smartphone/tablet-based assistive technology system (available for free) to provide increased access to such display information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.                ",Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users,8579051,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Location', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'information display', 'interest', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2013,376082,0.007955322053236145
"In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound examination performed to identify intra-peritoneal hemorrhage or pericardial tamponade. FAST involves the detection of free fluid in ultrasound images from four specific abdominal areas. Unstable patients with positive FAST results are operated on, and stable patients with negative results tend to be observed.  We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life-saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an intuitive application. Using that system, a novice operator will be visually guided to acquire ultrasound images from the abdominal locations and quantify the free fluid in those images.  The target for our initial deployment of the system is level 3 and 4 trauma centers. These centers must often serve areas spanning hundreds and even thousands of miles; however, they are typically under-staffed and under-equipped.  The proposal is being clinically driven by Jeffrey Lowell, MD. He is a USNR Trauma Surgeon, and he was recently deployed to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the only Level I Trauma Center outside the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound-based examination for rapidly detecting blood in the abdomen, particularly after blunt abdominal trauma, which is common, for example, with car accidents. The challenge is that the FAST procedure requires expertise and equipment which is not commonly available at level 3 and 4 trauma centers that serve rural populations. We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life- saving FAST procedures.

"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We envision that a systematic characterization of microtubule dynamics and their response to taxanes will allow chemotherapy customization and prolong survival of castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient. The proposed study has the potential to impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians with a computer- aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized medical treatment. In addition, it will bring insight into the mechanisms of inherent and acquired resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs.            ",Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy,8526929,F32CA177104,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Event', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Microscope', 'Microtubule Polymerization', 'Microtubule Stabilization', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PC3 cell line', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Scheme', 'Second Primary Neoplasms', 'Taxane Compound', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubulin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'docetaxel', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'taxane', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F32,2013,53942,-0.018111015860781305
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional  Abstract Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.

"Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1.4 million women per year depend on pathologists to accurately interpret breast biopsies for a diagnosis of benign disease or cancer. Diagnostic errors are alarmingly frequent and likely lead to altered patient treatment, especially at the thresholds of atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, where up to 50% of cases are misclassified. The causes underlying these errors remain largely unknown.  Technology similar to Google Maps now allows pan and zoom manipulation of high-resolution digital images of glass microscope slides. This technology has virtually replaced the microscope in medical schools and is rapidly diffusing into U.S. pathology practices. No research has evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' interpretion of digital images vs. glass slides. However, these ""digital slides"" offer a novel opportunity to study the accuracy, efficiency, and viewing behavior of a large number of pathologists as they manipulate and interpret images. The innovative analytic techniques proposed in this application are similar to those used to improve the performance of pilots and air traffic controllers. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Digital Image vs. Glass Slides: To compare the interpretive accuracy of pathologists viewing digitized slide images over the Internet to their performance viewing original glass slides under a microscope. A randomized national sample of pathologists (N=200) will interpret 240 test cases in one or both formats in two phases. Measures will include a diagnostic assessment for each test case and for digital slides, cursor- (i.e., mouse) tracking data and region of interest (ROI) markings. Completion of this aim will establish benchmarks for the comparative diagnostic accuracy of whole-slide digital images.  Aim 2. Interpretive Screening Behavior: To identify visual scanning patterns associated with diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Detailed simultaneous eye-tracking and cursor-tracking data will be collected on 60 additional pathologists while they interpret digital slides to complement data from Aim 1. Viewing patterns will be analyzed from computer representations of raw movement data. Videos depicting accurate, efficient visual scanning and cursor movement will be valuable tools in educating the next generation of digital pathologists. Aim 3. Image Analyses: To examine and classify the image characteristics (including color, texture, and structure) of ROIs captured in Aims 1 and 2. Computer-based statistical learning techniques will be used to identify image characteristics that lead to correct and incorrect diagnoses. Characteristics of both diagnostic and distracting ROIs will be identified, linking all three aims. In summary, we will determine whether digitized whole-slide images are diagnostically equivalent to original glass slides. Our in-depth scientific evaluation of viewing patterns and characteristics of ROIs identified by pathologists will be critical to understanding diagnostic errors and sources of distraction. Optimization of viewing techniques will improve diagnostic performance and thus, the quality of clinical care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pathologist errors in the interpretation of biopsy specimens can result in significant harm to patients. Digital imaging technology is rapidly diffusing into medical settings, providing a unique opportunity to obtain data on the process used by pathologists when interpreting slides. The results will provide the foundation needed to improve interpretive accuracy and efficiency, support quality improvement efforts, and ultimately reduce the burden of misdiagnosis on patients and the health care delivery system.            ",Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization,8420220,R01CA172343,"['Adoption', 'Air', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Atypical hyperplasia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Rural Hospitals', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Evaluation', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative', 'computer monitor', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'distraction', 'eye hand coordination', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'migration', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,682340,-0.0021894730552987937
"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.        The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina.

"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics. In this approach the entropy of the backscattered segment is used to produce a pixel value in the tissue image. This processing strategy has proven to be sensitive to weak, sub-resolution sized changes in tissue.            ",ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS,8636638,R21EB018095,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Base Composition', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expeditions', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Fractals', 'Frequencies', 'Heart', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Microscopic', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data reduction', 'design', 'detector', 'heart motion', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'n-dimensional', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'sound', 'tissue processing', 'vector']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,228000,-0.0008174228440309358

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project, we present aiArt: Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine applications. aiArt (pronounced eye-art), with its automated image analysis tools and user-friendly telemedicine web-interface, will enable exponential expansion of diabetic retinopathy screenings, thus fulfilling a significant health need as the number of people with diabetes climbs over the years. Latino population is genetically more prone to diabetes. Factors such as lack of awareness, lack of insurance coverage, and lack of access to expert clinicians greatly increase this disparity population's vulnerability to blindness due to DR. The situation is particularly grim in Los Angeles County, where there is a backlog of several thousand patients waiting to see an ophthalmologist, causing very long appointment wait times (often over six months). To help reduce risk of vision loss in this population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritization of ophthalmologist appointments, and to provide patient education tools. Our automated image analysis algorithms represent cutting-edge of research in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. The analysis engine will be closely integrated with simple, easy-to-use web-based telemedicine infrastructure provided by an existing, popular, telemedicine initiative, EyePACS.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative The proposed image analysis tools will greatly reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy screening, and with its web and mobile phone accessible interface will drive an expansion of diabetic retinopathy screening, making it accessible to disparity populations (such as Latinos) which are not currently being screened due to socio-economic factors.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          n/a",Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation,8323502,R00LM009889,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Distance Learning', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Retrieval', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer site', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information model', 'meetings', 'oncology', 'open source', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2012,234509,0.010468726492283888
"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms. Microscopy screens of cultured cells are routine, but researchers wish to study complex processes like metabolism and infection in a whole animal like the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which existing image analysis methods are insufficient. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to automatically identify and measure C. elegans in microscopy images, thereby making it possible for researchers worldwide to screen a wide variety of complex biological processes related to human disease.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:           Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,8274831,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2012,503268,0.051190204604618796
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"Mobile Search for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The technology developed as part of this NIH SBIR project will transform the cell phone camera of visually impaired individuals into a powerful tool capable of identifying the objects they encounter, track the items they own, or navigate complex new environments. Broad access to low-cost visual intelligence technologies developed in this project will improve the independence and capabilities of the visually impaired. There has been tremendous technological progress in computer vision and in the computational power and network bandwidth of and Smartphone platforms. The synergy of these advances stands to revolutionize the way people find information and interact with the physical world. However, these technologies are not yet fully in the hands of the visually impaired, arguably the population that could benefit the most from these developments. Part of the barrier to progress in this area has been that computer vision can accurately handle only a small fraction of the typical images coming from a cell phone camera. To cope with these limitations and make any-image recognition possible, IQ Engines will develop a hybrid system that uses both computer vision and crowdsourcing: if the computer algorithms are not able to understand an image, then the image is sent to a unique crowdsourcing network of people for image analysis. The proposed research includes specific aims to both develop advanced computer vision algorithms for object recognition and advanced crowdsourced networks optimized to the needs of the visually impaired community. This approach combines the speed and accuracy of computer vision with the robustness and understanding of human vision, ultimately providing the user fast and accurate information about the content of any image.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The image recognition technology developed in this application will enable the visually impaired to access visual information using a mobile phone camera, a device most people already have.

This project will develop specifications to extend FIVR¿s capabilities to standardize, store, and analyze more diverse food images, such as 3D photos; to collect other food data; to enhance the analysis tools; and for interfaces to a variety of clinical/research systems. The FIVR Version 2 functional prototype will be developed to use 3D dietary images as input. A final evaluation of the FIVR V2 prototype will be conducted to assess the accuracy and feasibility of the 3D image diet capture with a group of 9 subjects in a controlled feeding study. n/a","OTHER FUNCTIONS SBIR TOPIC 308, PHASE I: THE MOBILE FOOD INTAKE PHOTO STORAGE AN",8554263,61201200042C,"['Car Phone', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Phase', 'Reporting', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'feeding', 'innovative technologies', 'novel', 'prototype', 'speech recognition', 'tool']",NCI,"VIOCARE, INC.",N43,2012,200000,-0.029438327036514046
"Vision Without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera  Vision without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera Project Summary As computer vision object recognition algorithms improve in accuracy and speed, and computers become more powerful and compact, it is becoming increasingly practical to implement such algorithms on portable devices such as camera-enabled cell phones. This ""mobile vision"" approach allows normally sighted users to identify objects, signs, places and other features in the environment simply by snapping a photo and waiting a few seconds for the results of the object recognition analysis. The approach holds great promise for blind or visually impaired (VI) users, who may have no other means of identifying important features that are undetectable by non-visual cues. However, in order for the approach to be practical for VI users, the interaction between the user and the environment using the camera must be properly facilitated. For instance, since the user may not know in advance which direction to point the camera towards a desired target, he or she must be able to pan the camera left and right to search for it, and receive rapid feedback whenever it is detected. Drawing on past experience of the PI and his colaborators on object recognition systems for VI users, we propose to study the use of mobile vision technologies for exploring features in the environment, specificaly examining the process of discovering these features and obtaining guidance towards them. Our main objectives are to investigate the strategies adopted by users of these technologies to expedite the exploration process, devise and test maximally effective user interfaces consistent with these strategies, and to assess and benchmark the efficiency of the technologies. The result will be a set of minimum design standards that will specify the system performance parameters, the user interface functionality and the operational strategies necessary for any mobile vision object recognition system for VI users.  Vision without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera Project Narrative The ability to locate and identify objects, places and other features in the environment is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but this fundamental capability is missing or severely degraded in the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind. The proposed research would investigate how computer vision object recognition technologies, which are now being implemented on mobile vision devices such as cel phones but are typicaly designed for normaly sighted users, could be modified and harnessed to meet the special needs of blind and visually impaired persons. Such research could lead to new technologies to dramatically improve independence for this population",Vision Without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera,8334623,R21EY021643,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Goals', 'Goggles', 'Grant', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Location', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Research', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'blind', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'legally blind', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'usability', 'visual feedback']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2012,229834,-0.0235636903069235
"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,8234040,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer program', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard measure', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2012,424407,0.008760749440830764
"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.

"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases. Open source software written in a highly portable language will be made available to the research community at the conclusion of the research grant.           The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina.

"Exploring Clinically-relevant Image Retrieval for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis  Project Summary All people with diabetes have the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, a vision-threatening complication. Despite advances in diabetes care over the years, diabetic retinopathy remains a potentially devastating complication. Early detection and timely intervention or treatment can reduce the incidence of blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. Recent years, diagnosis based on digital retinal imaging has become an alternative to traditional face-to-face evaluation. The potential benefits of automated analysis of digital images of diabetic retinopathy have been shown in existing studies. However, no current computer-based systems can achieve the same level of performance of human experts. This proposal takes a new perspective in developing a computer-aided system for improved diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, by exploring novel computational methods for retrieving clinically-relevant images from archived database with prior diagnosis information, for a given novel image. Images are considered as being clinically relevant if they contain the same types of lesions with similar severity levels. Research and development on content-based retinal image search/retrieval is still in its infancy, with only limited success, largely due to the challenge of explicitly coding expert-knowledge into a computational algorithm. To deal with the challenge, this research project takes a distinctly different approach engaging a machine-learning approach, where a labeled image set is used to train a computer algorithm for analyzing other new images, with the focus of training on similarity in clinical relevance instead of image features. The training is enabled in part by the investigators' existing research on computer-based lesion simulation. One specific aim of the research is to build a content-based image retrieval system that can provide a clinician with instant reference to archival images that are clinically relevant to the image under diagnosis. This is an innovative way of exploiting vast expert knowledge hidden in libraries of previously-diagnosed digital images of diabetic retinopathy for a clinician's improved performance in diagnosis. Another specific aim is to build an image information management system for diabetic retinopathy that supports the deployment of the retrieval system in a realistic clinical setting. In addition to the retrieval system, the direct outcome of the research also includes automated evaluation algorithms for diabetic retinopathy images with potentially improved performance compared with existing methods. In particular, the design of the proposed work allows different configurations of the resultant system according to the specific needs of a physician.  Project Narrative This project develops a computer-based system for improved diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, a vision- threatening complication in people with diabetes. Early detection and timely intervention or treatment can reduce the incidence of blindness, and the computer-based system can potentially improve not only the speed but also the accuracy in diagnosing or screening patients with diabetic retinopathy.",Exploring Clinically-relevant Image Retrieval for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis,8300746,R21HS019792,[' '],AHRQ,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2012,151744,-0.010375213853838395
"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software for Mathematics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Fast-Track application focuses on developing the first artificial intelligence (AI) educational software to teach developmental mathematics to the blind and visually impaired. This project responds to the National Eye Institute's General Research Topics for ""teaching tools"" and the Visual Impairment and Blindness Program for ""other devices that meet the rehabilitative and everyday living needs of persons who are blind or have low vision."" The intervention being developed will place a comprehensive set of AI mathematics tutoring systems with integrated AI assessment capabilities in the hands of the blind K-12, college and adult student, for use on demand during study at home and at school. The formulation of an advanced AI tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to its design will have broad implications for development in many subject areas beyond mathematics. Project objectives include: Horizontal Expansion of Accessible Curriculum Content Coverage (Ratio and Proportion, Percentages, Linear Equations, Metric Units, Scientific Notation) 1) Conduct initial accessibility review and analysis of AI tutor's existing user interface. 2) Implement accessibility requirements and recommendations from NFB, instructors and other partners. 3) Conduct final review to gain NFB accessibility certification after implementation of requirements. 4) Develop and issue survey of instructors on mathematics pedagogy and technology. Vertical Expansion of Accessible Features and Technological Capability 5) Implement Braille support in AI technology. 6) Develop additional AI tutor on Fractions that is automatically accessible from first principles using accessible AI framework. Evaluation of Accessible AI Educational Technology 7) Field evaluation of accessible AI technology with blind students and their instructors. 8) Continued demonstration and review of accessible AI technology by partners and other stakeholders. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum already has long-term partnerships established with McGraw- Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as a major science education catalog company, CyberEd, Inc., a PLATO Learning Company.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          n/a",Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation,8299311,R00LM009889,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Distance Learning', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Retrieval', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer site', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information model', 'meetings', 'oncology', 'open source', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2011,239426,0.010468726492283888
"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:           Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,8102722,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2011,458901,0.051190204604618796
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8163481,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2011,459174,0.011788046945510186
"PATHOLOGY MISS RATE RISK REDUCTION IN DIAGNOSTIC SMALL BOWEL CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Well trained, experienced gastroenterologists in academic and high volume settings can reliably recognize 97% of pathologies in Capsule Endoscopy (CE) video. However, community physicians and infrequent users may miss up to 20%. The end goal of our proposed new line of research is to develop clinical software that provides automatic decision support to physicians who are trying to declare that a patient is pathology free or has a certain disease process. The risk for the physician - and their patients - is that of a less than optimal clinical outcome due to:  1) missing a lesion/pathology in the video and putting the patient at risk of developing a more serious condition over time, or  2) mistakenly ""identifying"" a pathology that is not present and thus subjecting the patient to unnecessary further diagnostic or surgical procedures.  The research aims in this proposal will enable Ikona to create a pathology prioritization image processing module. Implementing modern machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Adaboost methodologies together with proprietary image feature analysis, this technology will assign a probability metric to every frame in the image sequence for specific pathology (lesions, ulcers, bleeding, etc) and the major landmarks in the GI tract (ileo-cecal valve, pyloric valve etc.). Filtering and sorting endoscopy image data will be done such that the images with the highest probability of containing pathology will be presented to the reviewer first.  This pathology prioritized sequencing is not intended to replace the clinician in the workflow, but rather to allow the clinician to focus more time on frames with a higher potential of containing pathology. Often times, clinically significant pathology may only be present in a single frame. A single ""pathological"" frame in the middle of a 50,000 frame sequence can easily be overlooked by a novice reviewer or a reviewer whose attention is temporarily distracted. With our proposed pathology prioritization, that single pathological frame will be identified and sorted near the beginning of the image sequence thus greatly increasing the likelihood of detection by the reviewer.  Specifically for Phase I, we plan to investigate and develop different algorithms for classifying image frames and recognizing pathological and normal frames, and, algorithms for ranking frames by severity of pathology. Following the implementation of a working prototype, we will further test the clinical utility of these algorithms with human clinical capsule endoscopy videos.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is widely used for assessing the small intestine in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Experienced gastroenterologists miss 2-3% of pathologies in part due to fatigue from reviewing 50,000 frames per CE video. Less experienced reviewers miss up to 20%. We propose to reduce the risk of false negatives by developing clinical image processing software to automatically re-order the CE video frames, ranking them by the probability they contain pathology.           Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is widely used for assessing the small intestine in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.

"Digital image analysis for quantitative and qualitative assessment of pig islets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demonstration by the Edmonton group that human islet transplantation can be successfully used to manage adult type 1 diabetes patients with refractory hypoglycemia has led to increased funding of clinical trials and further research to extend the scope of this therapy by using porcine islets in place of human islets. Significant advances have been made in improving immunosuppression treatment regimens so that results obtained from treating adult diabetic patients with human islet transplants are similar to those obtained after pancreas transplantation. The major hurdle to move this therapy from clinical research to routine clinical practice is to improve the yield and quality of islets recovered from human or porcine pancreas. Presently, there are no standardized methods that can accurately assess the number or quality of islets that are used in the islet transplantation procedures so that results between laboratories can be objectively evaluated. This grant is focused on developing a robust, islet image analysis software to objectively analyze the number and quality of porcine islets recovered from the pancreas. The two major aims of the project are first to develop an improved image analysis software program that will provide a standardized measurement of the number and mass of porcine islets in a cell preparation. And second, enhance the capabilities of the software program by correlating the image signatures of each porcine islet to an artificial category. Porcine islets of similar size will be handpicked and sorted into three categories based on the shape, border, integrity, or uniformity of dithizone staining. The first software enhancement will find those features in the images that can be used to distinguish the different categories of islets. The second enhancement will assess the feasibility of using machine learning methods to correlate these features with data recovered from the images but also other discrete or continuous variables that are used to characterize the porcine islet preparations. If successful, the ability to use a rapid and objective image analysis methodology will improve the assessment of the number and quality of islets within and between laboratories; correlate image features with success of transplantation as measured by graft survival and insulin independence; and improve the islet isolation methods to achieve favorable islet image scores that are determined by retrospective analysis. The ability of a commercial firm focused on improving islet yields by focusing on tissue dissociation with a leading academic laboratory that has sophisticated expertise in developing software algorithms from microscopic images provides a fresh approach to a difficult medical that needs to be resolved to realize the full potential of islet transplantation to treat adult type 1 diabetic patients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An objective, reliable and accurate method for the assessment of islet quantity and quality is paramount to the standardization and subsequent success of islet transplantation as a treatment for type 1 diabetes. Conventional manual methods for determining islet yields using an optical microscope with a calibrated eyepiece reticule are subjective, time consuming and often overestimate islet mass due to sampling errors and erroneous assumptions in the conversion of islet numbers to islet equivalents. The research proposed will utilize recent advances in digital image analysis, including machine learning and pattern recognition, to develop a software algorithm for the rapid characterization of islets destined for transplantation procedures.           An objective, reliable and accurate method for the assessment of islet quantity and quality is paramount to the standardization and subsequent success of islet transplantation as a treatment for type 1 diabetes.

"Heterogeneous in situ data: Kernals, Distances and Trees    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to provide biologists with new tools to help them understand complex systems for which they have different sources of heterogeneous 'in situ' data. These data present many levels of heterogeneity and come concurrently with spatio-temporal and prior information that need to be incorporated into integrated data structures.  This collaboration starts with the design of the collection process and provides tools for data integration and analysis written around the statistics package R and an interactive image analysis program GEMEDENT written in JAVA.  The project concentrates on two specific types of heterogeneous data: metagenomic data and sequence mixtures provided by the new pyrosequencing machines and cell image data provided by automated microscopes.  The first type of heterogeneous data are microbial soil sample data collected by Alfred Spormann from Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford. The proposal focuses on applying Bayesian computations in the design of sample locations and number of sequences collected and then using spectral multivariate methods to analyze diversity indices as tables (instead of summaries), thus incorporating the data structure into the decompositions. These methods will also be useful in the study of mixture data from pyrosequencing HIV, bacteria, viruses and cancer cells.  The second study focuses on the interaction between immune cells and breast cancer in a collaboration with Peter Lee, hematologist at Stanford. We will analyze data from microscope images of stained lymph nodes. An integrated image analysis system enables the automatic detection of the location and size of many different cell types from stained images. Random forests have been incorporated into the image analysis system and an effective interactive boosting component provides the user with the possibility to iterate the learning process until a desired level of accuracy is attained. These data enable us to infer the spatial and dynamic interaction between the tumors and the immune cells. A postdoctoral fellow will be in charge of combining the cell data with the clinical history and the micro-array expression data from the same patient. The heterogeneity will be dealt with by using exploratory multivariate techniques based on spectral analysis, kernel methods and graphical representations.          n/a","Heterogeneous in situ data: Kernals, Distances and Trees",8100386,R01GM086884,"['Bacteria', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Environmental Engineering technology', 'HIV', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'In Situ', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Patients', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Virus', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'data integration', 'data structure', 'design', 'forest', 'indexing', 'lymph nodes', 'microbial', 'programs', 'soil sampling', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,220839,-0.02295577280670343
"Vision Without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As computer vision object recognition algorithms improve in accuracy and speed, and computers become more powerful and compact, it is becoming increasingly practical to implement such algorithms on portable devices such as camera-enabled cell phones. This ""mobile vision"" approach allows normally sighted users to identify objects, signs, places and other features in the environment simply by snapping a photo and waiting a few seconds for the results of the object recognition analysis. The approach holds great promise for blind or visually impaired (VI) users, who may have no other means of identifying important features that are undetectable by non-visual cues. However, in order for the approach to be practical for VI users, the interaction between the user and the environment using the camera must be properly facilitated. For instance, since the user may not know in advance which direction to point the camera towards a desired target, he or she must be able to pan the camera left and right to search for it, and receive rapid feedback whenever it is detected. Drawing on past experience of the PI and his collaborators on object recognition systems for VI users, we propose to study the use of mobile vision technologies for exploring features in the environment, specific examining the process of discovering these features and obtaining guidance towards them. Our main objectives are to investigate the strategies adopted by users of these technologies to expedite the exploration process, devise and test maximally effective user interfaces consistent with these strategies, and to assess and benchmark the efficiency of the technologies. The result will be a set of minimum design standards that will specify the system performance parameters, the user interface functionality and the operational strategies necessary for any mobile vision object recognition system for VI users.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to locate and identify objects, places and other features in the environment is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but this fundamental capability is missing or severely degraded in the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind.

"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,8037095,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer program', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard measure', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2011,417204,0.008760749440830764

The process currently requires a trained technician to identify populations on a digital graph of the data by manually drawing regions. As the complexity of the data increases, this gating task becomes more lengthy and laborious, and it is increasingly clear that minimizing human processing is essential to increasing both throughput and consistency. In clinical tests and diagnostic environments, automated gating would eliminate a complex set of human instructions and decisions in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), thereby reducing error and speeding results to the doctor. In many cases, the software will be able to recognize the need for additional tests before the doctor has an opportunity to look at the first report. Currently no software is available to perform complex multi-parameter analyses in an automated and rigorously validated manner. FlowDx will fill an important gap in the evolution of the technology and pave the way for ever larger phenotypic studies and for the translation of this research process to a clinical environment. Specific Aims 1) Fully define the experimental protocol, whereby a researcher can compare two or more classifications of identical data sets to study the differences, biases and effectiveness of human and algorithmic classifiers. 2) Describe and evaluate metrics that compare the performance of classification algorithms. 3) Conduct analytical experiments on our identified use cases, illustrating the potential of this technique to affect clinical analysis. 4) Iteratively implement the tools to automate these experiments, improve the experimental capabilities, and collaborate in new use cases. These aims will be satisfied while maintaining quantitative standards of software quality, establishing measurements in system uptime, throughput and robustness to set the baseline for subsequent iterations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FlowDx, a Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software Project is designed to create a new, more efficient, and more effective way of analyzing cells for the presence of cancer, HIV/ AIDS, and other diseases, using a fully automated software system. Using Magnetic Gating, Probability Clustering, Subtractive Cluster Analysis, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), Tree Star software will analyze the cell samples from patients at a much faster rate and with fewer false positives and negatives than the manual method now in use. The FlowDx Project 1) Fits the ""translational medicine"" model of the NIH Roadmap 2) Reduces error in the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases 3) Speeds results to physicians. Patients learn the outcome more quickly. Therapeutic intervention is faster. 4) Accommodates large-scale research by allowing greater volumes of complex data to be much more quickly examined, compared, and quantified 5) Reduces the expense of cell analysis by as much as 50% 6) Conforms to 21CFR Part 11 guidance           Narrative FlowDx, a Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software Project is designed to create a new, more efficient, and more effective way of analyzing cells for the presence of cancer, HIV/ AIDS, and other diseases, using a fully automated software system.

"A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer"", an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support ""human-in-the-loop"" interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.        Re: Project Title: Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision  FOA: PHS 2009-02 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH, CDC, FDA and ACF for Small Business  Innovation Research Grant Applications (Parent SBIR [R43/R44])  Proposed project period: April 1, 2010 - March 31, 2012  Principal Investigator: Hallinan, Peter W.

"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems. Discoveries and concrete advances made in this study will contribute to solutions for effective use of digital images-a problem that is central to research and application across science, technology, and medicine. Advancements in our understanding of the design of useful and usable information systems will benefit society at large and contribute to the public health.

"Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma diagnosis, management and research depend on complex judgments of the optic disc (or optic nerve head), visual field and intraocular pressure. The current standard of optic disc evaluation requires qualitative observer judgments of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc, a less than optimal method. Despite much research, no methods have yet conclusively improved over this conventional Approach: Contemporary optic disc analyzers typically use instrument-specific image capture methods and derive quantitative estimates for various anatomical features of the optic disc. Our goal is to improve the methods of optic disc diagnosis by applying advanced image analysis methods from computer engineering to the essential diagnostic problem in glaucoma - detecting change or stability in optic disc images over time. Expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in clinical glaucoma, translational research (R. Stone, PI; E. Miller, J. Piltz-Seymour and others) and biostatistics (M. Maguire, G.-S. Ying) is merged with engineering expertise in computer image analysis at Sarnoff Corporation (B. Hanna, H. Sawhney, and others) in a Bioengineering Research Partnership with four Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate robust registration algorithms for automatic alignment of optic disc images; 2) Develop an automated multiple-view analysis approach to extract relative, local change parameters from optic disc stereo images; 3) Develop interactive tools to assist in observer grading of optic disc images and in clinical interpretation of the automated change detection and stereoscopic algorithms; and 4) Conduct initial validation studies of the optic disc change detection tools. Our plan to address stereo primarily differs from other approaches to optic nerve analysis, but it offers many advantages for validation, clinical care and research not possible with the instrument-specific formats of contemporary fundus analyzers. Requiring only a personal computer and software to analyze optic disc images, our approach is clinically intuitive, can accommodate improvements in software and camera technology, is compatible with many image formats, permits use of archived fundus photos and is cost-effective. The refined approach to stereo recovery will permit robust detection of optic disc stability or change, and it offers great promise for advancing optic nerve diagnosis in glaucoma.          n/a",Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma,8123240,R01EY017299,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Calculi', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fundus', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Optic Atrophy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'cost effective', 'digital imaging', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'improved', 'instrument', 'novel diagnostics', 'programs', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'validation studies']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2011,677070,0.004799126559423461
"Exploring Clinically-relevant Image Retrieval for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All people with diabetes have the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, a vision-threatening complication. Despite advances in diabetes care over the years, diabetic retinopathy remains a potentially devastating complication. Early detection and timely intervention or treatment can reduce the incidence of blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. Recent years, diagnosis based on digital retinal imaging has become an alternative to traditional face-to-face evaluation. The potential benefits of automated analysis of digital images of diabetic retinopathy have been shown in existing studies. However, no current computer-based systems can achieve the same level of performance of human experts. This application takes a new perspective in developing a computer-aided system for improved diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, by exploring novel computational methods for retrieving clinically-relevant images from archived database with prior diagnosis information, for a given novel image. Images are considered as being clinically relevant if they contain the same types of lesions with similar severity levels. Research and development on content-based retinal image search/retrieval is still in its infancy, with only limited success, largely due to the challenge of explicitly coding expert-knowledge into a computational algorithm. To deal with the challenge, this research project takes a distinctly different approach engaging a machine-learning approach, where a labeled image set is used to train a computer algorithm for analyzing other new images, with the focus of training on similarity in clinical relevance instead of image features. The training is enabled in part by the investigators' existing research on computer-based lesion simulation. One specific aim of the research is to build a content-based image retrieval system that can provide a clinician with instant reference to archival images that are clinically relevant to the image under diagnosis. This is an innovative way of exploiting vast expert knowledge hidden in libraries of previously-diagnosed digital images of diabetic retinopathy for a clinician's improved performance in diagnosis. Another specific aim is to build an image information management system for diabetic retinopathy that supports the deployment of the retrieval system in a realistic clinical setting. In addition to the retrieval system, the direct outcome of the research also includes automated evaluation algorithms for diabetic retinopathy images with potentially improved performance compared with existing methods. In particular, the design of the proposed work allows different configurations of the resultant system according to the specific needs of a physician.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project develops a computer-based system for improved diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, a vision- threatening complication in people with diabetes. Early detection and timely intervention or treatment can reduce the incidence of blindness, and the computer-based system can potentially improve not only the speed but also the accuracy in diagnosing or screening patients with diabetic retinopathy.           This project develops a computer-based system for improved diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, a vision- threatening complication in people with diabetes.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology. Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,7761085,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2010,463608,0.05040479503184072
"Integrating Quantitative Histological Image and Vascular Density Patterns for Pro    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With increasing detection of early CaP with improved diagnostic methodologies, it has become important to predict biologic behaviors and ""aggressivity"" to identify patients who might benefit from a ""wait and watch policy"" as opposed to those who need more aggressive strategies. Traditionally, T-stage, amount of cancer in the core biopsy, the Gleason grade, and PSA at diagnosis has been used to evaluate the prognosis in localized CaP. While the Gleason score is currently assumed to be the strongest prognostic marker for CaP, there is often considerably high inter-, intra-observer variability associated with Gleason grade determination by pathologists. While some newer markers have recently shown promise, none of these methods have individually proven to be accurate enough to serve routinely as a prognostic marker for CaP.  Recently, there has been a call to combine multiple prognostic markers to create an integrated meta-marker, with potentially greater accuracy in predicting CaP recurrence compared to any individual marker. While it is apparent that prognostic information resides in histopathology imagery in terms of the arrangement of nuclei and glands, sophisticated graph, and computerized image analysis algorithms are required to quantitatively model and characterize the architectural appearance of prostate cancer histopathology and thus provide a marker that is accurate and reproducible (unlike Gleason grade). In addition, while tumor micro-vascular density has been correlated to CaP outcome, prognostic information may also potentially reside in the specific spatial architectural arrangement of the micro-vascular network. The objective of the proposed work is to develop an integrated quantitative prognostic marker that combines information based on architectural arrangement of nuclear, glandular, and micro-vasculature network patterns on whole mount histology sections (WMHS) obtained via radical prostatectomy (RP) to predict prostate cancer recurrence.  The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims. For this project we will digitize approximately 100 annonymized WMHS obtained via RP that have been matched for Gleason score, stage, PSA, but with different clinical outcomes (half the patients having undergone cancer recurrence and the other not, following RP). Under Aim 1, segmentation algorithms will be developed to automatically identify cancerous nuclei, glands and tumor microvasculature (MV), stained immuno-histochemically via CD31. Under Aim 2 we will apply graph based image analysis algorithms to quantitatively characterize the architectural arrangement of CaP nuclei, glands and the MV network. These graph-based features will be integrated via a computerized machine learning algorithm to yield a numerical image based risk score (IbRiS) reflecting the CaP prognosis (disease recurrence or non-recurrence) of the patient. IbRiS will be evaluated in terms of its ability to distinguish between CaP progressors and non-progressors (matched for stage, Gleason grade, PSA), in a cohort of 50 independent studies (test set) for which survival and outcome data is available.  This project will be a collaboration between investigators at Rutgers University (RU) and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Data accrual will be done at UPENN while algorithmic development for computerized image analysis and classification will be carried out at RU.             The broad long term goal of this project is to develop an integrated image based histological biomarker for  predicting  prostate  cancer  (CaP)  survival  and  outcome  by  integrating  quantitative  image  signatures  that  define  tissue  architecture  and  vascular  density  patterns.  Sophisticated  image  analysis  and  graph  based  algorithms will be developed to yield an image based risk score (IbRis) to predict whether or not a CaP patient  will  have  disease  recurrence  following  treatment.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  IbRis  will  prove  to  be  a  better  prognostic marker compared to such traditional markers as Gleason score and PSA.

"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging. Given the ubiquitous use of microarray imaging in biomedicine, the project is thus expected to be of great impact on the biomedical community.",A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets,7845601,R21LM010042,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cells', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Hybridization Array', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Prevention', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'complex biological systems', 'data integration', 'database design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder prevention', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge of results', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'public health relevance', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'visual map']",NLM,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2010,186306,0.015955327263074737
"Camera-based Text Recognition from Complex Backgrounds for the Blind or Visually There are more than 10 million blind and visually impaired people living in America today. Recent technology developments in computer vision, digital cameras, and portable computers make it possible to assist these individuals by developing camera-based products that combine computer vision technology with other existing products.  Although a number of reading assistants have been designed specifically for people who are blind or visually impaired, reading text from complex backgrounds or non-flat surfaces is very challenging and has not yet been successfully addressed. Many everyday tasks involve these challenging conditions, such as reading instructions on vending machines, titles of books aligned on a shelf, instructions on medicine bottles or labels on soup cans.  This proposal focuses on the development of new computer vision algorithms to recognize text from complex backgrounds: 1) from backgrounds with multiple different colors (e.g .. the titles of books lined up on a shelf) and 2) from non-flat surfaces (e.g .. labels on medicine bottles or soup cans). The newly developed computer vision techniques will be integrated with off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products. Visual information will be captured via a head-mounted camera (on sunglasses or hat) and analyzed by a portable computer (PDA or cell phone), while the speech display will be outputted via mini speakers, earphones, or Bluetooth device. A practical reading system prototype will be produced to read text from complex backgrounds and non-flat surfaces. The system will be cost-effective since it requires only a head mounted camera (<US$100 for 1M resolution), a wearable computer (<US$300), and two mini-speakers or earphones. The price of ""ReadIRlS"" [74] OCR software is under $150 and the ""TextAloud"" speech synthesis software is about $30 [75].  This project will be executed over two years at the City College of New York (CCNY) and Lighthouse International, New York. CCNY, located in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, is designated as both a Minority Institution and a Hispanic-serving Institution (37% Hispanic and 27% African American). Lighthouse International is a leading non-profit organization dedicated to preserving vision and to providing critically needed vision and rehabilitation services to help people of all ages overcome the challenges of vision loss. During the two years, we will 1) develop new algorithms to recognize text from backgrounds with multiple different colors; 2) develop new algorithms to recognize text from non-flat surfaces; and 3) develop a cost-effective prototype reading system for blind users by integrating with off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products. The effectiveness of the prototype and algorithms will be evaluated by people with normal vision and people with vision impairment. A database of text on complex backgrounds (multiple colors and non-flat surfaces) will be created for algorithm and system evaluation. The database will be made available to research communities in the areas of computer vision and vision rehabilitation science. In summary, this effort will provide a research-based foundation to inform the design of next generation reading assistants for blind persons, as well as produce a practical prototype to help the blind user read text from complex backgrounds in real-world environments. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of the proposed research is to develop new computer vision algorithms for camera-based text recognition from complex backgrounds and non-flat surfaces, as well as produce a practical reading system prototype in combination with off-the-shelf  optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products, to help blind or visually impaired people read instructions on vending machines, titles of books aligned on a shelf, labels on medicine bottles or soup cans, etc. Visual information will be captured via a head-mounted camera (on sunglasses or hat) and analyzed in realtime through a portable computer, such as a mini laptop or a personal digital assistant (PDA).

"Heterogeneous in situ data: Kernals, Distances and Trees    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to provide biologists with new tools to help them understand complex systems for which they have different sources of heterogeneous 'in situ' data. These data present many levels of heterogeneity and come concurrently with spatio-temporal and prior information that need to be incorporated into integrated data structures.  This collaboration starts with the design of the collection process and provides tools for data integration and analysis written around the statistics package R and an interactive image analysis program GEMEDENT written in JAVA.  The project concentrates on two specific types of heterogeneous data: metagenomic data and sequence mixtures provided by the new pyrosequencing machines and cell image data provided by automated microscopes.  The first type of heterogeneous data are microbial soil sample data collected by Alfred Spormann from Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford. The proposal focuses on applying Bayesian computations in the design of sample locations and number of sequences collected and then using spectral multivariate methods to analyze diversity indices as tables (instead of summaries), thus incorporating the data structure into the decompositions. These methods will also be useful in the study of mixture data from pyrosequencing HIV, bacteria, viruses and cancer cells.  The second study focuses on the interaction between immune cells and breast cancer in a collaboration with Peter Lee, hematologist at Stanford. We will analyze data from microscope images of stained lymph nodes. An integrated image analysis system enables the automatic detection of the location and size of many different cell types from stained images. Random forests have been incorporated into the image analysis system and an effective interactive boosting component provides the user with the possibility to iterate the learning process until a desired level of accuracy is attained. These data enable us to infer the spatial and dynamic interaction between the tumors and the immune cells. A postdoctoral fellow will be in charge of combining the cell data with the clinical history and the micro-array expression data from the same patient. The heterogeneity will be dealt with by using exploratory multivariate techniques based on spectral analysis, kernel methods and graphical representations.          n/a","Heterogeneous in situ data: Kernals, Distances and Trees",7877019,R01GM086884,"['Bacteria', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Environmental Engineering technology', 'HIV', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'In Situ', 'Java', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Patients', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Virus', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'data integration', 'data structure', 'design', 'forest', 'indexing', 'lymph nodes', 'microbial', 'programs', 'soil sampling', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,223070,-0.02295577280670343
"A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system based on standard camera cell phones to give blind and visually impaired persons the ability to read appliance displays and similar forms of non-document visual information. This ability is increasingly necessary to use everyday appliances such as microwave ovens and DVD players, and to perform many daily activities such as counting paper money. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed software runs on a standard, off-the- shelf camera phone and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze images taken by the user, to detect and read the text within each image, and to then read it aloud using synthesized speech. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that current cellular phones easily exceed the minimum processing power required for these tasks. Initially, the software will read out three categories of symbols: LED/LCD appliance displays, product or user-defined barcodes, and denominations of paper money. Ultimately these functions will be integrated with other capabilities being developed under separate funding, such as reading a broad range of printed text (including signs), recognizing objects, and analyzing photographs and graphics, etc., all available as free or low-cost software downloads for any cell phone user. Our specific goals are to (1) gather a database of real images taken by blind and visually impaired persons of a variety of LED/LCD appliance displays, barcodes and US paper currency; (2) develop algorithms to process the images and extract the desired information; (3) implement the algorithms on a camera phone; and (4) conduct user testing to establish design parameters and optimize the human interface. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays, and to other types of text and symbolic information hitherto unaddressed by rehabilitation technology. The proposed research would result in an assistive technology system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to provide increased access to such display and non- document text information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.          n/a",A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons,7799708,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Lavandula', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modification', 'Paper', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Voice', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'image processing', 'meetings', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'optical character recognition', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation technology', 'response', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'visual information', 'web site']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2010,427932,-0.00026868080655382696
"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired.

"A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer"", an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support ""human-in-the-loop"" interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

"Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software with Automated Gating    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is used to rapidly gather large quantities of data on cell type and function. The manual process of classifying hundreds of thousands of cells forms a bottleneck in diagnostics, high-throughput screening, clinical trials, and large-scale research experiments. The process currently requires a trained technician to identify populations on a digital graph of the data by manually drawing regions. As the complexity of the data increases, this gating task becomes more lengthy and laborious, and it is increasingly clear that minimizing human processing is essential to increasing both throughput and consistency. In clinical tests and diagnostic environments, automated gating would eliminate a complex set of human instructions and decisions in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), thereby reducing error and speeding results to the doctor. In many cases, the software will be able to recognize the need for additional tests before the doctor has an opportunity to look at the first report. Currently no software is available to perform complex multi-parameter analyses in an automated and rigorously validated manner. FlowDx will fill an important gap in the evolution of the technology and pave the way for ever larger phenotypic studies and for the translation of this research process to a clinical environment. Specific Aims 1) Fully define the experimental protocol, whereby a researcher can compare two or more classifications of identical data sets to study the differences, biases and effectiveness of human and algorithmic classifiers. 2) Describe and evaluate metrics that compare the performance of classification algorithms. 3) Conduct analytical experiments on our identified use cases, illustrating the potential of this technique to affect clinical analysis. 4) Iteratively implement the tools to automate these experiments, improve the experimental capabilities, and collaborate in new use cases. These aims will be satisfied while maintaining quantitative standards of software quality, establishing measurements in system uptime, throughput and robustness to set the baseline for subsequent iterations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FlowDx, a Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software Project is designed to create a new, more efficient, and more effective way of analyzing cells for the presence of cancer, HIV/ AIDS, and other diseases, using a fully automated software system. Using Magnetic Gating, Probability Clustering, Subtractive Cluster Analysis, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), Tree Star software will analyze the cell samples from patients at a much faster rate and with fewer false positives and negatives than the manual method now in use. The FlowDx Project 1) Fits the ""translational medicine"" model of the NIH Roadmap 2) Reduces error in the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases 3) Speeds results to physicians. Patients learn the outcome more quickly. Therapeutic intervention is faster. 4) Accommodates large-scale research by allowing greater volumes of complex data to be much more quickly examined, compared, and quantified 5) Reduces the expense of cell analysis by as much as 50% 6) Conforms to 21CFR Part 11 guidance           Narrative FlowDx, a Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software Project is designed to create a new, more efficient, and more effective way of analyzing cells for the presence of cancer, HIV/ AIDS, and other diseases, using a fully automated software system.

"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.        Re: Project Title: Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision  FOA: PHS 2009-02 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH, CDC, FDA and ACF for Small Business  Innovation Research Grant Applications (Parent SBIR [R43/R44])  Proposed project period: April 1, 2010 - March 31, 2012  Principal Investigator: Hallinan, Peter W.

"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems. Discoveries and concrete advances made in this study will contribute to solutions for effective use of digital images-a problem that is central to research and application across science, technology, and medicine. Advancements in our understanding of the design of useful and usable information systems will benefit society at large and contribute to the public health.

"Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma diagnosis, management and research depend on complex judgments of the optic disc (or optic nerve head), visual field and intraocular pressure. The current standard of optic disc evaluation requires qualitative observer judgments of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc, a less than optimal method. Despite much research, no methods have yet conclusively improved over this conventional Approach: Contemporary optic disc analyzers typically use instrument-specific image capture methods and derive quantitative estimates for various anatomical features of the optic disc. Our goal is to improve the methods of optic disc diagnosis by applying advanced image analysis methods from computer engineering to the essential diagnostic problem in glaucoma - detecting change or stability in optic disc images over time. Expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in clinical glaucoma, translational research (R. Stone, PI; E. Miller, J. Piltz-Seymour and others) and biostatistics (M. Maguire, G.-S. Ying) is merged with engineering expertise in computer image analysis at Sarnoff Corporation (B. Hanna, H. Sawhney, and others) in a Bioengineering Research Partnership with four Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate robust registration algorithms for automatic alignment of optic disc images; 2) Develop an automated multiple-view analysis approach to extract relative, local change parameters from optic disc stereo images; 3) Develop interactive tools to assist in observer grading of optic disc images and in clinical interpretation of the automated change detection and stereoscopic algorithms; and 4) Conduct initial validation studies of the optic disc change detection tools. Our plan to address stereo primarily differs from other approaches to optic nerve analysis, but it offers many advantages for validation, clinical care and research not possible with the instrument-specific formats of contemporary fundus analyzers. Requiring only a personal computer and software to analyze optic disc images, our approach is clinically intuitive, can accommodate improvements in software and camera technology, is compatible with many image formats, permits use of archived fundus photos and is cost-effective. The refined approach to stereo recovery will permit robust detection of optic disc stability or change, and it offers great promise for advancing optic nerve diagnosis in glaucoma.          n/a",Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma,7936871,R01EY017299,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Calculi', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fundus', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Optic Atrophy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'improved', 'instrument', 'novel diagnostics', 'programs', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,805328,0.004799126559423461
"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra. The proposed protocol will incorporate three discrete phases: 1) technology development, integration, and testing; 2) validity testing with a controlled diet (metabolic ward study); and 3) real-world utility testing. Validity of the data collected will be judged by how closely the nutrient calculations match the known composition of the metabolic ward diets consumed.

"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra. The proposed protocol will incorporate three discrete phases: 1) technology development, integration, and testing; 2) validity testing with a controlled diet (metabolic ward study); and 3) real-world utility testing. Validity of the data collected will be judged by how closely the nutrient calculations match the known composition of the metabolic ward diets consumed.

"Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmentation of detailed, patient-specific models from medical imagery can provide invaluable assistance for surgical planning and navigation. Current segmentation methods often make errors when confronted with subtle intensity boundaries. Adding knowledge of expected shape of a structure, and the range of normal variations in shape, can greatly improve segmentation, by guiding it towards the most likely shape consistent with the image information. The resulting segmentations can be used to plan surgical procedures, and when registered to the patient, can provide navigational guidance around critical structures. Many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and Fetal Growth Restriction, affect the shape of specific anatomical areas. To understand the development and progression of these diseases, as well as to develop methods for classifying instances into diseased or normal classes, 1 needs methods that capture differences in shape distributions between populations. Our goal is to develop and validate methods for learning from images concise representations of anatomical shape and its variability, Modeling shape distributions will improve segmentation algorithms by biasing the search towards more likely shapes. It will also enable quantitative analysis based on shape in population studies, where imaging is used to study differences in anatomy between populations, as well as changes within a population, for example with age. The proposed research builds on prior methods for segmentation and shape analysis, using tools from computer vision and machine learning applied to questions of shape representation, shape based segmentation and shape analysis for population studies. We plan to further develop the methods and to validate them with our collaborators in several different applications, including surgical planning, neonatal imaging and image-based studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease.            n/a",Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions,7560409,R01NS051826,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Back', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'computer studies', 'disease classification', 'feeding', 'improved', 'neonate', 'nervous system disorder', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'shape analysis', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2009,280500,-0.0026708881959379934

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          n/a","Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation",7739714,K99LM009889,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Distance Learning', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer site', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'meetings', 'oncology', 'open source', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2009,104963,0.010468726492283888
"Integrating Quantitative Histological Image and Vascular Density Patterns for Pro    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With increasing detection of early CaP with improved diagnostic methodologies, it has become important to predict biologic behaviors and ""aggressivity"" to identify patients who might benefit from a ""wait and watch policy"" as opposed to those who need more aggressive strategies. Traditionally, T-stage, amount of cancer in the core biopsy, the Gleason grade, and PSA at diagnosis has been used to evaluate the prognosis in localized CaP. While the Gleason score is currently assumed to be the strongest prognostic marker for CaP, there is often considerably high inter-, intra-observer variability associated with Gleason grade determination by pathologists. While some newer markers have recently shown promise, none of these methods have individually proven to be accurate enough to serve routinely as a prognostic marker for CaP.  Recently, there has been a call to combine multiple prognostic markers to create an integrated meta-marker, with potentially greater accuracy in predicting CaP recurrence compared to any individual marker. While it is apparent that prognostic information resides in histopathology imagery in terms of the arrangement of nuclei and glands, sophisticated graph, and computerized image analysis algorithms are required to quantitatively model and characterize the architectural appearance of prostate cancer histopathology and thus provide a marker that is accurate and reproducible (unlike Gleason grade). In addition, while tumor micro-vascular density has been correlated to CaP outcome, prognostic information may also potentially reside in the specific spatial architectural arrangement of the micro-vascular network. The objective of the proposed work is to develop an integrated quantitative prognostic marker that combines information based on architectural arrangement of nuclear, glandular, and micro-vasculature network patterns on whole mount histology sections (WMHS) obtained via radical prostatectomy (RP) to predict prostate cancer recurrence.  The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims. For this project we will digitize approximately 100 annonymized WMHS obtained via RP that have been matched for Gleason score, stage, PSA, but with different clinical outcomes (half the patients having undergone cancer recurrence and the other not, following RP). Under Aim 1, segmentation algorithms will be developed to automatically identify cancerous nuclei, glands and tumor microvasculature (MV), stained immuno-histochemically via CD31. Under Aim 2 we will apply graph based image analysis algorithms to quantitatively characterize the architectural arrangement of CaP nuclei, glands and the MV network. These graph-based features will be integrated via a computerized machine learning algorithm to yield a numerical image based risk score (IbRiS) reflecting the CaP prognosis (disease recurrence or non-recurrence) of the patient. IbRiS will be evaluated in terms of its ability to distinguish between CaP progressors and non-progressors (matched for stage, Gleason grade, PSA), in a cohort of 50 independent studies (test set) for which survival and outcome data is available.  This project will be a collaboration between investigators at Rutgers University (RU) and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Data accrual will be done at UPENN while algorithmic development for computerized image analysis and classification will be carried out at RU.             The broad long term goal of this project is to develop an integrated image based histological biomarker for  predicting  prostate  cancer  (CaP)  survival  and  outcome  by  integrating  quantitative  image  signatures  that  define  tissue  architecture  and  vascular  density  patterns.  Sophisticated  image  analysis  and  graph  based  algorithms will be developed to yield an image based risk score (IbRis) to predict whether or not a CaP patient  will  have  disease  recurrence  following  treatment.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  IbRis  will  prove  to  be  a  better  prognostic marker compared to such traditional markers as Gleason score and PSA.

"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging.

"Accurate detection of chromosomal abnormalities with multi-color image processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The combination of high resolution assays in genomics with microscopic imaging has been used for the detection of complex chromosomal rearrangements, a significant but difficult problem in prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, birth defect detection and cancer research. As a recently developed molecular cytogenetic technique, multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) imaging has provided rapid and high resolution detection of chromosomal abnormalities associated with cancer and genetic disorders. However, the technique is currently limited to research use and only serves as an adjunct tool to the G-banding based monochromatic chromosomal karyotyping in a clinical laboratory. A primary barrier of the technique is the lower classification accuracy when classifying chromosomes from multi-color microscopic imaging data. Therefore, the goal of this R15 project is to develop innovative multi-spectral image processing and machine learning techniques for M-FISH image analysis so that chromosomal rearrangement detection can be made more reproducible, robust, and faster, thereby significantly increasing the ability and efficacy of this newly developed cellular imaging technique. Our proposed approaches such as multiscale feature extraction, nonlinear manifold analysis and adaptive fuzzy clustering are able to target specific features of multi-spectral imaging data, promising a significant improvement over the current techniques. In order to validate the technique and bring it into clinical use, we will partner with a clinical geneticist, Dr. Merlin Butler, and a cytogeneticist, Dr. Diane Persons both at Kansas University Medical Center. In addition, we will collaborate with an industrial scientist, Dr. Kenneth Castleman, who is the pioneer in developing and commercializing cytogenetic imaging products. Through our interdisciplinary research and collaboration, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) develop image normalization approaches to improve the acquisition of multi-color FISH images; 2) develop multiscale dimension analysis to extract features from multi-color images; 3) design adaptive fuzzy clustering and incorporate contextual information to improve the pixel-wise classification of chromosomes; and 4) validate computational approaches with clinical testing in collaboration with medical and industrial partners. This research project will also enhance our research infrastructure in biomedical image informatics and provide undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to touch the frontier of molecular and cellular imaging by participating in the proposed research activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses. Our proposed approaches have the potential to significantly improve the reliability of the newly developed M-FISH imaging technique, making it feasible for clinical use. This will in turn benefit the health of human beings. Furthermore, the developed computational techniques can be applicable to a wide range of multi-color bio-imaging problems, thereby having a broad impact on the biomedical community.           Project Narrative Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses.

"Heterogeneous in situ data: Kernals, Distances and Trees    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to provide biologists with new tools to help them understand complex systems for which they have different sources of heterogeneous 'in situ' data. These data present many levels of heterogeneity and come concurrently with spatio-temporal and prior information that need to be incorporated into integrated data structures.  This collaboration starts with the design of the collection process and provides tools for data integration and analysis written around the statistics package R and an interactive image analysis program GEMEDENT written in JAVA.  The project concentrates on two specific types of heterogeneous data: metagenomic data and sequence mixtures provided by the new pyrosequencing machines and cell image data provided by automated microscopes.  The first type of heterogeneous data are microbial soil sample data collected by Alfred Spormann from Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford. The proposal focuses on applying Bayesian computations in the design of sample locations and number of sequences collected and then using spectral multivariate methods to analyze diversity indices as tables (instead of summaries), thus incorporating the data structure into the decompositions. These methods will also be useful in the study of mixture data from pyrosequencing HIV, bacteria, viruses and cancer cells.  The second study focuses on the interaction between immune cells and breast cancer in a collaboration with Peter Lee, hematologist at Stanford. We will analyze data from microscope images of stained lymph nodes. An integrated image analysis system enables the automatic detection of the location and size of many different cell types from stained images. Random forests have been incorporated into the image analysis system and an effective interactive boosting component provides the user with the possibility to iterate the learning process until a desired level of accuracy is attained. These data enable us to infer the spatial and dynamic interaction between the tumors and the immune cells. A postdoctoral fellow will be in charge of combining the cell data with the clinical history and the micro-array expression data from the same patient. The heterogeneity will be dealt with by using exploratory multivariate techniques based on spectral analysis, kernel methods and graphical representations.          n/a","Heterogeneous in situ data: Kernals, Distances and Trees",7664924,R01GM086884,"['Bacteria', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Environmental Engineering technology', 'HIV', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'In Situ', 'Java', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Patients', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Virus', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'data integration', 'data structure', 'design', 'forest', 'indexing', 'lymph nodes', 'microbial', 'programs', 'soil sampling', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,225323,-0.02295577280670343
"A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system based on standard camera cell phones to give blind and visually impaired persons the ability to read appliance displays and similar forms of non-document visual information. This ability is increasingly necessary to use everyday appliances such as microwave ovens and DVD players, and to perform many daily activities such as counting paper money. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed software runs on a standard, off-the- shelf camera phone and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze images taken by the user, to detect and read the text within each image, and to then read it aloud using synthesized speech. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that current cellular phones easily exceed the minimum processing power required for these tasks. Initially, the software will read out three categories of symbols: LED/LCD appliance displays, product or user-defined barcodes, and denominations of paper money. Ultimately these functions will be integrated with other capabilities being developed under separate funding, such as reading a broad range of printed text (including signs), recognizing objects, and analyzing photographs and graphics, etc., all available as free or low-cost software downloads for any cell phone user. Our specific goals are to (1) gather a database of real images taken by blind and visually impaired persons of a variety of LED/LCD appliance displays, barcodes and US paper currency; (2) develop algorithms to process the images and extract the desired information; (3) implement the algorithms on a camera phone; and (4) conduct user testing to establish design parameters and optimize the human interface. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays, and to other types of text and symbolic information hitherto unaddressed by rehabilitation technology. The proposed research would result in an assistive technology system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to provide increased access to such display and non- document text information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.          n/a",A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons,7589644,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Lavandula', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modification', 'Paper', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Voice', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'image processing', 'meetings', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'optical character recognition', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation technology', 'response', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'visual information', 'web site']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2009,426946,-0.00026868080655382696
"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,7837005,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'computer program', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard measure', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2009,229517,0.008760749440830764

"National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI) The National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC) is a multiinstitutional, interdisciplinary team of  computer scientists, software engineers, and medical investigators who develop computational tools for the  analysis and visualization of medical image data. The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure  and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then  oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class  software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and  deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team  combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state  of the art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed,  open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neurosience and neurologicat  disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open  systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of  schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open  systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures  and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the  etiology of schizophrenia. The overall analysis will occur at a range of scales, and will occur across a range  of modalities including diffusion MRI, quantitative EGG, and metabolic and receptor PET, but potentially  including microscopic, genomic, and other image data.

"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7850408,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2009,26557,-0.02302941533277198
"A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer"", an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support ""human-in-the-loop"" interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

"Detection of Drug Effects in Small Groups Using PET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop optimized image analysis pipelines for pharmaceutical evaluation based on functional neuroimaging, in particular based on positron emission tomography (PET). Strength of drug effect will be assessed using statistical measures of detection power, reproducibility of spatial activation patterns, and regional power estimates. Spatial parametric images will be computed for each of the prediction models investigated. A wide range of predictive models, including many that are new to the functional neuroimaging field, will be implemented and evaluated within a sophisticated statistical resampling framework. A grid-aware software package will be developed based on the results obtained. This software is intended to be run in-house in a distributed computing environment at Predictek to provide state-of-the-art optimized image analysis services to its customers. A scaled-down user-friendly Java implementation of some of the best- performing methods (based on evaluations performed in the project) will also be developed for distribution to end users wishing to perform advanced analyses themselves.

"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra.

"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra. The proposed protocol will incorporate three discrete phases: 1) technology development, integration, and testing; 2) validity testing with a controlled diet (metabolic ward study); and 3) real-world utility testing. Validity of the data collected will be judged by how closely the nutrient calculations match the known composition of the metabolic ward diets consumed.

"Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma diagnosis, management and research depend on complex judgments of the optic disc (or optic nerve head), visual field and intraocular pressure. The current standard of optic disc evaluation requires qualitative observer judgments of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc, a less than optimal method. Despite much research, no methods have yet conclusively improved over this conventional Approach: Contemporary optic disc analyzers typically use instrument-specific image capture methods and derive quantitative estimates for various anatomical features of the optic disc. Our goal is to improve the methods of optic disc diagnosis by applying advanced image analysis methods from computer engineering to the essential diagnostic problem in glaucoma - detecting change or stability in optic disc images over time. Expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in clinical glaucoma, translational research (R. Stone, PI; E. Miller, J. Piltz-Seymour and others) and biostatistics (M. Maguire, G.-S. Ying) is merged with engineering expertise in computer image analysis at Sarnoff Corporation (B. Hanna, H. Sawhney, and others) in a Bioengineering Research Partnership with four Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate robust registration algorithms for automatic alignment of optic disc images; 2) Develop an automated multiple-view analysis approach to extract relative, local change parameters from optic disc stereo images; 3) Develop interactive tools to assist in observer grading of optic disc images and in clinical interpretation of the automated change detection and stereoscopic algorithms; and 4) Conduct initial validation studies of the optic disc change detection tools. Our plan to address stereo primarily differs from other approaches to optic nerve analysis, but it offers many advantages for validation, clinical care and research not possible with the instrument-specific formats of contemporary fundus analyzers. Requiring only a personal computer and software to analyze optic disc images, our approach is clinically intuitive, can accommodate improvements in software and camera technology, is compatible with many image formats, permits use of archived fundus photos and is cost-effective. The refined approach to stereo recovery will permit robust detection of optic disc stability or change, and it offers great promise for advancing optic nerve diagnosis in glaucoma.          n/a",Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma,7686733,R01EY017299,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Calculi', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fundus', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Optic Atrophy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'image registration', 'improved', 'instrument', 'novel diagnostics', 'programs', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2009,819428,0.004799126559423461
"Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmentation of detailed, patient-specific models from medical imagery can provide invaluable assistance for surgical planning and navigation. Current segmentation methods often make errors when confronted with subtle intensity boundaries. Adding knowledge of expected shape of a structure, and the range of normal variations in shape, can greatly improve segmentation, by guiding it towards the most likely shape consistent with the image information. The resulting segmentations can be used to plan surgical procedures, and when registered to the patient, can provide navigational guidance around critical structures. Many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and Fetal Growth Restriction, affect the shape of specific anatomical areas. To understand the development and progression of these diseases, as well as to develop methods for classifying instances into diseased or normal classes, 1 needs methods that capture differences in shape distributions between populations. Our goal is to develop and validate methods for learning from images concise representations of anatomical shape and its variability, Modeling shape distributions will improve segmentation algorithms by biasing the search towards more likely shapes. It will also enable quantitative analysis based on shape in population studies, where imaging is used to study differences in anatomy between populations, as well as changes within a population, for example with age. The proposed research builds on prior methods for segmentation and shape analysis, using tools from computer vision and machine learning applied to questions of shape representation, shape based segmentation and shape analysis for population studies. We plan to further develop the methods and to validate them with our collaborators in several different applications, including surgical planning, neonatal imaging and image-based studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease.            n/a",Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions,7351765,R01NS051826,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Back', 'Class', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse Pattern', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Localized', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Range', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'computer studies', 'desire', 'disease classification', 'feeding', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'neonate', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'shape analysis', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2008,281588,-0.0026708881959379934
"Heterogeneous in situ data: Kernals, Distances and Trees    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to provide biologists with new tools to help them understand complex systems for which they have different sources of heterogeneous 'in situ' data. These data present many levels of heterogeneity and come concurrently with spatio-temporal and prior information that need to be incorporated into integrated data structures.  This collaboration starts with the design of the collection process and provides tools for data integration and analysis written around the statistics package R and an interactive image analysis program GEMEDENT written in JAVA.  The project concentrates on two specific types of heterogeneous data: metagenomic data and sequence mixtures provided by the new pyrosequencing machines and cell image data provided by automated microscopes.  The first type of heterogeneous data are microbial soil sample data collected by Alfred Spormann from Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford. The proposal focuses on applying Bayesian computations in the design of sample locations and number of sequences collected and then using spectral multivariate methods to analyze diversity indices as tables (instead of summaries), thus incorporating the data structure into the decompositions. These methods will also be useful in the study of mixture data from pyrosequencing HIV, bacteria, viruses and cancer cells.  The second study focuses on the interaction between immune cells and breast cancer in a collaboration with Peter Lee, hematologist at Stanford. We will analyze data from microscope images of stained lymph nodes. An integrated image analysis system enables the automatic detection of the location and size of many different cell types from stained images. Random forests have been incorporated into the image analysis system and an effective interactive boosting component provides the user with the possibility to iterate the learning process until a desired level of accuracy is attained. These data enable us to infer the spatial and dynamic interaction between the tumors and the immune cells. A postdoctoral fellow will be in charge of combining the cell data with the clinical history and the micro-array expression data from the same patient. The heterogeneity will be dealt with by using exploratory multivariate techniques based on spectral analysis, kernel methods and graphical representations.          n/a","Heterogeneous in situ data: Kernals, Distances and Trees",7596500,R01GM086884,"['Bacteria', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Environmental Engineering technology', 'HIV', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'In Situ', 'Java', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Virus', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'data integration', 'data structure', 'design', 'desire', 'forest', 'indexing', 'lymph nodes', 'microbial', 'programs', 'size', 'soil sampling', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,225323,-0.02295577280670343
"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA. The candidate obtained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in December 2005 and had intensive training on medical imaging. She increased her interest in medical image quality assessment during the development of three-class ROC analysis; her knowledge of the statistics and decision theory principals used in this research is self-taught. Further exploring new areas opened by three- class ROC analysis requires systematic understanding of the statistical principles in decision theory, statistical learning, and Bayesian modeling, etc. Thus, she requests a two-year mentored phase focusing on formal biostatistics training. The training phase will substantially enhance the candidate's career development as an interdisciplinary investigator and contribute to her independent research to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to establish the theoretical foundations of three-class ROC analysis; (2) to develop general statistical methods for three-class ROC analysis; (3) to apply the three-class methodologies to task-based medical image quality assessment. The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. First, it provides a rigorous solution to an open theoretical problem and will open new areas of theoretical research in ROC analysis and medical decision making. Second, it enables applications of task-based assessment techniques for multi-class diagnosis. These techniques have the potential to fundamentally improve current imaging techniques for disease detection and characterization, and thus to enhance doctors' performance in disease diagnosis, which will broadly benefit public health.          n/a",Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment,7480255,K99EB007620,"['Area', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical assessment', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'statistics']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2008,89733,-0.010361241357808788
"A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system based on standard camera cell phones to give blind and visually impaired persons the ability to read appliance displays and similar forms of non-document visual information. This ability is increasingly necessary to use everyday appliances such as microwave ovens and DVD players, and to perform many daily activities such as counting paper money. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed software runs on a standard, off-the- shelf camera phone and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze images taken by the user, to detect and read the text within each image, and to then read it aloud using synthesized speech. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that current cellular phones easily exceed the minimum processing power required for these tasks. Initially, the software will read out three categories of symbols: LED/LCD appliance displays, product or user-defined barcodes, and denominations of paper money. Ultimately these functions will be integrated with other capabilities being developed under separate funding, such as reading a broad range of printed text (including signs), recognizing objects, and analyzing photographs and graphics, etc., all available as free or low-cost software downloads for any cell phone user. Our specific goals are to (1) gather a database of real images taken by blind and visually impaired persons of a variety of LED/LCD appliance displays, barcodes and US paper currency; (2) develop algorithms to process the images and extract the desired information; (3) implement the algorithms on a camera phone; and (4) conduct user testing to establish design parameters and optimize the human interface. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays, and to other types of text and symbolic information hitherto unaddressed by rehabilitation technology. The proposed research would result in an assistive technology system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to provide increased access to such display and non- document text information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.          n/a",A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons,7446299,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Count', 'Custom', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Lavandula', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modification', 'Paper', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Voice', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'desire', 'image processing', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'optical character recognition', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rehabilitation technology', 'response', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'visual information']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2008,421791,-0.00026868080655382696
"Toward Quantitative Disease Assessment from Capsule Endoscopy Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Capsule endoscopy has recently emerged as a valuable imaging technology for the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially the small bowel and the esophagus. With this technology, it has become possible to directly evaluate the gut mucosa of patients with a variety of conditions, such as obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, celiac disease and Crohn's disease. Although the use of capsule endoscopy is gaining rapidly, the evaluation of capsule endoscopic imagery presents numerous practical challenges. In a typical case, the capsule acquires 50,000 or more images over an eight-hour period. The quality of these images is highly variable due to the uncontrolled motion of the capsule itself as it moves through the GI tract, the complexity of the structures being imaged, and inherent limitations of the imager itself. In practice, relatively few (often less than 100) of these images contain significant diagnostic content. As a result, it is challenging to create an effective, repeatable means for evaluating capsule endoscopic sequences. The goal of this project is create a tool for semi-automated, objective, quantitative assessment of pathologic findings in capsule endoscopic data. The clinical focus will be on quantitative assessment of lesions that appear in Crohn's disease of the small bowel. The technical approach to this problem will make use of statistical learning methods to create algorithms that perform lesion classification and assessment in a manner consistent with a trained expert. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that appropriately constructed algorithms will be able to perform assessment of lesions appearing in capsule endoscopic images with a level of consistency comparable to human observers. In proving this hypothesis, the proposed project will pursue the following three specific aims:       Aim 1: Data acquisition. To develop a substantial database of images of intestinal lesions together with an expert assessment of several attributes indicative of lesion severity.       Aim 2: Tissue classification and image enhancement. To develop algorithms for low-level classification of tissue type from image content using statistical learning techniques, and to create algorithms for registering multiple partial views of a lesion to create more complete views.       Aim 3: Automated Lesion Assessment. To apply and validate statistical learning methods that can assess the images produced by Aim 2 in a manner consistent with the expert assessments compiled in Aim 1.       The focus of this R21 is on the development of tools that have proven efficacy on a representative corpus of data. This will set the stage for subsequent technological developments leading toward the automated detection of lesions, and subsequent clinical studies addressing the development of quantitative measures for Crohn's disease severity in a more substantial clinical setting.          n/a",Toward Quantitative Disease Assessment from Capsule Endoscopy Images,7496032,R21EB008227,"['Address', 'Aggressive Clinical Course', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Celiac Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Condition', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Eating', 'End Point', 'Endoscopy', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Healed', 'Hemorrhage', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Intestines', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ulcer', 'base', 'capsule', 'data acquisition', 'gastrointestinal', 'healing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'size', 'small bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,189850,0.0015566007803098389
"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,7355521,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Score', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'computer program', 'desire', 'experience', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2008,431744,0.008760749440830764
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7471355,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Numbers', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'day', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2008,411777,-0.02302941533277198

"Detection of Drug Effects in Small Groups Using PET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop optimized image analysis pipelines for pharmaceutical evaluation based on functional neuroimaging, in particular based on positron emission tomography (PET). Strength of drug effect will be assessed using statistical measures of detection power, reproducibility of spatial activation patterns, and regional power estimates. Spatial parametric images will be computed for each of the prediction models investigated. A wide range of predictive models, including many that are new to the functional neuroimaging field, will be implemented and evaluated within a sophisticated statistical resampling framework. A grid-aware software package will be developed based on the results obtained. This software is intended to be run in-house in a distributed computing environment at Predictek to provide state-of-the-art optimized image analysis services to its customers. A scaled-down user-friendly Java implementation of some of the best- performing methods (based on evaluations performed in the project) will also be developed for distribution to end users wishing to perform advanced analyses themselves.

"Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software with Automated Gating    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software Project described in this grant application is designed to create a new, more efficient and effective way of analyzing cells for the presence of cancer, HIV/AIDS and other disease, using a fully automated software system. Using modern data mining techniques (pattern recognition, feature recognition, image analysis) we will design software which will analyze data (the cell samples from patients) at a much faster rate and with fewer false positives and negatives than the manual method now in use. Objectives: Assemble and validate algorithms in software that can automatically classify regions of interest in flow cytometry data. We will demonstrate that the particular populations required by our use cases can be validly, rigorously and repeatably identified automatically. Develop and validate graphical and statistical results that satisfy FDA requirements for medical device software, simplify regulatory compliance by the clinical user, and automatically deliver analysis results to diagnostic expert systems and/or LIMS systems. Satisfy the  translational medicine  goals outlined in the NIH Roadmap. This software will bring the clinician streamlined testing currently only available in research labs. Methods: Four use cases have been selected, one employing synthetic data and three clinical data; Leukemia/Lymphoma test, Analysis of longitudinal Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD) in bone marrow transplant specimens for predictive markers and HIV/AIDS - Gag-specific T cell cytokine response profile assay. For each we have access to a substantial body of existing data, analyzed by experts. Beginning with the autogating routines in our own FlowJo software, we will test and expand the application of Magnetic gating, Probability Clustering, Subtractive Cluster Analysis, Artificial Neural and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Using a sampling of human operators to establish a control range, we will test each of these five techniques against the four use cases in cooperation with our collaborators. Events in the manually classified samples are given a weighted score based on the frequency with which they are included by all the operators. A single operator's score or the gating algorithm's score is compared with the cumulative score of the expert group and a match rating is computed. Additional validation techniques include combinatory validation on internal measures with respect to Pareto optimality, and Predictive Power/Stability self consistency checks using resampled or perturbed data measured with external indices such as the adjusted Rand index and the Variation of Information index.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By eliminating the operator's time, we estimate that the cost of clinical flow cytometry analysis can be reduced to half the current figure while delivering the results much faster. By eliminating the subjectivity and human error of manually created regions and reducing the range of variability of the so created, there would result fewer false positives and false negatives, improving the clinical outcome for those patients needing therapy but undetected by current methods. An order of magnitude increase in speed means faster therapeutic intervention.  A less expensive test improves outcome by making the test accessible to more patients.          n/a",Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software with Automated Gating,7482923,R43RR024094,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Files', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gagging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Voting', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NCRR,"TREE STAR, INC.",R43,2008,100854,-0.013220836902314539

"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra. The proposed protocol will incorporate three discrete phases: 1) technology development, integration, and testing; 2) validity testing with a controlled diet (metabolic ward study); and 3) real-world utility testing. Validity of the data collected will be judged by how closely the nutrient calculations match the known composition of the metabolic ward diets consumed.

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,7467385,U24RR021382,[' '],NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2008,5140823,0.0008769399034604337
"Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma diagnosis, management and research depend on complex judgments of the optic disc (or optic nerve head), visual field and intraocular pressure. The current standard of optic disc evaluation requires qualitative observer judgments of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc, a less than optimal method. Despite much research, no methods have yet conclusively improved over this conventional Approach: Contemporary optic disc analyzers typically use instrument-specific image capture methods and derive quantitative estimates for various anatomical features of the optic disc. Our goal is to improve the methods of optic disc diagnosis by applying advanced image analysis methods from computer engineering to the essential diagnostic problem in glaucoma - detecting change or stability in optic disc images over time. Expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in clinical glaucoma, translational research (R. Stone, PI; E. Miller, J. Piltz-Seymour and others) and biostatistics (M. Maguire, G.-S. Ying) is merged with engineering expertise in computer image analysis at Sarnoff Corporation (B. Hanna, H. Sawhney, and others) in a Bioengineering Research Partnership with four Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate robust registration algorithms for automatic alignment of optic disc images; 2) Develop an automated multiple-view analysis approach to extract relative, local change parameters from optic disc stereo images; 3) Develop interactive tools to assist in observer grading of optic disc images and in clinical interpretation of the automated change detection and stereoscopic algorithms; and 4) Conduct initial validation studies of the optic disc change detection tools. Our plan to address stereo primarily differs from other approaches to optic nerve analysis, but it offers many advantages for validation, clinical care and research not possible with the instrument-specific formats of contemporary fundus analyzers. Requiring only a personal computer and software to analyze optic disc images, our approach is clinically intuitive, can accommodate improvements in software and camera technology, is compatible with many image formats, permits use of archived fundus photos and is cost-effective. The refined approach to stereo recovery will permit robust detection of optic disc stability or change, and it offers great promise for advancing optic nerve diagnosis in glaucoma.          n/a",Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma,7494022,R01EY017299,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Calculi', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Compatible', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fundus', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Numbers', 'Optic Atrophy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'day', 'digital imaging', 'image registration', 'improved', 'instrument', 'novel diagnostics', 'programs', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2008,856688,0.004799126559423461

The project will collaborate with the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) to develop the software using the NA-MIC Software Engineering Process, leverage the NA-MIC engineering infrastructure, and integrate this software into the 3D Slicer, a well-architected application environment being developed in NA-MIC. The particular software package will include both a brain image registration and warping algorithm, called HAMMER, and an algorithm for the segmentation of white matter lesions (WMLs), which can arise from a variety of pathologies including vascular pathology and multiple sclerosis. HAMMER received 2006 Best Paper Award from IEEE Signal Processing Society. HAMMER has been successfully applied to many large clinical research studies and clinical trials involving over 5,000 MR brain images and has been downloaded by 318 users from 102 institutions in over 20 countries. The WML segmentation algorithm has been successfully applied to ""Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Memory in Diabetes"" (ACCORD-MIND) sub- study, with data acquired from 4 centers on 650 patients over a period of 8 years. Designing an easy-to-use, robust software package for these two algorithms and incorporating it into the 3D Slicer will benefit a large community of end-users that need access to advanced image analysis methods in various neuroimaging studies. To increase the robustness of the algorithms to the highly variable quality and characteristics of clinical image data, further algorithm development is necessary. To increase ease of use by non-experts in computer analysis methods and integrate this software into the Slicer platform, significant software engineering efforts are planned. Three aims will be investigated. The first aim is to further develop and extend novel image analysis methods aiming at improving the robustness and performance of HAMMER registration and WML segmentation algorithms, so that they can be easily applied to various clinical research studies. The second and third aims are to design separate software modules for these two algorithms, and to incorporate them into the 3D Slicer. These two modules will be designed (1) with consistent cross-platform interactive and scripted interfaces, (2) allowing end-users to interactively explore the suitable parameters for their data, (3) enabling developers to add new functions. The robustness of these two modules will be extensively tested and improved by both software engineering tools and various clinical research data (acquired from different centers). The final software will be freely available in both source code and pre-compiled programs.

"Machine Learning Applied to Automated Planar Patch Clamps    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The introduction of automated planar patch clamp instruments over the past two years has increased the throughput of voltage clamp ion channel assays by a factor of at least ten. This is possible because the automated systems can perform assays in parallel using16 and 384-well plates. While the drug discovery industry has embraced this new technology, the enthusiasm has been tempered by the modest success rates of the assays and by the high cost of the consumable patch substrate. Currently, typical success rates for a standard ion channel assay, using, for example, the Q-Patch from Sophion Biosciences, the Port-a-Patch system from Nanion Biosciences, or the PatchXpress from Molecular Devices Corp., is around 50%. In other words, for every16 channel chip used in these systems, only eight will produce useable data. This effectively doubles the price of each data point over what is ideally possible. In order for a planar patch clamp experiment to succeed, several events need to occur (assuming that the cell expresses the appropriate ion channels in functional states): the cell of interest must form a high-resistance seal with the planar substrate, the whole-cell configuration must be achieved, and fluidic pathways must be intact so that compounds of interest maybe applied to the cell. A failure of anyone of these steps will result in no data collected from that well. We propose to optimize the first two steps in this process, namely, seal formation and entry into whole-cell recording configuration. We will use machine learning approaches to examine how a human patch clamp expert interacts with the patch clamp system in order to develop a model that will provide parameters that can be used to more efficiently and successfully provide useable whole-cell recording configuration. It is important to note that the model that we derive from our approach will not actually copy what the expert does, but will attempt to optimize the process based on cues that mayor may not be consciously monitored by the expert. The Specific Aims of the Phase I component will be to: (1) integrate recording capabilities into existing automated patch clamp software from Nanion, (2) evaluate the success rate of the procedure specified by our machine learning analysis, and (3) develop stand-alone software for use specifically with manual patch clamp setups and for exploration of the potential benefits of using machine learning via expert training in other applications. In Phase II we propose to develop the proof-of-concept software into a user-friendly commercial software module which we will offer to existing and potential automated patch clamp companies. We will also simplify and streamline the user interface of this software as a stand-alone component for manual patch clamp systems. Developing drugs that target ion channels has been hindered by the expense of the consumables used in automated patch clamp screening devices. We propose to develop a method, using machine learning techniques which may increase the success rate of these instruments and therefore lower the overall cost of ion channel drug discovery.          n/a",Machine Learning Applied to Automated Planar Patch Clamps,7220448,R43EB007148,"['Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Employee Strikes', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Ion Channel', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Running', 'Sales', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cell type', 'concept', 'cost', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'new technology', 'patch clamp', 'programs', 'research study', 'seal', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'voltage', 'voltage clamp']",NIBIB,BLATZ SCIENTIFIC,R43,2007,199389,-0.032220983670184396
"Computer Vision Methods for the Real Time Assessment of Dietary Intake    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Self- monitoring of all foods and beverages consumed is central to weight loss and maintenance efforts; however, this places a heavy burden on the user. These same burdens also impede nutritional research. The proposed research is for the testing of a semi-automated, objective, near real-time computer vision and pattern recognition approach to the measurement of dietary intake. In the proposed product, cell phone pictures of meals and snacks will be analyzed by software in an attempt to automatically recognize as many items as possible. A small number of intelligent yes/no questions will help provide additional information when necessary in order to meet the accuracy demands of the target application. Following identification of the items, the software will estimate the portion sizes of all identified items. The experiments comprising this Phase I SBIR are (a) extract the most informative sets of features using a large number of food and beverage items taken from an existing database of real world meal images, (b) compare the accuracy of candidate pattern recognition approaches to identify items based on the extracted features, (c) identify the most feasible algorithms for estimating portion size, and (d) test usability and user acceptance with a simulated version of the product. Phase II will (a) apply the approach to a greater variety of food and beverage items, (b) improve automated analysis, and (c) compare the approach to existing assessment instruments. This research will extend defense- and security-related technologies to the assessment and treatment of obesity.          n/a",Computer Vision Methods for the Real Time Assessment of Dietary Intake,7405586,R43CA124265,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calculi', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Class', 'Coin', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetic Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Food', 'Food and Beverages', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Intake', 'Iris', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Numbers', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritionist', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Placement', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Wing', 'base', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'obesity treatment', 'research study', 'size', 'usability']",NCI,"MEDIABALANCE, INC.",R43,2007,191710,0.006508747214524709
"Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmentation of detailed, patient-specific models from medical imagery can provide invaluable assistance for surgical planning and navigation. Current segmentation methods often make errors when confronted with subtle intensity boundaries. Adding knowledge of expected shape of a structure, and the range of normal variations in shape, can greatly improve segmentation, by guiding it towards the most likely shape consistent with the image information. The resulting segmentations can be used to plan surgical procedures, and when registered to the patient, can provide navigational guidance around critical structures. Many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and Fetal Growth Restriction, affect the shape of specific anatomical areas. To understand the development and progression of these diseases, as well as to develop methods for classifying instances into diseased or normal classes, 1 needs methods that capture differences in shape distributions between populations. Our goal is to develop and validate methods for learning from images concise representations of anatomical shape and its variability, Modeling shape distributions will improve segmentation algorithms by biasing the search towards more likely shapes. It will also enable quantitative analysis based on shape in population studies, where imaging is used to study differences in anatomy between populations, as well as changes within a population, for example with age. The proposed research builds on prior methods for segmentation and shape analysis, using tools from computer vision and machine learning applied to questions of shape representation, shape based segmentation and shape analysis for population studies. We plan to further develop the methods and to validate them with our collaborators in several different applications, including surgical planning, neonatal imaging and image-based studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease.            n/a",Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions,7186695,R01NS051826,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomic structures', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Biomechanics', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clutterings', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse Pattern', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'General Hospitals', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Link', 'Localized', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Premature Infant', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Models', 'Statistical Study', 'Statistically Significant', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'base', 'cohort', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'desire', 'deviant', 'disease classification', 'expectation', 'feeding', 'healthy aging', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neonate', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurosurgery', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2007,282619,-0.0026708881959379934
"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation). FDA-sanctioned clinical trials will be conducted in the third year, leading to submission of an application for a 510(k) clearance.         n/a",Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting,7278340,R44CA088684,"['Acute leukemia', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Aspirate substance', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blast Cell', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Compatible', 'Computer software', 'Count', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Reports', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Florida', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hematopathology', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Disease', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Schools', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Range', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Side', 'Slide', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Software Validation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'design', 'experience', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'leukemia', 'light microscopy', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'software development']",NCI,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R44,2007,1006481,0.013802858194245999
"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions. Optimization screens would be improved by applying Case-Based and Bayesian methods here as well as by further developments of automated image analysis. III. Improving the ""user friendliness,"" integration and automation of the entire system. n/a",Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization,7269383,R01RR014477,[' '],NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,307022,-0.026081690933400882
"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA. The candidate obtained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in December 2005 and had intensive training on medical imaging. She increased her interest in medical image quality assessment during the development of three-class ROC analysis; her knowledge of the statistics and decision theory principals used in this research is self-taught. Further exploring new areas opened by three- class ROC analysis requires systematic understanding of the statistical principles in decision theory, statistical learning, and Bayesian modeling, etc. Thus, she requests a two-year mentored phase focusing on formal biostatistics training. The training phase will substantially enhance the candidate's career development as an interdisciplinary investigator and contribute to her independent research to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to establish the theoretical foundations of three-class ROC analysis; (2) to develop general statistical methods for three-class ROC analysis; (3) to apply the three-class methodologies to task-based medical image quality assessment. The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. First, it provides a rigorous solution to an open theoretical problem and will open new areas of theoretical research in ROC analysis and medical decision making. Second, it enables applications of task-based assessment techniques for multi-class diagnosis. These techniques have the potential to fundamentally improve current imaging techniques for disease detection and characterization, and thus to enhance doctors' performance in disease diagnosis, which will broadly benefit public health.          n/a",Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment,7298516,K99EB007620,"['Area', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical assessment', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'statistics']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2007,88539,-0.010361241357808788
"Toward Quantitative Disease Assessment from Capsule Endoscopy Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Capsule endoscopy has recently emerged as a valuable imaging technology for the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially the small bowel and the esophagus. With this technology, it has become possible to directly evaluate the gut mucosa of patients with a variety of conditions, such as obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, celiac disease and Crohn's disease. Although the use of capsule endoscopy is gaining rapidly, the evaluation of capsule endoscopic imagery presents numerous practical challenges. In a typical case, the capsule acquires 50,000 or more images over an eight-hour period. The quality of these images is highly variable due to the uncontrolled motion of the capsule itself as it moves through the GI tract, the complexity of the structures being imaged, and inherent limitations of the imager itself. In practice, relatively few (often less than 100) of these images contain significant diagnostic content. As a result, it is challenging to create an effective, repeatable means for evaluating capsule endoscopic sequences. The goal of this project is create a tool for semi-automated, objective, quantitative assessment of pathologic findings in capsule endoscopic data. The clinical focus will be on quantitative assessment of lesions that appear in Crohn's disease of the small bowel. The technical approach to this problem will make use of statistical learning methods to create algorithms that perform lesion classification and assessment in a manner consistent with a trained expert. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that appropriately constructed algorithms will be able to perform assessment of lesions appearing in capsule endoscopic images with a level of consistency comparable to human observers. In proving this hypothesis, the proposed project will pursue the following three specific aims:       Aim 1: Data acquisition. To develop a substantial database of images of intestinal lesions together with an expert assessment of several attributes indicative of lesion severity.       Aim 2: Tissue classification and image enhancement. To develop algorithms for low-level classification of tissue type from image content using statistical learning techniques, and to create algorithms for registering multiple partial views of a lesion to create more complete views.       Aim 3: Automated Lesion Assessment. To apply and validate statistical learning methods that can assess the images produced by Aim 2 in a manner consistent with the expert assessments compiled in Aim 1.       The focus of this R21 is on the development of tools that have proven efficacy on a representative corpus of data. This will set the stage for subsequent technological developments leading toward the automated detection of lesions, and subsequent clinical studies addressing the development of quantitative measures for Crohn's disease severity in a more substantial clinical setting.          n/a",Toward Quantitative Disease Assessment from Capsule Endoscopy Images,7362843,R21EB008227,"['Address', 'Aggressive Clinical Course', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Celiac Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Condition', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Eating', 'End Point', 'Endoscopy', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Healed', 'Hemorrhage', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Intestines', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ulcer', 'base', 'capsule', 'data acquisition', 'gastrointestinal', 'healing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'size', 'small bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,235138,0.0015566007803098389
"Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to tackle the problem of way finding (finding one's way in an environment), faced by blind and severely visually impaired persons who are unable to find or read signs, landmarks and locations. We propose a novel and very inexpensive environmental labeling system to provide this population with access to information needed for indoor way finding (where GPS is not available). The system uses simple passive landmark symbols printed on paper or other material, placed next to text, Braille signs or barcode at locations of interest (offices, bathrooms, etc.) in an environment such as an office building. These printed patterns contain spatial and semantic information that is detected using computer vision algorithms running on a standard camera cell phone. By scanning the environment with the device, which detects all landmark symbols in its line of sight up to distances of 10 meters, the user can determine his or her approximate location in the environment as well as the information encoded near each landmark symbol. The system extracts this information in real-time and communicates it to the user by sound, synthesized speech and/or tactile feedback. This information includes spatial (e.g. audio tones to indicate the presence and direction of a label in the camera's field of view) and semantic information (""Mr. Johnson's office, room 429, at 11 o'clock"").

"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7264516,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Numbers', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'day', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2007,387827,-0.02302941533277198

"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR) Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra. The proposed protocol will incorporate three discrete phases: 1) technology development, integration, and testing; 2) validity testing with a controlled diet (metabolic ward study); and 3) real-world utility testing. Validity of the data collected will be judged by how closely the nutrient calculations match the known composition of the metabolic ward diets consumed.

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,7253351,U24RR021382,[' '],NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSP,U24,2007,5123449,0.0008769399034604337
"Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma diagnosis, management and research depend on complex judgments of the optic disc (or optic nerve head), visual field and intraocular pressure. The current standard of optic disc evaluation requires qualitative observer judgments of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc, a less than optimal method. Despite much research, no methods have yet conclusively improved over this conventional Approach: Contemporary optic disc analyzers typically use instrument-specific image capture methods and derive quantitative estimates for various anatomical features of the optic disc. Our goal is to improve the methods of optic disc diagnosis by applying advanced image analysis methods from computer engineering to the essential diagnostic problem in glaucoma - detecting change or stability in optic disc images over time. Expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in clinical glaucoma, translational research (R. Stone, PI; E. Miller, J. Piltz-Seymour and others) and biostatistics (M. Maguire, G.-S. Ying) is merged with engineering expertise in computer image analysis at Sarnoff Corporation (B. Hanna, H. Sawhney, and others) in a Bioengineering Research Partnership with four Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate robust registration algorithms for automatic alignment of optic disc images; 2) Develop an automated multiple-view analysis approach to extract relative, local change parameters from optic disc stereo images; 3) Develop interactive tools to assist in observer grading of optic disc images and in clinical interpretation of the automated change detection and stereoscopic algorithms; and 4) Conduct initial validation studies of the optic disc change detection tools. Our plan to address stereo primarily differs from other approaches to optic nerve analysis, but it offers many advantages for validation, clinical care and research not possible with the instrument-specific formats of contemporary fundus analyzers. Requiring only a personal computer and software to analyze optic disc images, our approach is clinically intuitive, can accommodate improvements in software and camera technology, is compatible with many image formats, permits use of archived fundus photos and is cost-effective. The refined approach to stereo recovery will permit robust detection of optic disc stability or change, and it offers great promise for advancing optic nerve diagnosis in glaucoma.          n/a",Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma,7289973,R01EY017299,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Calculi', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Compatible', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fundus', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Numbers', 'Optic Atrophy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'day', 'digital imaging', 'image registration', 'improved', 'instrument', 'novel diagnostics', 'programs', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2007,853883,0.004799126559423461
"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions. Optimization screens would be improved by applying Case-Based and Bayesian methods here as well as by further developments of automated image analysis. III.

"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data.

"Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to tackle the problem of way finding (finding one's way in an environment), faced by blind and severely visually impaired persons who are unable to find or read signs, landmarks and locations. We propose a novel and very inexpensive environmental labeling system to provide this population with access to information needed for indoor way finding (where GPS is not available). The system uses simple passive landmark symbols printed on paper or other material, placed next to text, Braille signs or barcode at locations of interest (offices, bathrooms, etc.) in an environment such as an office building. These printed patterns contain spatial and semantic information that is detected using computer vision algorithms running on a standard camera cell phone. By scanning the environment with the device, which detects all landmark symbols in its line of sight up to distances of 10 meters, the user can determine his or her approximate location in the environment as well as the information encoded near each landmark symbol. The system extracts this information in real-time and communicates it to the user by sound, synthesized speech and/or tactile feedback. This information includes spatial (e.g. audio tones to indicate the presence and direction of a label in the camera's field of view) and semantic information (""Mr. Johnson's office, room 429, at 11 o'clock""). The research proposed here will produce a prototype system that will be tested by blind and low vision subjects.

"Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmentation of detailed, patient-specific models from medical imagery can provide invaluable assistance for surgical planning and navigation. Current segmentation methods often make errors when confronted with subtle intensity boundaries. Adding knowledge of expected shape of a structure, and the range of normal variations in shape, can greatly improve segmentation, by guiding it towards the most likely shape consistent with the image information. The resulting segmentations can be used to plan surgical procedures, and when registered to the patient, can provide navigational guidance around critical structures. Many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and Fetal Growth Restriction, affect the shape of specific anatomical areas. To understand the development and progression of these diseases, as well as to develop methods for classifying instances into diseased or normal classes, 1 needs methods that capture differences in shape distributions between populations. Our goal is to develop and validate methods for learning from images concise representations of anatomical shape and its variability, Modeling shape distributions will improve segmentation algorithms by biasing the search towards more likely shapes. It will also enable quantitative analysis based on shape in population studies, where imaging is used to study differences in anatomy between populations, as well as changes within a population, for example with age. The proposed research builds on prior methods for segmentation and shape analysis, using tools from computer vision and machine learning applied to questions of shape representation, shape based segmentation and shape analysis for population studies. We plan to further develop the methods and to validate them with our collaborators in several different applications, including surgical planning, neonatal imaging and image-based studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease.            n/a",Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions,7015019,R01NS051826,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain morphology', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image guided surgery /therapy', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'mathematical model', 'prenatal growth disorder']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2006,289590,-0.0026708881959379934
"Simulation Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This SBIR project is developing methods and software for the specification, construction and simulation of neutral spatial models, and for applying these neutral models within the framework of probabilistic pattern recognition. Results will allow epidemiologists, environmental scientists and image analysts across a broad range of commercial disciplines to more accurately identify patterns in spatial data by removing the bias towards false positives that is caused by unrealistic null hypotheses such as ""complete spatial randomness"" (CSR). This project will accomplish 5 aims:      1. Conduct a requirements analysis to specify the neutral models and functionality to incorporate in the software.   2. Develop and test a software prototype to evaluate feasibility of the proposed models.   3. Propose a topology of neutral models and develop strategies to generate them and to conduct sensitivity analysis for investigating the impact of implicit assumptions (i.e. spatial autocorrelation or non-uniform risk) and number of realizations on test results.   4. Incorporate the neutral models in the first commercially established software package that allows for user-specified alternate hypothesis in spatial statistical tests.   5. Apply the software and methods to demonstrate the approach and its unique benefits for exposure and health risk assessment.      Feasibility of this project was demonstrated in the Phase I. This Phase II project will accomplish aims three through five. These technologic, scientific and commercial innovations will revolutionize our ability to identify, document and assess the probability of spatial patterns relative to neutral models that incorporate realistic local, spatial and multivariate dependencies. The neutral models and methods in this proposal make possible, for the first time ever, evaluation of the sensitivity of the results of cluster or boundary analyses to specification of the null hypothesis.         n/a",Simulation Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Recognition,7015648,R44CA092807,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'human data', 'image processing', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'statistics /biometry', 'visual cortex']",NCI,BIOMEDWARE,R44,2006,500182,-0.004533069243642647
"Spatial Modeling in Glaucoma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career training proposal is to train Michael D. Twa, OD, MS as an independent clinician-scientist. A five year training program is proposed, consisting of formal coursework in vision science, specific training in computer science and image processing, and mentoring in the application of these skills to clinical outcomes research in glaucoma. In September 2003, NIH announced a new ""Roadmap"" to accelerate advances in biomedical research for the 21st century. Three areas listed in this Roadmap are relevant to this research proposal: (1) Interdisciplinary research training. (2) Clinical research informatics. (3) Development of enabling technologies for improved assessment of clinical outcomes. The Roadmap emphasizes coordinated strategies to develop both technological and human resources to take full advantage of multidisciplinary and translational research opportunities. This proposal addresses the stated training objectives at an individual level.  Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Visual field assessment and optic nerve head imaging (confocal scanning laser tomography) are commonly used to diagnose the disease and monitor its progression, yet there is considerable controversy about how to interpret and make best use of this information. Currently, raw data from these observations are reduced to statistical indices that are meant to summarize clinically meaningful features and provide a basis for classifying test results as normal or not. Unfortunately, these indices may sacrifice other relevant features in the data for interpretability.  We will use mathematical modeling methods (polynomial modeling, spline fitting and wavelet analysis) to quantify patterns in visual field data and topographic images of the optic nerve head. We will use features derived from these modeling methods to apply novel pattern recognition techniques from computer and information sciences-decision trees and non-linear regression analysis-and then compare these techniques to current methods to identify glaucoma. By improving current methods of analysis we can provide a more quantitative basis for clinical decisions, and offer greater consistency and objectivity on data interpretation. The long-term objective of this proposal is to translate advances in computer and information sciences to the analysis of clinical outcomes research in glaucoma and other eye diseases. n/a",Spatial Modeling in Glaucoma,7015012,K23EY016225,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'glaucoma', 'glaucoma test', 'human data', 'image processing', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neuroimaging', 'optic nerve', 'patient oriented research', 'tomography', 'visual fields']",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K23,2006,142642,-0.024738866454540466
"Vortex Tubed Thermocycler with Intelligent Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel system is proposed for the rapid identification of DNA. The system comprises of a unique thermocycler platform built around the extraordinary vortex tube, detection optics, intelligent software to provide users with information on most ideal operating conditions, and virtual insight into the PCR process as it progresses. An intelligent user interface will allow DNA amplification/detection on an unprecedented timescale (less than 10 minutes). A multi-disciplinary team that consists of a chemical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and two biochemists has been assembled for this project. The efficiency of the vortex tube will be optimized by the use of computational fluid dynamics. Heat transfer between the gas phase and the cuvets will be improved through computational fluid dynamic calculations. The intelligent software consists of a detailed mathematical model that uses similar starting conditions as the initial cuvet composition to model the amplification progress and it performs a virtual PCR in parallel with the actual process. The virtual PCR will become a quantitative tool point-of-care diagnosis of a wide variety of heritable and infectious diseases.

"Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to explore, develop and test computer vision algorithms to analyze images of street intersections from a camera worn by a blind person.  Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel.  They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult.  We will explore computer vision algorithms to help a blind person find the crosswalk, find the pedestrian signal button, determine when the ""walk"" light is on, and alert him/her to any veering out of the crosswalk.  We will emphasize the development of completely novel methods of analyzing non-ideal images including shadows, occlusions and other irregularities using spatial grouping techniques based on Bayesian inference.  The resulting algorithms are intended for eventual integration as modules for a computer vision system we are already developing to help blind persons with travel tasks such as finding and reading aloud printed signs and negotiating street crossings.  The combined system would have potential for a radical advance in independent travel for blind persons.  In this exploratory project, we aim to: (1) Explore and test alternative approaches to algorithm design to process intersection images and extract the information about the crosswalk, crossing signal, etc., using a database of real-world images taken by blind persons at a variety of different kinds of intersections.  (2) Test the algorithms using a portable camera connected to a notebook computer with speech output. n/a",Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind,7096566,R21EY015187,"['blind aid', 'blindness', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'gait', 'human subject', 'injury prevention', 'mathematical model', 'statistics /biometry', 'transportation /recreation safety', 'urban area']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2006,214738,0.009423131946507105
"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

"National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC) is a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, software engineers, and medical investigators who develop computational tools for the analysis and visualization of medical image data. The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state-of-the-art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed, open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neuroscience and neurological disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. The overall analysis will occur at a range of scales, and will occur across a range of modalities including diffusion MRI, quantitative EGG, and metabolic and receptor PET, but potentially including microscopic, genomic, and other image data. It will apply to image data from individual patients, and to studies executed across large populations. The data will be taken from subjects across a wide range of time scales and ultimately apply to a broad range of diseases in a broad range of organs.             n/a",National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI),7104243,U54EB005149,"['NIH Roadmap Initiative tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cooperative study']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2006,3809481,-0.0013808490969168768
"Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cochlea is a remarkable sensor: a living cochlea can reliably detect sounds that cause motions of the stapes on the order of picometers, is capable of high-quality frequency analysis (Q10dB > 600), and compresses the large dynamic range (120 dB) of hearing into the considerably smaller dynamic range (20- 50 dB) of neurons. It is now widely accepted that an active mechanical amplification process underlies these remarkable properties. However, there is considerable debate about the nature of the amplifier. While information on the cellular and molecular basis of hearing is increasing rapidly, there is still little understanding of how the components interoperate to generate the remarkable properties of hearing.       To date, the most successful experimental studies of cellular motions in living cochleae have used optical methods. However, current methods, such as laser Doppler vibrometry and video microscopy are limited by the low reflectivities of cochlear structures and the limited optical access provided by the intact cochea. The objective of this grant is to develop and apply a new tomographic imaging and motion measurement technique capable of determining the three-dimensional motions of all structures in a living, intact cochlea. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to obtain high-resolution images of the cochlea. Images will be acquired through a narrow opening similar to that used in laser Doppler vibrometry methods, or possibly directly through bone. Sequences of stroboscopic images will be generated with synchronous demodulation of the OCT detector signal during acoustic stimulation. Computer vision algorithms (similar to those used in video microscopy methods) will be used to determine motions with nanometer resolution. This technique will be applied to image and measure three-dimensional motions of the internal microstructure of an intact cochlea, including the basilar membrane, reticular lamina, tectorial membrane, and outer hair cells. n/a",Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions,6985366,R21DC007111,"['animal tissue', 'auditory stimulus', 'biomechanics', 'cochlea', 'computer program /software', 'ear hair cell', 'guinea pigs', 'image processing', 'measurement', 'neuroimaging', 'optical tomography', 'organ of Corti', 'retina', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'vibration', 'video microscopy']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2006,183324,0.015329157646471032
"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,7078667,U24RR021382,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cooperative study', 'data management', 'human subject', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'method development', 'molecular biology information system', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychology']",NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2006,5010926,0.0008769399034604337
"MobileEye OCR for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this SBIR we propose to demonstrate the technical feasibility of Mobile OCR, a portable software system which makes use of existing personal devices to provide access to textual materials for the elderly or the visually impaired. The system will help these low vision individuals with basic daily activities, such as shopping, preparing meals, taking medication, and reading traffic signs. It will step beyond our proposed MobileEyes vision enhancement system to apply cutting edge recognition technology for mobile devices. The system will use common camera phone hardware to capture and enhance textual information, perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and provide audio or visual feedback. Our research will focus on implementing and integrating new vision enhancement and analysis techniques on limited resource mobile devices. Specifically, we will develop algorithms for detection and rectification of text on planes and generalized cylinders subject to perspective distortions, implement more robust and efficient algorithms and systems for stabilization and enhancement of text blocks, provide mobile OCR on complex textured backgrounds, and implement these techniques on small devices across a variety of platforms. The recognized text will be presented through Text-to-Speech (TTS), or displayed on the device with enhanced quality which can be easily read by low vision users. Phase I will focus on demonstrating the technical feasibility of our approach, and will incorporate a performance measurement methodology to quantitatively evaluate progress and evaluate our system against other approaches. In comparison to existing vision enhancement devices, such as magnifying glasses, telescopes, and text reading devices such as scanner-based OCR, our solution has several advantages: 1) it makes use of a single, portable device (camera cell phone) that is commonly available and typically already carried for its telecommunications capabilities; 2) it can be used selectively by users so they will not be overwhelmed by irrelevant information; and 3) it can be integrated directly with other applications for specialized tasks. Our research results will impact the millions of low-vision individuals and the blind, as well as vision and computer vision researchers. Our team is uniquely qualified to explore the feasibility of extending visual applications to these devices, and provide a platform for integrating future vision algorithms.         n/a",MobileEye OCR for the Visually Impaired,7053650,R43EY017216,"['reading', 'solutions', 'vision']",NEI,"APPLIED MEDIA ANALYSIS, LLC",R43,2006,104935,-0.032642148923821286
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7125565,R01EB006200,"['NIH Roadmap Initiative tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biotechnology', 'charge coupled device camera', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'high throughput technology', 'image enhancement', 'robotics']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2006,399410,-0.02302941533277198
"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantum has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the first artificial intelligence (Al) tutoring systems in chemistry education. This work successfully addressed several longstanding, clearly articulated needs for improved interactive educational software. A leading distributor for the U.S. and Canada, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories, as well as prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, have entered into long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. The aim of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to bring the full power and benefits of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired. There is a considerable need for improved educational software for science education in general, but the problem of quality educational software materials for the blind is known to be particularly acute. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum Al Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind using Internet-capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation here is the development of advanced Al tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the first Al tutoring systems that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. A formulation of an Al tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. This project can only be accomplished by working intimately with experts in education for the blind, and Quantum has arranged a number of important partnerships in this respect, for research as well as commercialization of the resulting technology, including: the National Federation of the Blind, the American Printing House for the Blind, Pearson Learning Group, Bartimaeus Group and Henter Mathematics. n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software,6880607,R43EY016251,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'blind aid', 'chemistry', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'educational resource design /development', 'science education', 'technology /technique development']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2005,100721,-0.017181124351113308
"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions. Optimization screens would be improved by applying Case-Based and Bayesian methods here as well as by further developments of automated image analysis. III.

"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data.

"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to test the feasibility of a ""Smart Telescope"" for use to improve the ability of visually impaired persons in tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. Advances in low-power high-speed portable computers combined with novel computer vision algorithms enable us to build an affordable, portable, and cosmetically acceptable digital telescope that can enable visually impaired persons to perform these tasks with greater ease than with current telescopes.        The computer vision algorithms first detect regions of interest in an image where targets are likely to be, even if these targets occupy only a small portion of the visual field, obviating the need for a user to scan or search a scene as would be necessary with an ordinary telescope. Next, novel object-specific super-resolution enhancement algorithms use target-specific knowledge to magnify and enhance these regions so that users can interpret them, similar to pointing a telescope at those regions. Algorithms can then track the targets as the observer moves, and indicate their relative locations. Finally, like today's digital telescopes for   the low vision community, the Smart Telescope will output either to a monocular viewfinder display or to a bioptic display.      The project process involves: (1) Data collection and analysis (Iow-vision persons will be used to collect image data); (2) Detection, enhancement and tracking algorithm development; (3) Integration of algorithms with user interface, and (4) Testing human factors.      Our field prototypes will range in cost from approximately $3,000 to $5,000 each, while the target cost of a commercial version is under $1,000. Our price estimates are conservative, and we anticipate that the rapid development of computer technology will lower these costs substantially in the next few years.         n/a",A Smart Telescope for Low Vision,6995047,R43EY014487,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection', 'digital imaging', 'functional ability', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'patient oriented research', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'questionnaires', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders', 'visual fields', 'visual perception', 'visual threshold', 'visual tracking']",NEI,BLINDSIGHT CORPORATION,R43,2005,144106,0.0038835372179374787
"Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmentation of detailed, patient-specific models from medical imagery can provide invaluable assistance for surgical planning and navigation. Current segmentation methods often make errors when confronted with subtle intensity boundaries. Adding knowledge of expected shape of a structure, and the range of normal variations in shape, can greatly improve segmentation, by guiding it towards the most likely shape consistent with the image information. The resulting segmentations can be used to plan surgical procedures, and when registered to the patient, can provide navigational guidance around critical structures. Many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and Fetal Growth Restriction, affect the shape of specific anatomical areas. To understand the development and progression of these diseases, as well as to develop methods for classifying instances into diseased or normal classes, 1 needs methods that capture differences in shape distributions between populations. Our goal is to develop and validate methods for learning from images concise representations of anatomical shape and its variability, Modeling shape distributions will improve segmentation algorithms by biasing the search towards more likely shapes. It will also enable quantitative analysis based on shape in population studies, where imaging is used to study differences in anatomy between populations, as well as changes within a population, for example with age. The proposed research builds on prior methods for segmentation and shape analysis, using tools from computer vision and machine learning applied to questions of shape representation, shape based segmentation and shape analysis for population studies. We plan to further develop the methods and to validate them with our collaborators in several different applications, including surgical planning, neonatal imaging and image-based studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease.            n/a",Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions,6916728,R01NS051826,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain morphology', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image guided surgery /therapy', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'mathematical model', 'prenatal growth disorder']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2005,292728,-0.0026708881959379934
"Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):                                                 The Applied Imagery, Pattern Recognition (AIPR) Workshop is held annually in         Washington, D.C., at the Cosmos Club.  This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.  A five-year period of         support is requested, to enable the meeting to grow in participation and             breadth of disciplines attracted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              n/a",Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop,6944025,R13CA093819,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer human interaction', 'videotape /videodisc', 'workshop']",NCI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R13,2005,5000,0.00747743382845854
"Simulation Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This SBIR project is developing methods and software for the specification, construction and simulation of neutral spatial models, and for applying these neutral models within the framework of probabilistic pattern recognition. Results will allow epidemiologists, environmental scientists and image analysts across a broad range of commercial disciplines to more accurately identify patterns in spatial data by removing the bias towards false positives that is caused by unrealistic null hypotheses such as ""complete spatial randomness"" (CSR). This project will accomplish 5 aims:      1. Conduct a requirements analysis to specify the neutral models and functionality to incorporate in the software.   2. Develop and test a software prototype to evaluate feasibility of the proposed models.   3. Propose a topology of neutral models and develop strategies to generate them and to conduct sensitivity analysis for investigating the impact of implicit assumptions (i.e. spatial autocorrelation or non-uniform risk) and number of realizations on test results.   4. Incorporate the neutral models in the first commercially established software package that allows for user-specified alternate hypothesis in spatial statistical tests.   5. Apply the software and methods to demonstrate the approach and its unique benefits for exposure and health risk assessment.      Feasibility of this project was demonstrated in the Phase I. This Phase II project will accomplish aims three through five. These technologic, scientific and commercial innovations will revolutionize our ability to identify, document and assess the probability of spatial patterns relative to neutral models that incorporate realistic local, spatial and multivariate dependencies. The neutral models and methods in this proposal make possible, for the first time ever, evaluation of the sensitivity of the results of cluster or boundary analyses to specification of the null hypothesis.         n/a",Simulation Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Recognition,6863029,R44CA092807,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'human data', 'image processing', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'statistics /biometry', 'visual cortex']",NCI,BIOMEDWARE,R44,2005,498368,-0.004533069243642647
"Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will further develop and refine an innovative digital auto-focus technology for automated microscopy. Auto-focusing is essential to automated microscope imaging. Currently available techniques rely on various algorithms of focus computation at a single image resolution and suffer from inherent performance limitations, which affect their success and utilization in clinical and research applications. Auto-focusing for fluorescence microscopy, for example, represents a serious challenge to existing methods for desired accuracy, reliability and speed since in this case the images have very low signal-to-noise ratio and narrow depth-of-fields while specimen exposure to fluorescent excitation must be minimized to avoid photo-bleaching and formation of undesirable substances such as free radicals and singlet oxygen. We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to microscope auto-focusing, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform. The new approach overcomes a number of inherent limitations of currently available techniques, and holds the promise to make the measurement of the microscope focus function and the detection of best-focus imaging position considerably more accurate, reliable, and fast. This innovative technology will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated microscope instruments for a wide range of clinical and research applications where a large number of specimens need to be imaged and quantitatively analyzed on a routine basis. During the Phase 1 project we investigated the feasibility of the proposed technology for fluorescence microscopy. We developed software to implement the algorithms for multi-resolution focus function measurements and for in-focus imaging position search. We evaluated the new approach in software simulation on a variety of sample image stacks of cytogenetic FISH specimens, and compared it with all current best-performing methods for microscope auto-focusing using the criteria of (1) accuracy, (2) range, (3) robustness, and (4) speed. The Phase 1 results suggest that, by using a proper wavelet-based auto-focus function, the new multi-resolution method significantly outperforms all competing methods in each of the aforementioned performance categories, and clearly exceeds the Phase 1 feasibility criteria. In the Phase 2 project, we will further develop, refine, integrate, and validate the new technology in real-time operation environment. We plan to build a prototype system with multi-resolution auto-focusing capabilities for both fluorescence and bright-field microscope imaging. We will evaluate the system extensively for a variety of applications including genetics, pathology, and cytology. We will beta test the new system and technology in routine clinical laboratory environment and optimize the technology as end user input and feedbacks are gathered. Once fully developed and qualified, this new technology will be patented and incorporated into future IRIS automated imaging cytometry instruments. It will also be made commercially available to Applied Imaging Corporation and other manufacturers of automated microscope instruments through licensing agreements and partnerships.           n/a",Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy,6951446,R44RR016817,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'flow cytometry', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent in situ hybridization', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'mathematical model']",NCRR,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R44,2005,318350,0.02639513667290599
"Spatial Modeling in Glaucoma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career training proposal is to train Michael D. Twa, OD, MS as an independent clinician-scientist. A five year training program is proposed, consisting of formal coursework in vision science, specific training in computer science and image processing, and mentoring in the application of these skills to clinical outcomes research in glaucoma. In September 2003, NIH announced a new ""Roadmap"" to accelerate advances in biomedical research for the 21st century. Three areas listed in this Roadmap are relevant to this research proposal: (1) Interdisciplinary research training. (2) Clinical research informatics. (3) Development of enabling technologies for improved assessment of clinical outcomes. The Roadmap emphasizes coordinated strategies to develop both technological and human resources to take full advantage of multidisciplinary and translational research opportunities. This proposal addresses the stated training objectives at an individual level.  Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Visual field assessment and optic nerve head imaging (confocal scanning laser tomography) are commonly used to diagnose the disease and monitor its progression, yet there is considerable controversy about how to interpret and make best use of this information. Currently, raw data from these observations are reduced to statistical indices that are meant to summarize clinically meaningful features and provide a basis for classifying test results as normal or not. Unfortunately, these indices may sacrifice other relevant features in the data for interpretability.  We will use mathematical modeling methods (polynomial modeling, spline fitting and wavelet analysis) to quantify patterns in visual field data and topographic images of the optic nerve head. We will use features derived from these modeling methods to apply novel pattern recognition techniques from computer and information sciences-decision trees and non-linear regression analysis-and then compare these techniques to current methods to identify glaucoma. By improving current methods of analysis we can provide a more quantitative basis for clinical decisions, and offer greater consistency and objectivity on data interpretation. The long-term objective of this proposal is to translate advances in computer and information sciences to the analysis of clinical outcomes research in glaucoma and other eye diseases. n/a",Spatial Modeling in Glaucoma,6863529,K23EY016225,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'glaucoma', 'glaucoma test', 'human data', 'image processing', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neuroimaging', 'optic nerve', 'patient oriented research', 'tomography', 'visual fields']",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K23,2005,143096,-0.024738866454540466
"Vortex Tubed Thermocycler with Intelligent Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel system is proposed for the rapid identification of DNA. The system comprises of a unique thermocycler platform built around the extraordinary vortex tube, detection optics, intelligent software to provide users with information on most ideal operating conditions, and virtual insight into the PCR process as it progresses. An intelligent user interface will allow DNA amplification/detection on an unprecedented timescale (less than 10 minutes). A multi-disciplinary team that consists of a chemical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and two biochemists has been assembled for this project. The efficiency of the vortex tube will be optimized by the use of computational fluid dynamics. Heat transfer between the gas phase and the cuvets will be improved through computational fluid dynamic calculations. The intelligent software consists of a detailed mathematical model that uses similar starting conditions as the initial cuvet composition to model the amplification progress and it performs a virtual PCR in parallel with the actual process. The virtual PCR will become a quantitative tool point-of-care diagnosis of a wide variety of heritable and infectious diseases.

"Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The goal of the research proposed herein is to develop a low-cost, user-friendly, computer-based imaging system for use by women to reduce anxiety and distress relating to alopecia (hair loss) prior to or following chemotherapy. It has been reported that 47 percent to 58 percent of women with cancer cite the likelihood of alopecia as the most disturbing anticipated aspect of receiving chemotherapy; 8 percent stated that they seriously considered refusing treatment due to this possibility. Utilizing advanced graphical processing techniques, the proposed ""Help for Alopecia through Image Representations"" (HAIR) system will permit cancer patients of all races and ethnicities to interactively visualize, using their own image, the process of hair loss, accessorization options (e.g., wigs, head scarves, hats, etc.), and the corresponding stages of hair regrowth. ""Scripting"" (i.e., rehearsing) the side effects of chemotherapy and potential patient responses will significantly reduce the anxiety caused by the prospect of alopecia. This will serve to desensitize women to alopecia, allow them to make better informed treatment decisions, and facilitate coping when it occurs.            n/a",Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress,6935840,R44CA099873,"['Internet', 'alopecia', 'anxiety', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'coping', 'desensitization psychotherapy', 'drug adverse effect', 'female', 'human subject', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'neoplasm /cancer chemotherapy', 'patient oriented research', 'psychological aspect of cancer', 'quality of life', 'women&apos', 's health']",NCI,"BARRON ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2005,399984,-0.019541539649792803
"Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to explore, develop and test computer vision algorithms to analyze images of street intersections from a camera worn by a blind person.  Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel.  They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult.  We will explore computer vision algorithms to help a blind person find the crosswalk, find the pedestrian signal button, determine when the ""walk"" light is on, and alert him/her to any veering out of the crosswalk.  We will emphasize the development of completely novel methods of analyzing non-ideal images including shadows, occlusions and other irregularities using spatial grouping techniques based on Bayesian inference.  The resulting algorithms are intended for eventual integration as modules for a computer vision system we are already developing to help blind persons with travel tasks such as finding and reading aloud printed signs and negotiating street crossings.  The combined system would have potential for a radical advance in independent travel for blind persons.  In this exploratory project, we aim to: (1) Explore and test alternative approaches to algorithm design to process intersection images and extract the information about the crosswalk, crossing signal, etc., using a database of real-world images taken by blind persons at a variety of different kinds of intersections.  (2) Test the algorithms using a portable camera connected to a notebook computer with speech output. n/a",Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind,6920594,R21EY015187,"['blind aid', 'blindness', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'gait', 'human subject', 'injury prevention', 'mathematical model', 'statistics /biometry', 'transportation /recreation safety', 'urban area']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2005,255198,0.009423131946507105
"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state-of-the-art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed, open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neuroscience and neurological disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. The overall analysis will occur at a range of scales, and will occur across a range of modalities including diffusion MRI, quantitative EGG, and metabolic and receptor PET, but potentially including microscopic, genomic, and other image data.

"Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cochlea is a remarkable sensor: a living cochlea can reliably detect sounds that cause motions of the stapes on the order of picometers, is capable of high-quality frequency analysis (Q10dB > 600), and compresses the large dynamic range (120 dB) of hearing into the considerably smaller dynamic range (20- 50 dB) of neurons. It is now widely accepted that an active mechanical amplification process underlies these remarkable properties. However, there is considerable debate about the nature of the amplifier. While information on the cellular and molecular basis of hearing is increasing rapidly, there is still little understanding of how the components interoperate to generate the remarkable properties of hearing.       To date, the most successful experimental studies of cellular motions in living cochleae have used optical methods. However, current methods, such as laser Doppler vibrometry and video microscopy are limited by the low reflectivities of cochlear structures and the limited optical access provided by the intact cochea. The objective of this grant is to develop and apply a new tomographic imaging and motion measurement technique capable of determining the three-dimensional motions of all structures in a living, intact cochlea. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to obtain high-resolution images of the cochlea. Images will be acquired through a narrow opening similar to that used in laser Doppler vibrometry methods, or possibly directly through bone. Sequences of stroboscopic images will be generated with synchronous demodulation of the OCT detector signal during acoustic stimulation. Computer vision algorithms (similar to those used in video microscopy methods) will be used to determine motions with nanometer resolution. This technique will be applied to image and measure three-dimensional motions of the internal microstructure of an intact cochlea, including the basilar membrane, reticular lamina, tectorial membrane, and outer hair cells. n/a",Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions,6850297,R21DC007111,"['animal tissue', 'auditory stimulus', 'biomechanics', 'cochlea', 'computer program /software', 'ear hair cell', 'guinea pigs', 'image processing', 'measurement', 'neuroimaging', 'optical tomography', 'organ of Corti', 'retina', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'vibration', 'video microscopy']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2005,172385,0.015329157646471032
"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,6952714,U24RR021382,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cooperative study', 'data management', 'human subject', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'method development', 'molecular biology information system', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychology']",NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2005,5013536,0.0008769399034604337
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7012638,R01EB006200,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biotechnology', 'charge coupled device camera', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'high throughput technology', 'image enhancement', 'robotics']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2005,363523,-0.02302941533277198
"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1.

Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base.

Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11.

This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.

"3D Telestration for Robotically Assisted Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The speed with which an innovative and improved surgical procedure can be widely adopted is governed principally by the availability of competent surgeon mentors. With its difficult learning curve, minimally invasive surgery has an especially strong need for mentors. Several investigators have developed ""telestration,"" the ability for a remote surgeon mentor to draw on the operating surgeon's video display, to make surgical mentoring available over long distances to increase the availability of mentors. Robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery such as that practiced with the da Vinci surgical robot has the same basic need for mentors, with two special circumstances that amplify the need for mentors: robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery is in its earlier stages, with few qualified mentors, and due to the surgeon's immersion at a control console with a high-fidelity 3D display, a mentor is in a sense ""remote"" even if he or she is in the same room. Both of these special circumstances make telestration even more attractive for robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery than it is for conventional minimally invasive surgery.      The proposed project would meet this challenge by leveraging another aspect of the surgical robot system - the presence of computational power- to apply image correlation algorithms to render 3D telestration drawings from drawings produced in 2D by the mentor. The same image correlation algorithms used to generate the 3D telestration also offer a second major benefit - the ability to virtually ""paint"" the telestration drawings on the anatomy in the surgeon's 3D view, so that the markings made by the mentor move with the anatomy, appearing to have been made with a paint pen directly on the tissue. In addition to the two immediate benefits of generating 3D telestration and creating drawings that track anatomy, application of these algorithms has broad potential impact in the area of image-guided surgery. n/a",3D Telestration for Robotically Assisted Surgery,6831980,R41EB004177,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'image guided surgery /therapy', 'robotics', 'swine', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography']",NIBIB,"INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.",R41,2004,105941,0.006808942099033665
"Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will further develop and refine an innovative digital auto-focus technology for automated microscopy. Auto-focusing is essential to automated microscope imaging. Currently available techniques rely on various algorithms of focus computation at a single image resolution and suffer from inherent performance limitations, which affect their success and utilization in clinical and research applications. Auto-focusing for fluorescence microscopy, for example, represents a serious challenge to existing methods for desired accuracy, reliability and speed since in this case the images have very low signal-to-noise ratio and narrow depth-of-fields while specimen exposure to fluorescent excitation must be minimized to avoid photo-bleaching and formation of undesirable substances such as free radicals and singlet oxygen. We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to microscope auto-focusing, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform. The new approach overcomes a number of inherent limitations of currently available techniques, and holds the promise to make the measurement of the microscope focus function and the detection of best-focus imaging position considerably more accurate, reliable, and fast. This innovative technology will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated microscope instruments for a wide range of clinical and research applications where a large number of specimens need to be imaged and quantitatively analyzed on a routine basis. During the Phase 1 project we investigated the feasibility of the proposed technology for fluorescence microscopy. We developed software to implement the algorithms for multi-resolution focus function measurements and for in-focus imaging position search. We evaluated the new approach in software simulation on a variety of sample image stacks of cytogenetic FISH specimens, and compared it with all current best-performing methods for microscope auto-focusing using the criteria of (1) accuracy, (2) range, (3) robustness, and (4) speed. The Phase 1 results suggest that, by using a proper wavelet-based auto-focus function, the new multi-resolution method significantly outperforms all competing methods in each of the aforementioned performance categories, and clearly exceeds the Phase 1 feasibility criteria. In the Phase 2 project, we will further develop, refine, integrate, and validate the new technology in real-time operation environment. We plan to build a prototype system with multi-resolution auto-focusing capabilities for both fluorescence and bright-field microscope imaging. We will evaluate the system extensively for a variety of applications including genetics, pathology, and cytology. We will beta test the new system and technology in routine clinical laboratory environment and optimize the technology as end user input and feedbacks are gathered. Once fully developed and qualified, this new technology will be patented and incorporated into future IRIS automated imaging cytometry instruments. It will also be made commercially available to Applied Imaging Corporation and other manufacturers of automated microscope instruments through licensing agreements and partnerships.           n/a",Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy,6833120,R44RR016817,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'flow cytometry', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent in situ hybridization', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'mathematical model']",NCRR,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R44,2004,427818,0.02639513667290599
"Optimized Retinal Camera DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A low-cost, high-resolution, high-contrast color digital camera optimized for ophthalmology will be demonstrated. This Optimized Retinal Camera will be specifically tested for its effectiveness in meeting the image quality requirements for the screening and assessment of pre-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both traditional clinical settings and in telemedicine. The proposed device exploits recent technological advances in high sensitivity charge coupled device (CCD) cameras and digital signal processing electronics. Today's CCD cameras do not have the dynamic range to image the human retina. The human retina is characterized by regions of high reflectivity (20-40 percent), such as the optic disc, and very low reflectivity (<2 percent), such as the macula and fovea. Further, these existing digital cameras treat each of the color channels in the same manner and do not consider the special, red-saturated characteristics of the retina. The approach builds on existing fundus imaging technology developed by Kestrel for the National Eye Institute. The proposed Optimized Retinal Camera will be shown to offer significant improvement over existing digital color cameras by addressing each of the deficiencies mentioned above.

"Vortex Tubed Thermocycler with Intelligent Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel system is proposed for the rapid identification of DNA. The system comprises of a unique thermocycler platform built around the extraordinary vortex tube, detection optics, intelligent software to provide users with information on most ideal operating conditions, and virtual insight into the PCR process as it progresses. An intelligent user interface will allow DNA amplification/detection on an unprecedented timescale (less than 10 minutes). A multi-disciplinary team that consists of a chemical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and two biochemists has been assembled for this project. The efficiency of the vortex tube will be optimized by the use of computational fluid dynamics. Heat transfer between the gas phase and the cuvets will be improved through computational fluid dynamic calculations. The intelligent software consists of a detailed mathematical model that uses similar starting conditions as the initial cuvet composition to model the amplification progress and it performs a virtual PCR in parallel with the actual process.

"Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The goal of the research proposed herein is to develop a low-cost, user-friendly, computer-based imaging system for use by women to reduce anxiety and distress relating to alopecia (hair loss) prior to or following chemotherapy. It has been reported that 47 percent to 58 percent of women with cancer cite the likelihood of alopecia as the most disturbing anticipated aspect of receiving chemotherapy; 8 percent stated that they seriously considered refusing treatment due to this possibility. Utilizing advanced graphical processing techniques, the proposed ""Help for Alopecia through Image Representations"" (HAIR) system will permit cancer patients of all races and ethnicities to interactively visualize, using their own image, the process of hair loss, accessorization options (e.g., wigs, head scarves, hats, etc.), and the corresponding stages of hair regrowth. ""Scripting"" (i.e., rehearsing) the side effects of chemotherapy and potential patient responses will significantly reduce the anxiety caused by the prospect of alopecia. This will serve to desensitize women to alopecia, allow them to make better informed treatment decisions, and facilitate coping when it occurs.            n/a",Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress,6834860,R44CA099873,"['Internet', 'alopecia', 'anxiety', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'coping', 'desensitization psychotherapy', 'drug adverse effect', 'female', 'human subject', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'neoplasm /cancer chemotherapy', 'patient oriented research', 'psychological aspect of cancer', 'quality of life', 'women&apos', 's health']",NCI,"BARRON ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2004,350214,-0.019541539649792803
"Locating and Reading Informational Signs  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to construct computer vision systems to enable the blind and severely visually impaired to detect and read informational text in city scenes. The informational text can be street signs, bus numbers hospital signs, supermarket signs, and names of products (eg. Kellogg's cornflakes). We will construct portable prototype computer vision systems implemented by digital cameras attached to personal, or hand held, computers. The camera need only be pointed in the general direction of the text (so the text is only one percent of the image). A speech synthesizer will read the text to the user. Blind and visually impaired users will test the device in the field (under supervision) and give feedback to improve the algorithms. We argue that this work will make a significant contribution to improving human health (rehabilitation). Computer vision is a rapidly maturing technology with immense potential to help the blind and visually impaired. Reports suggest that detecting and reading informational text is one of the main unsatisfied desires of these groups. Written signs and information in the environment are used for navigation, shopping, operating equipment, identifying buses, and many other purposes (to which a blind person does not otherwise have independent access). The blind and severely visually impaired make up a large fraction of the US population (3 million). Moreover, this proportion is expected to increase by a factor of two in the next ten years due to increased life expectancy. Our proposal is design-driven. It uses a new class of computer vision algorithms known as Data Driven Monte Carlo (DDMCMC). The algorithms are used to: (i) search for text, and (ii) to read it. Recent developments in digital cameras and portable/handheld computers make it practical to implement these algorithms in portable prototype systems. The three scientists in this proposal have the necessary expertise to accomplish it. Dr.'s Yuille and Zhu have backgrounds in computer vision and Dr. Brabyn has experience in developing and testing engineering systems to help the blind and visually impaired. Our proposal falls within the scope of the Bioengineering initiative because we are applying techniques from the mathematical/engineering sciences to develop informatic approaches for patient rehabilitation. More specifically, our work will facilitate the development of portable devices to help the blind and visually impaired.   n/a",Locating and Reading Informational Signs,6801171,R01EY013875,"['blind aid', 'blindness', 'clinical research', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'cues', 'human subject', 'reading', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2004,329706,-0.002211141698668385
"National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing (RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC) is a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, software engineers, and medical investigators who develop computational tools for the analysis and visualization of medical image data. The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state-of-the-art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed, open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neuroscience and neurological disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. The overall analysis will occur at a range of scales, and will occur across a range of modalities including diffusion MRI, quantitative EGG, and metabolic and receptor PET, but potentially including microscopic, genomic, and other image data. It will apply to image data from individual patients, and to studies executed across large populations.

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains.

"Content based mammogram retrieval as a diagnostic aid The objective of this project is to perform the initial development and evaluation of a computer aid to assist radiologists in their interpretation of mammograms. We will develop and evaluate an approach to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD(, in which the radiologist will be assisted by a content-based search engine that will display examples of lesions, with known pathology, that are similar to the lesion being evaluated. We will model the perceptual similarity between two lesion images as a non-linear function of those images, and use algorithms (support vector machines and artificial neural networks) to learn this function from similarity techniques that will allow the radiologist to refine the search by indicating preferences among the retrieved images, providing a capability similar to that present in text-search engines. We will focus only on the retrieval of images of microcalcification clusters (MCCs) to determine the feasibility of later developing a more-complete system capable of handling multiple lesion classes. The project will involve a thorough performance evaluation to determine the merits of continued development of the proposed approach to CAD. We will perform statistical analyses of inter-observer and intra-observer notions of image similarity, and use modern statistical resampling procedures to evaluate the generation error of our nonlinear similarity model.

"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to test the feasibility of a ""Smart Telescope"" for use to improve the ability of visually impaired persons in tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. Advances in low-power high-speed portable computers combined with novel computer vision algorithms enable us to build an affordable, portable, and cosmetically acceptable digital telescope that can enable visually impaired persons to perform these tasks with greater ease than with current telescopes.        The computer vision algorithms first detect regions of interest in an image where targets are likely to be, even if these targets occupy only a small portion of the visual field, obviating the need for a user to scan or search a scene as would be necessary with an ordinary telescope. Next, novel object-specific super-resolution enhancement algorithms use target-specific knowledge to magnify and enhance these regions so that users can interpret them, similar to pointing a telescope at those regions.

"Vector Quantization for Image Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This Phase-I SBIR application addresses the increasingly significant challenges faced by pathologists and clinicians in manually inspecting microscope slides. Microscopic inspection suffers from being labor-intensive, subjective, expensive and limited by the need for physical access to the glass slide specimen of interest. The obstacle to automated microscopic inspection has been the inability to efficiently digitize entire microscope specimens at high resolutions. Aperio has developed the ScanScope (R), a novel microscope slide scanner that makes it practical - for the first time - to rapidly create virtual microscope slides at high resolutions. Virtual slides set the stage for automating microscopic inspection using automated pattern recognition. This research aims to adapt and optimize Aperio's existing and novel algorithms for vector quantization (VQ) to the problem of automatic pattern recognition in virtual slides. VQ is a general mathematical technique for encoding bitstreams using a vocabulary. The primary aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of using VQ for pattern recognition in a practical and well-characterized application: automatically finding virtually all micrometastasis clusters in cytology specimens. This proposed research represents a first attempt to automate pattern recognition in virtual slides using VQ.         n/a",Vector Quantization for Image Pattern Recognition,6695147,R43EB001617,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cell line', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cytology', ' digital imaging', ' high throughput technology', ' metastasis', ' microscopy', ' nomenclature']",NIBIB,"APERIO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2003,97269,0.008539202208870188

Currently, researchers can get remarkably detailed images of living cells and their  constituent proteins using molecular genetic and microscopy-based approaches in conjunction with  sophisticated microscopy hardware. Available image analysis techniques and software, however, lag behind  the power of this new imaging equipment to visualize the microscopic world.  This phase I SBIR project will apply existing technology in spatial analysis of satellite image data to microscopy data, create new statistical techniques specific to the study of spatial association of proteins in  cells, and create software that implements these statistics for use in the analysis of spatial association timeslice in vivo biomedical imagery.   n/a","MicroSeer, Analysis software for microscopy imagery",6581125,R43EB000575,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer data analysis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' image processing', ' statistics /biometry', ' structural biology']",NIBIB,BIOMEDWARE,R43,2003,177261,0.014198264894374316
"Vessel Segmentation/Registration from Ultrasound Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Ultrasound is widely used for imaging of blood vessels as it is non-invasive, real-time, and relatively inexpensive. This proposal focuses on segmentation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) from ultrasound images with extension to other vascular imaging applications in the long term. Reliable quantitative evaluation of AAAs plays a pivotal role in diagnoses and frequent follow-up studies needed to avoid life-threatening rupture. These studies require vessel segmentation (for size analysis) and registration between serial studies (for monitoring the progression of the disease before and/or after vascular repair). AAA evaluation is routinely carried out for both high-risk patient populations and those treated with endovascular repair. Currently, AAA management is primarily based on measurements from two-dimensional (2-D) slices in CT scans. AAA monitoring and follow-up could be improved by 1) measurement from 3-D reconstructions, and 2) use of ultrasound imaging to minimize radiation exposure and reduce costs. 3-D ultrasound reconstructions provide accuracy comparable to that of CT. However, large inter-observer variability and long processing times preclude routine clinical use of 3-D image information. This research aims to develop software solutions for improved ultrasound-based AAA monitoring and other vascular diseases (in the long term). The tools used will be based on advanced image segmentation and registration algorithms involving curvature-driven image processing techniques and deformable models. The goal of the Phase I study is to establish feasibility of the proposed methods by demonstrating an improvement in the repeatability and accuracy of measurements and reduction in delineation time.         n/a",Vessel Segmentation/Registration from Ultrasound Images,6641019,R43HL069540,"['abdomen', ' aorta aneurysm', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' gastrointestinal circulation disorder', ' gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', ' human data', ' mathematics', ' three dimensional imaging /topography']",NHLBI,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2003,99621,0.0018301854432051996
"KNOWLEDGED BASED SYSTEMS FOR DIAGNOSTIC HISTOPATHOLOGY  The proposed work extends previous research performed by this                                                                     investigator in the field of knowledge-based systems for the analysis of             histopathologic material, mainly neoplastic tissue; and mostly focusing on           adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The present application concerns the creation        of methods for the definition and analysis of novel histopathologic features         predominantly derived from nuclear image data, with the objective of defining        ""prototype identities."" According to the investigator, these are fundamental         complexes of histologic features unique to individual tissue samples, or small       groups of such samples, that should convey useful predictive value for               individual patients. Many of these features are not normally discernable to the      eye, even to the experienced observer. They encompass a large number of primary      and derived nuclear morphometric measures, including what are referred to as         ""weak features,"" that is those that have not in the past shown strong                correlative utility by standard statistical measures. Derived measures include       feature and heterogeneity profiles.

"Optimized Retinal Camera DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A low-cost, high-resolution, high-contrast color digital camera optimized for ophthalmology will be demonstrated. This Optimized Retinal Camera will be specifically tested for its effectiveness in meeting the image quality requirements for the screening and assessment of pre-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both traditional clinical settings and in telemedicine. The proposed device exploits recent technological advances in high sensitivity charge coupled device (CCD) cameras and digital signal processing electronics. Today's CCD cameras do not have the dynamic range to image the human retina. The human retina is characterized by regions of high reflectivity (20-40 percent), such as the optic disc, and very low reflectivity (<2 percent), such as the macula and fovea. Further, these existing digital cameras treat each of the color channels in the same manner and do not consider the special, red-saturated characteristics of the retina. The approach builds on existing fundus imaging technology developed by Kestrel for the National Eye Institute. The proposed Optimized Retinal Camera will be shown to offer significant improvement over existing digital color cameras by addressing each of the deficiencies mentioned above. Joslin Diabetes Center, the University of Iowa Department of Opthalmology, and the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center will provide independent, ""masked"" evaluation of the optimized digital retinal images. n/a",Optimized Retinal Camera,6583366,R44EY013038,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' charge coupled device camera', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diabetic retinopathy', ' digital imaging', ' human subject', ' image processing', ' ophthalmoscopy', ' thermodynamics']",NEI,KESTREL CORPORATION,R44,2003,431799,0.016375749957749652
"Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  The goal of the research proposed herein is to develop a low-cost, user-friendly, computer-based imaging system for use by women to reduce anxiety and distress relating to alopecia (hair loss) prior to or following chemotherapy. It has been reported that 47% to 58% of women with cancer cite the likelihood of alopecia as the most disturbing anticipated aspect of receiving chemotherapy, with 8% stating that they seriously considered refusing treatment due to this possibility. Utilizing advanced graphical processing techniques, the proposed ""Help for Alopecia through Image Representations"" (HAIR) system will permit cancer patients of all races and ethnicities to interactively visualize, using their own image, the process of hair loss, accessorization options (e.g., wigs, head scarves, hats, etc.), and the corresponding stages of hair regrowth. ""Scripting"" (i.e., rehearsing) the side-effects of chemotherapy and potential patient responses will significantly reduce the anxiety caused by the prospect of alopecia. This will serve to desensitize women to alopecia, allow them to make better-informed treatment decisions, and facilitate coping when it occurs.         n/a",Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress,6586963,R43CA099873,"['alopecia', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' coping', ' desensitization psychotherapy', ' drug adverse effect', ' female', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' psychological aspect of cancer', ' quality of life', "" women's health""]",NCI,"BARRON ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2003,99973,-0.019557270390203087
"Locating and Reading Informational Signs  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to construct computer vision systems to enable the blind and severely visually impaired to detect and read informational text in city scenes. The informational text can be street signs, bus numbers hospital signs, supermarket signs, and names of products (eg. Kellogg's cornflakes). We will construct portable prototype computer vision systems implemented by digital cameras attached to personal, or hand held, computers. The camera need only be pointed in the general direction of the text (so the text is only one percent of the image). A speech synthesizer will read the text to the user. Blind and visually impaired users will test the device in the field (under supervision) and give feedback to improve the algorithms. We argue that this work will make a significant contribution to improving human health (rehabilitation). Computer vision is a rapidly maturing technology with immense potential to help the blind and visually impaired. Reports suggest that detecting and reading informational text is one of the main unsatisfied desires of these groups. Written signs and information in the environment are used for navigation, shopping, operating equipment, identifying buses, and many other purposes (to which a blind person does not otherwise have independent access). The blind and severely visually impaired make up a large fraction of the US population (3 million). Moreover, this proportion is expected to increase by a factor of two in the next ten years due to increased life expectancy. Our proposal is design-driven. It uses a new class of computer vision algorithms known as Data Driven Monte Carlo (DDMCMC). The algorithms are used to: (i) search for text, and (ii) to read it. Recent developments in digital cameras and portable/handheld computers make it practical to implement these algorithms in portable prototype systems. The three scientists in this proposal have the necessary expertise to accomplish it. Dr.'s Yuille and Zhu have backgrounds in computer vision and Dr. Brabyn has experience in developing and testing engineering systems to help the blind and visually impaired. Our proposal falls within the scope of the Bioengineering initiative because we are applying techniques from the mathematical/engineering sciences to develop informatic approaches for patient rehabilitation. More specifically, our work will facilitate the development of portable devices to help the blind and visually impaired.   n/a",Locating and Reading Informational Signs,6666671,R01EY013875,"['blind aid', ' blindness', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' cues', ' human subject', ' reading', ' vision aid', ' vision disorders']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,327524,-0.002211141698668385
"Novel Methods for Automated Key Image Selection    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Significant new knowledge about human behavior and the brain has come to light in recent years, due in part to rapid technical developments in imaging. As the role of imaging becomes increasingly important in neurosciences, effective methods for managing and retrieving images will become even more critical; without such advances, further progress will be hindered. The goal of this proposal is the automated summarization of large imaging sets. Image summarization proffers a method to compress imaging studies by selecting only pertinent image slices that objectively document a patient's condition; as such, its applications include multimedia electronic medical records, telemedicine, and teaching files. In Phase I, development is focused on a customizable brain atlas used for registering patient imaging studies in order to select key images. This phase addresses selection of images from ""normal"" studies and studies with only subtle morphological changes, as typical of most patients with psychiatric disorders. Automatic techniques for customizing the atlas to imaging study acquisition parameters are developed, in addition to registration methods for mapping the atlas to the patient's original study. Building from this initial work, Phase II expands to encompass selection of images from ""abnormal"" studies that exhibit gross morphological changes through principle component analysis, further customization of the atlas for different age groups (e.g., pediatric), and incorporation of structured data entry (SDE) and natural language processing (NLP) of medical reports to help guide automatic selection of key images. The resultant product will be a fully automated software system that can select relevant images from any imaging study. Initial evaluation in Phase I will examine the performance of the contrast customizable atlas and summarization/relevant slice selection, as compared to human experts.         n/a",Novel Methods for Automated Key Image Selection,6583176,R43MH065764,"['archives', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' human data', ' image processing', ' method development']",NIMH,MEDAXIS CORPORATION,R43,2003,93365,0.003109945001516782
"Content based mammogram retrieval as a diagnostic aid The objective of this project is to perform the initial development and evaluation of a computer aid to assist radiologists in their interpretation of mammograms. We will develop and evaluate an approach to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD(, in which the radiologist will be assisted by a content-based search engine that will display examples of lesions, with known pathology, that are similar to the lesion being evaluated. We will model the perceptual similarity between two lesion images as a non-linear function of those images, and use algorithms (support vector machines and artificial neural networks) to learn this function from similarity techniques that will allow the radiologist to refine the search by indicating preferences among the retrieved images, providing a capability similar to that present in text-search engines. We will focus only on the retrieval of images of microcalcification clusters (MCCs) to determine the feasibility of later developing a more-complete system capable of handling multiple lesion classes. The project will involve a thorough performance evaluation to determine the merits of continued development of the proposed approach to CAD.

"Automated PCR Pathogen Detection and Quantification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We will develop software for automated pathogen detection and quantification using data from PCR experiments. Automated pathogen detection using data from a PCR experiment requires software to determine whether DNA from the pathogen is present or absent in a sample. We will develop a pattern-matching algorithm to mathematically analyze PCR amplification data. We will optimize the algorithm against a data set of at least 5000 PCR reactions (including a significant set of data gathered during the anthrax attack) to determine its efficacy and limitations. We expect the pathogen detection algorithms to distinguish positives samples from negative samples in more than 98% of the samples, to find inconclusive results in less than 1% of the samples, and to incorrectly classify less than 1% of the samples. We will also develop software to perform automated melting curve analysis of samples that our detection algorithm has determined to be positive or inconclusive. The melting profile of the probes is a property of the assay, and it can be used for secondary confirmation of a pathogen by comparing the profile of the unknown samples to the profile of the assay's positive controls. We will develop algorithms to automatically determine whether the melting profile of the sample and controls match. With melting analysis confirmation, the failure rate of the final detection algorithm should be less than 0.5%.   Automated pathogen quantification requires software to determine the number of copies of a pathogen's DNA in a sample. We will develop discrete dynamical models of PCR for quantification. We will optimize these methods against a large data set of PCR reactions with dilution series. We will systematically determine the features of the models that provide information and the features that can be ignored. We will measure efficacy by comparing computed DNA copy numbers against the known concentrations (as specified by experimenters), and against each other. We will use the most effective model (or models) in the software we produce.   n/a",Automated PCR Pathogen Detection and Quantification,6555484,R43AI052944,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioterrorism /chemical warfare', ' communicable disease diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' microorganism', ' nucleic acid denaturation', ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' phase change', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NIAID,IDAHO TECHNOLOGY,R43,2002,100000,-0.016294774238913144

"Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Cytogenetics The goal of this project is to develop innovative digital microscope autofocusing techniques for automated cytogenetics applications.  We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to focus measurement and detection, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform.  In comparison to currently available single-resolution techniques, the proposed method overcomes their fundamental limitations and promises considerably more accurate, reliable and faster means to compute and determine in-focus image position for image acquisition.  This will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated scanning microscope instruments for clinical and cancer cytogenetics applications. In Phase 1 we will investigate the feasibility of the proposed method based on its utilization in fluorescence microscopy.  We will develop and implement the algorithm and software for multi-resolution focus function computation and in-focus position determination.  We will test and evaluate the new method against the current best-performing algorithms by comparing (1) Accuracy; (2)  Range; (3)  Insensitivity to other parameters; and (4)  Speed. If the new approach achieves superior performance, in Phase 2 the technique will be further developed and extended to bright-field microscopy applications.  When fully developed, the new technology will be made available to Applied Imaging (AIC) for integration into the PowerGene cytogenetics automation products. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: As soon as the new techniques are developed and qualified for routine application, they will be made available to AIC for incorporation into the PowerGene product line of cytogenetics automation equipment, both in new systems sold and as an upgrade to existing systems already in use in cytogenetics labs, thus commercializing the technology quickly. n/a",Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Cytogenetics,6443502,R43RR016817,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cytogenetics', ' digital imaging', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' fluorescent in situ hybridization', ' human data', ' image enhancement', ' image processing', ' mathematical model']",NCRR,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R43,2002,91727,0.01686859766332262
"KNOWLEDGED BASED SYSTEMS FOR DIAGNOSTIC HISTOPATHOLOGY  The proposed work extends previous research performed by this                                                                     investigator in the field of knowledge-based systems for the analysis of             histopathologic material, mainly neoplastic tissue; and mostly focusing on           adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The present application concerns the creation        of methods for the definition and analysis of novel histopathologic features         predominantly derived from nuclear image data, with the objective of defining        ""prototype identities."" According to the investigator, these are fundamental         complexes of histologic features unique to individual tissue samples, or small       groups of such samples, that should convey useful predictive value for               individual patients. Many of these features are not normally discernable to the      eye, even to the experienced observer.

"Digital Elevation Models for Population Estimates Research exploring the feasibility of deriving population estimates from remotely sensed data demonstrates that objects in the urban landscape can be identified and incorporated into a population estimates system based on the housing unit method. Nonetheless, this research also reveals shortcomings in the technology producing the input files used in the automatic detection of objects. The problem involves the assumption and techniques used when converting high resolution images into digital elevation models (DEM). DEM files serve as input to the programs used in the detection of housing units. Efforts to correctly identify housing units are time-consuming and error-prone without clear and distinct DEMs. The objectives of this Phase I SBIR application are to further refine strengthen and test the software employed in transforming satellite and aerial imagery into digital elevation model (DEMs).

"Deployment Framework for Medical Imaging Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are many reasons for the relatively slow proliferation of advanced medical image processing methods but a significant reason is the present paradigm for providing access: most applications are still tied to proprietary software and hardware environments that carry significant up-front costs. The ultimate intent of this work is leverage commodity computing technologies to develop an open, extensible framework for deploying medical image processing applications in the heterogeneous, networked computing environment of today. The framework will provide clinicians and researchers access to state-of-the-art image processing applications regardless of their particular computing platform or locally available computing resources connecting them with federated database resources, with high-end computing resources, or even with their colleagues in a peer-to-peer computing environment. The aims for Phase I of this project are: (1) Demonstrate that the framework provides access to image processing applications to an extent that is largely independent of local computing resources. (2) Demonstrate that the framework is general in that the same components can be reused for deploying a wide variety of medical imaging applications. (3) Demonstrate that the framework is customizable both by third-party developers and by end-users allowing power-users to both create and deploy new applications. Work in Phase II will extend the framework and develop two-demonstration applications--computer aided diagnosis (CAD) for mammography and multimodality image fusion. The ultimate goal is to obtain key partnerships and the private equity investment necessary for commercialization, which will proceed by launching revenue-generating versions of the CAD and image fusion applications. n/a",Deployment Framework for Medical Imaging Applications,6494576,R44EB000149,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' clinical research', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer network', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mammography', ' mathematics', ' positron emission tomography', ' telemedicine']",NIBIB,"FRONTIER MEDICAL, LLC",R44,2002,143577,-0.01789379119232861
"Locating and Reading Informational Signs  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to construct computer vision systems to enable the blind and severely visually impaired to detect and read informational text in city scenes. The informational text can be street signs, bus numbers hospital signs, supermarket signs, and names of products (eg. Kellogg's cornflakes). We will construct portable prototype computer vision systems implemented by digital cameras attached to personal, or hand held, computers. The camera need only be pointed in the general direction of the text (so the text is only one percent of the image). A speech synthesizer will read the text to the user. Blind and visually impaired users will test the device in the field (under supervision) and give feedback to improve the algorithms. We argue that this work will make a significant contribution to improving human health (rehabilitation). Computer vision is a rapidly maturing technology with immense potential to help the blind and visually impaired. Reports suggest that detecting and reading informational text is one of the main unsatisfied desires of these groups. Written signs and information in the environment are used for navigation, shopping, operating equipment, identifying buses, and many other purposes (to which a blind person does not otherwise have independent access). The blind and severely visually impaired make up a large fraction of the US population (3 million). Moreover, this proportion is expected to increase by a factor of two in the next ten years due to increased life expectancy. Our proposal is design-driven. It uses a new class of computer vision algorithms known as Data Driven Monte Carlo (DDMCMC). The algorithms are used to: (i) search for text, and (ii) to read it. Recent developments in digital cameras and portable/handheld computers make it practical to implement these algorithms in portable prototype systems. The three scientists in this proposal have the necessary expertise to accomplish it. Dr.'s Yuille and Zhu have backgrounds in computer vision and Dr. Brabyn has experience in developing and testing engineering systems to help the blind and visually impaired. Our proposal falls within the scope of the Bioengineering initiative because we are applying techniques from the mathematical/engineering sciences to develop informatic approaches for patient rehabilitation. More specifically, our work will facilitate the development of portable devices to help the blind and visually impaired.   n/a",Locating and Reading Informational Signs,6547549,R01EY013875,"['blind aid', ' blindness', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' cues', ' human subject', ' reading', ' vision aid', ' vision disorders']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2002,338540,-0.002211141698668385

This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.

"MAX-ENTROPY CONTROL FOR HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL IMAGING   A low-cost, high-resolution, high-contrast color digital camera optimized        for ophthalmology will be demonstrated. The maximum entropy camera         will be tested for its effectiveness in meeting the image quality requirements       for telemedicine and for remote screening of pre-proliferative and                   proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The proposed device exploits recent              technological advances in high sensitivity CCD cameras and digital signal            processing electronics. Today's low cost 8-bit CCD cameras do not have the           dynamic range to image the human retina, which is characterized by regions of        high reflectivity (20-40 percent), such as the optic disc, and very low              reflectivity (<2 percent), such as the macula and fovea. Existing digital            cameras used in ophthalmology are not designed to deal with the high dynamic         range and do not consider the special re-saturated characteristics of the            retina. The proposed device will be shown to offer significant improvement over      existing digital color cameras by addressing each of the deficiencies                mentioned.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY Computer algorithms based on pattern recognition are being used in many areas of science and technology to assist the scientist in solving complex, time-consuming, and often tedious real-world problems.  The basic premise is to train a computer to efficiently identify a known pattern in an unknown dataset.  This needle-in-a-haystack approach is being used in the area of genomics, where there are already several examples of very powerful computational pattern recognition approaches available for searching new sequences for structural motifs, similarities to other proteins and DNA, and predicting secondary structure, based solely on the DNA or amino acid sequence.  We believe that macromolecular crystallography can also benefit from the application of pattern recognition to the often daunting task of fitting atoms into an electron density map.  The fact that electron density maps are three-dimensional images provides an additional challenge to this technology in that the procedures we are developing in order to find matching patterns must be rotation invariant.  To test the validity of our hypothesis we will complete the following aims: 1) we will develop a set of rotation invariant features that can characterize the patterns in regions of an electron density map, 2) we will determine the optimal size of feature regions and the size and type of structural database required to find similar regions of electron density capable of accurately determining structures, and 3) we will develop a methodology to synthesize matched regions to produce coherent local and global models of protein structure. If these goals can be met, we will investigate the feasibility of incorporating knowledge-based methods, neural networks, and other AI techniques to augment the interpretation of structures from electron density maps.  In addition, we will attempt to extend this methodology to produce initial structures for electron density maps that are either of poor quality and/or low resolution.  n/a",PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,6182183,R21GM059398,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electron crystallography', ' electron density', ' molecular biology information system', ' physical model', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2000,101500,-0.039324292879157605
"MICRO-OPTICS-BASED DIGITAL ALLERGEN COUNTER The current pollen identification and counting method based on microscopic visual examination is very time consuming and labor intensive. More importantly, it is very ""subjective"" and not truly scientific. Intelligent Optical Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a portable digital allergen counter (DAC) to accurately and reliably count and identify airborne pollen grains and fungal spores. The proposed DAC combines a micro-image scanner, a high-speed video chip, an allergen morphology data bank, and a built-in image processor into an integrated and automated pollen counter. The DAC will rapidly identify and quantify pollen, grains and spores. By making it much easier to collect allergen information in multiple locations, the proposed device will reduce morbidity by providing improved warnings on days with high pollen counts. The specific aims of the Phase I project are to design and construct optical image scanner suitable for allergen detection, identify the morphology of several types of pollen, grains, and spores, integrate the DAC system and test and evaluate the system feasibility. In Phase II, an engineering prototype of a portable instrument will be built and field-validated with real-world samples. We will also expand its capability to increase the pollen types of interest. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: A compact, simple, and easy-to-use digital allergen counting system that can monitor indoor or outdoor air quality that will minimize people's overexposure to allergens.

"IMAGE PATTERN BASED WAVELET COMPRESSION FOR RADIOLOGY DESCRIPTION:  The research and development of teleradiology and telemedicine     systems has progressed through many technical and clinical endeavors.  When      dealing with large volume image transmission and storage, image data             compression is an outstanding issue in medical applications to which current     techniques were not designed to address.  The technical objectives of this       project are to develop optimized error-free as well as error-controllable        methods for medical image compression based on wavelet transform and             associated methods.  In this project, we employ both advanced artificial         intelligent and compression techniques to achieve these goals.                                                                                                    Our recent research outcomes include:  (a) development of a mathematics          approach to unify prediction, subband, and wavelet transforms, (b)               development of convolution neural network training methods to obtain             optimized wavelet kernel, (c) development of a data splitting technique to       improve edge accuracy and to provide error-control methods, and (d)              development of an integer implementation method for all wavelet transforms,      etc.  Based on the above technical advances, we propose to use integer form      of an adaptive (optimized) wavelets in conjunction with newly developed          coding methods such as ""partitioning in hierarchical trees"" (PHT) for            lossless compression.  For error-controllable approaches, we propose to use      adaptive wavelets coupled with optimized neural network prediction methods       in this study.  Since lossless compression is a part of the error -              controllable method, both systems can be implemented in the same scheme          which is a breakthrough approach in the field.  We will compare the              compression results (i.e., compression ratio and speed) of the proposed          compression methods with those of the current wavelet techniques using the       embedded zero-tree coding method.  At the end of the project, we will            deliver a software package for the radiological society.  Hence, the             evaluation for various clinical applications using the proposed methods can      be performed by the investigators.                                                                                                                                As the field of telemedicine is rapidly growing, we believe that development     of a dedicated compression module for economical storage and fast                communication of patient data (particularly for patient images) is               necessary.  This project is designed to address the related technical issues     with a strong clinical consideration.                                             n/a",IMAGE PATTERN BASED WAVELET COMPRESSION FOR RADIOLOGY,6173899,R01CA079139,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' charge coupled device camera', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' human data', ' image processing', ' radiology', ' telemedicine']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,176034,0.007463023340215519
"DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED IMAGE REPORTING SYSTEM We have constructed a prototype structured reporting system that replaces conventional dictation and transcription for medical image reporting. Key design features include reporting speed, generation of graphical reports, structured storage of imaging findings, and the use of existing lexicons. Pilot timing data suggest that a radiologist using our system can generate a report more rapidly than with conventional reporting methods or speech recognition systems. Support is sought to refine the prototype, and to conduct feasibility testing. The specific aims are (1) to augment and refine a hierarchical test lexicon of imaging terms (2) to develop methods for the representation and reporting of imaging findings and their logical relationships, (3) to evaluate the system's performance on clinical imaging reports, and (4) to assess the completeness of existing lexicons for imaging. The project is supported by a Technical Advisory Committee comprised of experts in key methodological areas. A successful Phase I will lead (in Phase II) to testing of the approach for cross-sectional imaging, to adoption, augmentation, and use of an existing lexicon, to construction of real-time decision support techniques based on the knowledge base of imaging findings generated by the system, and to system evaluation in a clinical setting. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Our structured reporting system is appealing to radiologists because it speeds up the reporting process compared to conventional dictation/transcription or speech recognition. In addition, the system eliminates the costs, delays, inaccuracies, and other organizational problems associated with transcription services, thereby improving patient care. Therefore, time-efficient, speech-augmented structured reporting systems will likely capture a significant segment of the $1.2 billion annual market for radiology transcription services.  n/a",DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED IMAGE REPORTING SYSTEM,6073984,R43LM006837,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' information systems', ' vocabulary', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"EDICT SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2000,98563,-0.06362450769597311
"WAVELET ENHANCEMENT OF CHROMOSOME BANDING PATTERNS This project aims to develop and commercialize significantly improved software for digital enhancement of the detail of chromosome banding patterns in microscopic images. These investigators have developed an innovative technique for this application, based upon wavelet transforms and multiresolution image analysis.

This will help clinicians and researchers detect previously invisible or sub-visible band pattern alterations in conventional and high resolution banding. It will significantly increase the ability of automated instruments to assist the evaluation of chromosome alterations in clinical samples and in normal and neoplastic mammalian cells. During Phase I we implemented and tested three wavelet transforms with desirable mathematical properties. We developed a prototype multiresolution image processing system for chromosome enhancement. We obtained extremely encouraging results, strongly suggesting that these techniques offer considerably improved enhancement capability over conventional methods. and clearly demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. In Phase II we will complete the implementation and refinement of the software. We will implement several wavelet design approaches and evaluate many wavelet transform basis function sets that potentially can bring out relevant detail in chromosome banding patterns.

COMPUTER AIDED CARDIAC MEASUREMENT The objective of the proposed research is to develop a method for providing fast and accurate measurements of volume and ejection fraction from 3D echo images. Our Computer Aided Measurement System will reconstruct the LV endocardium using a few user selected points on oriented echocardiographic images together with prior shape and size knowledge.

To improve the ease of use of the prototype system for application in a clinical setting. 3. To expand the catalog representing our knowledge base by acquiring additional large volume and abnormally shaped LV's in order to enhance fitting accuracy for atypical shapes. Previously described methods of analyzing echocardiograms in 3D require so much manual labor that this modality has been limited to research applications. The advantages of our proposed approach are that it makes the superior accuracy and reproducibility of 3D echo available for clinical practice. Furthermore this process will be applicable to other imaging modalities.

"TOPIC #411 - PHASE I SBIR CONTRACT - DE-IDENTIFICATION SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR CANCER IMAGING RESEARCH Developing artificial intelligence technology for medical imaging applications requires training models on large and diverse datasets.  Currently, aggregation of large data repositories, including radiology and pathology images, is limited by concerns around patient privacy.  In order to successfully share medical images, an institution must be able to quickly and accurately de-identify large numbers of images in batches.  This process is currently manual and time-consuming. We propose a pipeline to remove PHI from both radiology DICOM images and pathology whole slide images by leveraging machine learning, natural language processing, and compartmentalized workflow techniques to significantly reduce the human intervention needed to anonymize medical images.  In addition to examining header data in the images, we will use optical character recognition and computer vision algorithms to detect text in any location or orientation in the image, then automatically record and subsequently purge these regions. These techniques will be configured to work on a variety of image types (CT, MRI, radiograph, etc) and cover multiple OEM vendors for both radiology and pathology images.

"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine.

"Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study PROJECT SUMMARY Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks), neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features; 2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2) creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4) develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Roads and neighborhoods with a built environment that support safe and active transportation are a major priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to 90% of road traffic deaths occurring in these locations, especially to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, yet data on key built environment features at a large scale are not always readily available in these settings. My career goal is to improve population health by examining the effects of the built environment and transportation on health through the adoption and use of methods that can leverage Big Data sources and answer complex, multilevel research questions by overcoming the lack of built environment data in LMICs. The proposed research uses deep learning and advanced statistical methods to create a citywide dataset of built and social environment features in Bogota, Colombia that will provide crucial data to answer questions of their impact on pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as assessing the presence of health inequities in their distribution and that will lay the groundwork to expand these efforts to more cities in Latin America and other LMICs.","Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study",10123391,K01TW011782,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Colombia', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Latin America', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Typology', 'Urban Developments', 'Urban Health', 'Vehicle crash', 'Writing', 'automated image analysis', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data infrastructure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'neighborhood association', 'neural network', 'pedestrian injury', 'population health', 'skills', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'virtual']",FIC,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,138024,0.00024909333438509127
"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications. n/a",SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections,10019459,R01AG067396,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriuria', 'Caregivers', 'Catheters', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'heterogenous data', 'hologram', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'laboratory facility', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,291252,-0.006244822050570579
"Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Abstract The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability. The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications. We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various biomedical disciplines.

"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation in assisting radiologists for tasks such as segmentation of cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data.

"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9913520,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,235027,0.027835613795447724
"Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence Summary / Abstract Objective — The goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize novel deep learning (DL) assisted approaches to improve diagnosis and clinical decision-making for congenital heart disease (CHD). This will be achieved by using DL, machine learning (ML), and related methods to extract diagnosis, biometric characterizations, and other information from fetal ultrasound imaging. Notably, this work includes a clinical translational evaluation of these methods in a population-wide imaging collection spanning two decades, tens of thousands of patients, and several clinical centers. Background — Despite clear and numerous benefits to prenatal detection of CHD and an ability for fetal ultrasound to detect over 90% of CHD lesions in theory, in practice the fetal CHD detection rate is closer to 50%. Prior literature suggests a key cause of this startling diagnosis gap is suboptimal acquisition and interpretation of fetal heart images. DL is a novel data science technique that is proving excellent at pattern recognition in images. DL models are a function of the design and tuning of a neural network architecture, and the curation and processing of the image data used to train the network. Preliminary Studies — We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in echocardiography and CHD (Drs. Grady, Levine, and Arnaout), DL and data science (Drs. Keiser, Butte and Arnaout), and statistics and clinical research (Drs. Arnaout and Grady) and secured access to tens of thousands of multicenter (UCSF and six other centers), multimodal fetal imaging studies. We have created a scalable image processing pipeline to transform clinical studies into image data ready for computing. We have designed and trained DL models to find key cardiac views in fetal ultrasound, calculate standard and advanced fetal cardiac biometrics from those views, and distinguish between normal hearts and certain CHD lesions. Hypothesis — While DL is powerful, much work is still needed to adapt it for clinical imaging and to translate it toward clinically relevant performance in patient populations. We hypothesize that an integrated ensemble DL/ML approach can lead to vast improvements in fetal CHD diagnosis. Aims — To this end, the main Aims of this proposal are (1) to develop and optimize neural network architectures and efficient data inputs to relieve key performance bottlenecks for DL in fetal CHD; and (2) to deploy DL models population-wide to evaluate their ability to improve diagnosis, biometric characterization, and precision phenotyping over the current standard of care. Our methods include DL/ML algorithms and retrospective imaging analysis. Environment and Impact — This work will be supported in an outstanding environment for research at the crossroads of data science, cardiovascular and fetal imaging, and translational informatics. The work proposed will provide valuable tools and insight into designing and evaluating both the data and the algorithms for DL on imaging for clinically relevant goals, and will lay important groundwork for DL-assisted phenotyping for both clinical use and precision medicine research. Project Narrative Medical imaging is critical to almost every type of diagnostic and management decision, but human interpretation of medical images can lack accuracy and reproducibility. By developing machine learning methods for analyzing medical images, the work in our proposal can improve diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging, for both clinical and research uses.",Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence,9867431,R01HL150394,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Apical', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Heart', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computerized data processing', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data harmonization', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'heart imaging', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repaired', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,806128,-0.005972294031377061
"Advancing Ulcerative Colitis Monitoring with Deep Learning Models Project Summary/Abstract The number of practicing pathologists around the world is expected to decrease by as much as 30% over the next two decades, with some of the world’s poorest countries having a ratio of only one pathologist to many hundreds of thousands of people. At the same time, the diagnostic caseload that requires their expertise in clinical trials and hospital settings will continue to grow. The digitization of pathology data, coupled with the use of machine learning techniques for analyzing and scoring the data, provides exciting opportunities to make the field of pathology more efficient and scalable, even as the workforce continues to evolve. Deep learning in particular provides the potential to enhance the interpretation of medical images by improving the detection of image-based biomarkers for a broad range of diseases. Image interpretation plays an important role in patient eligibility and endpoint determination during the course of clinical trials. For patients with ulcerative colitis, the development of trained and reliable algorithms that can help pathologists identify disease progression and response to treatment in a timely and effective manner can provide benefit in two important ways. First, it will help to ensure that the most appropriate score for histological disease severity is being assigned to each image using the Robarts Histopathology Index (RHI) or similar grading scale. Second, it will support a triage process by which images known to contain non- healthy tissues can be prioritized for earlier assessment. Through a unique partnership between Azavea, a geospatial technology and machine learning firm, and Robarts, a clinical trials organization, the proposed research will begin to address these needs by developing deep learning algorithms for histopathology digital image analysis, testing them on machine-readable annotations of medical imagery from previous clinical studies, and exposing them through a metadata- searchable interface that will enable the images to be categorized and quickly accessed by pathologists and others to support reader training and increase communication between multiple readers and sites. In so doing, it will not only help streamline the evaluation of new ulcerative colitis treatments that rely heavily on the image interpretation process, but also provide the foundation for the identification of additional components present in other gastrointestinal disease indications in the future. Project Narrative The proposed research will contribute critical new insights on the reliability, sensitivity, and practicality of machine learning to support gastrointestinal disease detection and evaluation in a clinical trials setting. In pathology, where manual interpretation of images using a microscope has remained relatively unchanged for decades, machine learning provides particular potential to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses by reducing the subjectivity that is often inherent in the process.",Advancing Ulcerative Colitis Monitoring with Deep Learning Models,10081185,R43EB030441,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endoscopy', 'Endpoint Determination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning Skill', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Software Design', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'gastrointestinal', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging detection', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'prototype', 'software development', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,"AZAVEA, INC",R43,2020,150000,0.010690052037061495
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9997914,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,498014,-0.016673784105916807

"Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to facilitate both: (1) ease and reliability of quality data capture in a pediatric population from users with a range of otscopy expertise, and; (2) assist interpretation of the TOMi Scope’s correlated otoscopy and depth-resolved images in order to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, effective management. Significance: Ear infections affect 93% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed (~50% accuracy) and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antimicrobial over-prescription and resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic adoption (7-38% reported use) and accuracy (50-70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user expertise. Therefore, there is a clear and unmet need for superior, objective screening, starting with a definitive yet easily and reliably usable diagnostic tool for this extremely prevalent yet poorly managed disease. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope imaging guidance and diagnostic classification will facilitate both: 1) ease-of-use and reliable quality data collection improvement, and 2) accurate detection of the presence or absence of MEE, as well as classification of the type of infection, regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect labeled TOMi Scope data (otoscopy and depth-scan images) from 268 patients at pediatric offices affiliated with UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, (2) Achieve reliable usability of the TOMi Scope by guiding image capture using TOMi-net, a deep learning model, (3) Develop a multimodal deep learning model to provide diagnostic assistance using TOMi Scope otoscopy and depth-scan data. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with a superior user experience and new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antimicrobial prescription and consequent resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience issues of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy,10156035,R44DC017422,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Appointment', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Unit', 'Collection', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Elements', 'External auditory canal', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otoscopy', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Resistance development', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Universities', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'ear infection', 'effusion', 'electronic data capture system', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'image guided', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'middle ear fluid', 'multimodality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDCD,"PHOTONICARE, INC.",R44,2020,1136886,-0.007510004980646116

"Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models Project Summary Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia FTD are devastating neurodegenerative disorders that lie on a genetic and mechanistic continuum. ALS is a disease of motor neurons that that is almost uniformly lethal within only 3-5 years of diagnosis. FTD is a heterogeneous, rapidly progressing syndrome that is among the top three causes of presenile dementia. About 10% of ALS cases are caused by dominantly transmitted gene defects. SOD1 and FUS mutations cause aggressive motor neuron pathology while TDP43 mutations cause ALS-FTD. Further, wild type FUS and TDP43 are components of abnormal inclusions in many FTD cases, suggesting a mechanistic link between these disorders. Early phenotypes are of particular interest because these could lead to targeted interventions aimed at the root cause of the disorder that could stem the currently inexorable disease progression. Elucidating such early, potentially shared characteristics of these disorders should be greatly aided by: 1) knock-in animal models expressing familial ALS-FTD genes; 2) sensitive, rigorous and objective behavioral phenotyping methods to analyze and compare models generated in different laboratories. In published work the co-PIs applied their first-generation, machine vision-based automated phenotyping method, ACBM ‘1.0’ (automated continuous behavioral monitoring) to detect and quantify the earliest-observed phenotypes in Tdp43Q331K knock-in mice. This method entails continuous video recording for 5 days to generate >14 million frames/mouse. These videos are then scored by a trained computer vision system. In addition to its sensitivity, objectivity and reproducibility, a major advantage of this method is the ability to acquire and archive video recordings and to analyze the data at sites, including the Cloud, remote from those of acquisition. We will use Google Cloud TPUs supercomputers that have been designed from the ground up to accelerate cutting-edge machine learning workloads, with a special focus on deep learning. We will analyze this data using Bayesian hierarchical spline models that describe the different mouse behaviors along the circadian rhythm. The current proposal has two main goals: 1) Use deep learning to refine and apply a Next Generation ACBM - ‘2.0’ - that will allow for more sensitive, expansive and robust automated behavioral phenotyping of four novel knock-in models along with the well characterized SOD1G93A transgenic mouse. 2) To establish and validate procedures to enable remote acquisition of video recording data with cloud-based analysis. Our vision is to establish sensitive, robust, objective, and open-source machine vision-based behavioral analysis tools that will be widely available to researchers in the field. Since all the computer-annotated video data is standardized in ACBM 2.0 and will be archived, we envision a searchable ‘behavioral database’, that can be freely mined and analyzed. Such tools are critical to accelerate the development of novel and effective therapeutics for ALS-FTD. Narrative ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are devastating, rapidly progressing diseases and current treatments are of limited value. In this proposal a neuroscientist and a computer scientist have teamed up to develop a new machine vision-based method for behavioral analysis novel mouse models of ALS-FTD. The ultimate goal is to reveal early phenotypes in ALS-FTD models that can be used in understanding disease pathology and in the development of new therapeutic targets.",Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models,9979408,R21NS112743,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Expression Profiling', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Paralysed', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Presenile Dementia', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Paralysis', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cloud based', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'interest', 'knockin animal', 'machine vision', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein TDP-43', 'stem', 'supercomputer', 'superoxide dismutase 1', 'tool']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,446875,-0.013496012742151394
"Novel machine learning approaches for improving structural discrimination in cryo-electron tomography Project Summary Cellular cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) has made possible the observation of cellular organelles and macromolecular complexes at nanometer resolution with native conformations. The rapid increasing amount of Cryo-ET data available however brings along some major challenges for analysis which we will timely ad- dress in this proposal. We will design novel data-driven machine learning algorithms for improving structural discrimination and resolution. In particular, we have the following speciﬁc aims: (1) We will develop a novel Autoencoder and Iterative region Matching (AIM) algorithm for marker-free alignment of image tilt-series to re- construct tomograms with improved resolution; (2) We will develop a saliency-based auto-picking algorithm for better detecting macromolecular complexes, and combine it with an innovative 2D-to-3D framework to further improve structure detection accuracy; (3) We will design an end-to-end convolutional model for pose-invariant clustering of subtomograms. This model will produce an initial clustering which will be reﬁned by a new subto- mogram averaging algorithm that automatically down-weights subtomograms of noise and little contribution; (4) We will perform experimental evaluations by using previously reported bacterial secretion systems and mito- chondrial ultrastructures datasets to improve the ﬁnal resolution. Implementing algorithms in Aims 1-3, we will develop a user-friendly open-source graphical user interface -tom to directly beneﬁt the scientiﬁc community.  -tom will be systematically compared with existing software including IMOD, EMAN2, and Relion on simulated and benchmark datasets. To facilitate distribution, -tom will be integrated into existing software platforms Sci- pion and TomoMiner.

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9973167,R01HL142036,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm training', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual clinical trial']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,383601,0.025243108170767276
"Advancing algorithms for image-based profiling Project Summary    Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image samples.

"Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer. Project Narrative We develop technology that will enable researchers to tap into the enormous amount of imaging data in multiple institutions to create deep learning models for cancer applications without requiring sharing of patient data. Our work will thus enable development of more robust deep learning models to improve clinical decision making in cancer than models currently built on data from single institutions. Although our focus is improving decision making in the primary brain cancer, our methods and tools are generalizable and will be broadly applicable to all cancers, with the potential for improvement in clinical care and patient health.",Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,10018827,U01CA242879,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Brain', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Glioma', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Information Networks', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data privacy', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient privacy', 'radiologist', 'research to practice', 'software systems', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,394824,-0.018573868686930173
"Deep Learning of Street View Imagery to assess Urban Green Space Relationships with Mental Health:  A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY The built environment is an important modifiable determinant of human health, yet our ability to understand its effects on human health have been limited by the lack of scalable data on specific components (and exposures) of the built environment. The emergence of ubiquitous geo-referenced imagery in the United States (e.g. Google Street View Imagery), combined with recent advances in image processing using deep learning algorithms, offers unprecedented opportunity for measuring street-level built environment features at scales needed for population-based research. To develop and demonstrate the potential of deep learning algorithms for environmental health research we will: develop methods to assess green space features using street view imagery and deep learning algorithms; create new deep learning algorithms to predict urban green space quality, stress reduction and restorative potential; and apply new street view measures to 9,070 adult Twin Pairs in the Washington Twin Registry to determine associations between green space and mental health. Our proposed study will dramatically move the field of environmental health forward by provided a completely new, transferable and scalable exposure assessment method for assessing built environment exposures relevant to human health and provide robust information on how urban green space influences mental health. Overall, our new approach will provide rich new data sources for environmental epidemiologists, city planners, policy makers and neighborhoods and communities at large. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment is an important determinant of human health, yet our ability to measure specific components of the built environment relevant to health is limited.

"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user’s location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user’s location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user’s trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings. The proposed research would result in a new smartphone-based wayfinding app that could greatly increase travel independence for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,9899994,R01EY029033,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cost Measures', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elevator', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Indoor environment', 'Infrastructure', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Needs Assessment', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Research', 'Schools', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'interest', 'lens', 'meetings', 'open source', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'way finding', 'wireless fidelity']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,416374,-0.026098720605725035
"International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) 2020 Project summary  The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation and facilitation of research and education in the fields of medical image computing and computer assisted interventions, including biomedical imaging and robotics. This aim is achieved through the organization and operation of regular international conferences of the highest quality, and publications that promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience by leading institutions and outstanding scientists, physicians, and educators around the world. MICCAI Conferences have their origin in three separate but related conferences beginning in early 1990s--Visualization in Biomedical Computing, Computer Vision and Virtual Reality in Robotics and Medicine, and Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery--, which merged into a single annual conference in 1998. MICCAI Conferences have defined new scientific disciplines over the years and have become the premier meeting in the field. The conference proceedings have an impact factor comparable to high-impact computational journals. Conference topics include, computer vision & medical image processing, computer-aided diagnosis, interventions & surgery, machine learning in medical imaging, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality, bioscience and biology applications, imaging systems and new biomedical imaging applications, spanning disciplines such as radiology, pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry.  The MICCAI conference includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. The quality and importance of poster presentations are considered to be on a par with those of oral presentations, with both undergoing a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance). Selected presented papers became landmark publications over the years with up to 2,000 citations. The conference series includes satellite events like community-driven software challenges, workshops and tutorials just before and/or after the main conference. These events focus on the current status and advances in topics relevant to MICCAI and are very well attended. The MICCAI Conferences span the entire globe and are usually rotated among the American, European, and Asian continents. Attendees are typically from over 45 countries, with strong student representation (>40%). The MICCAI 2020 Conference will be held in Lima, Peru in October 4th-8th, 2020. Since 2018, a Mentorship Program to connect students and young investigators with established mentors from academia and industry is also part of the conference. Along with the Mentorship Program and mission of the “Women in MICCAI” Committee, this proposal requests funds to support student and early investigator travel awards to enhance diversity in conference attendance (including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and people from disadvantaged backgrounds) and provide minority groups with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations.

"Task-aware and Autonomous Robotic C-arm Servoing for Flouroscopy-guided Interventions Project Summary Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is used in more than 17 million procedures across the US and constitutes the state-of-care for various percutaneous procedures, including internal ﬁxation of pelvic ring injuries. To infer procedural progress from 2D radiographs, well-deﬁned views onto anatomy must be achieved and restored multiple times during surgery. This process, known as ”ﬂuoro hunting”, is associated with 4.7 s of excessive ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm position (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), yielding radiographs that are never interpreted clinically, but drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical staff.  Our long-term project goal is to use concepts from machine learning and active vision to develop task-aware algorithms for autonomous robotic C-arm servoing that interpret intra-operative radiographs and autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to acquire ﬂuoroscopic images that are optimal for inference. We have three speciﬁc aims: 1) Detecting unfavorable K-wire trajectories from monoplane ﬂuoroscopy images: We will extend a physics-based sim- ulation framework for ﬂuoroscopy from CT that enables fast generation of structured and realistic radiographs documenting procedural progress. Based on this data, we will train a state-of-the-art convolutional neural net- work that interprets ﬂuoroscopic images to infer procedural progress. 2) Developing and validating a task-aware imaging system in silico: Using the autonomous interpretation tools and simulation pipeline available through Aim 1, we will train an artiﬁcial agent based on reinforcement learning and active vision. This agent will be capable of analyzing intra-operative ﬂuoroscopic images to autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to yield task- optimal views onto anatomy. 3) Demonstrating feasibility of our task-aware imaging concept ex vivo: Our third aim will establish task-aware C-arm imaging in controlled clinical environments. We will attempt internal ﬁxation of anterior pelvic ring fractures and our task-aware artiﬁcial agent will interpret intra-operatively acquired ra- diographs to infer procedural progress and suggest optimal C-arm poses that will be realized manually with an optically-tracked mobile C-arm system.  This work combines the expertise of a computer scientist, a surgical robotics expert, and an orthopedic trauma surgeon to explore the untapped, understudied area of autonomous imaging enabled by advances in machine learning in ﬂuoroscopy-guided procedures. This development has only recently been made feasible by innovations in fast ﬂuoroscopy simulation from CT to provide structured data for training that is sufﬁciently realistic to warrant generalization to clinical data. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to investigate autonomous and task-aware C-arm imaging systems, paving the way for a new paradigm in medical image acquisition, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients by task-oriented image acquisition on a patient-speciﬁc basis. Subsequent R01 funding will customize this concept to other high-volume procedures, such as vertebroplasty. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is the state-of-care for percutaneous fracture ﬁxation, and requires surgeons to achieve and reproduce well deﬁned views onto anatomy to infer procedural progress. This requirement alone is estimated to contribute 4.7 s of ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm repositioning (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical team. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning-based C-arm servoing algorithms that introduce task awareness by interpreting intra-operative radiographs and autonomously adjusting the C-arm pose to task-optimal views.",Task-aware and Autonomous Robotic C-arm Servoing for Flouroscopy-guided Interventions,9972122,R21EB028505,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Bladder', 'Cadaver', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Compression Fracture', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Expert Systems', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Fracture', 'Fracture Fixation', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Orthopedics', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scientist', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Width', 'Work', 'active vision', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm training', 'arm', 'base', 'bone', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'femoral artery', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'spine bone structure', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,193784,-0.005097628235953501
"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives. Project Narrative Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides which currently available solutions do not overcome.

"AI platform for microscopy image restoration and virtual staining AI Platform for Microscopy Image Restoration and Virtual Staining Project Summary:  Fluorescence microscopy has enabled many major discoveries in biomedical sciences. Despite the rapid advancements in optics, lasers, probes, cameras and novel techniques, major factors such as spatial and temporal resolution, light exposure, signal-to-noise, depth of penetration and probe spectra continue to limit the types of experiments that are possible. Deep learning (DL) algorithms are well suited for image-based problems like SNR/super-resolution restoration and virtual staining, which have great enabling potentials for microscopy experiments. Previously impossible experiments could be realized such as achieving high signal-to-noise and/or spatial-temporal resolution without photobleaching/phototoxicity; simultaneously observing many image channels without interfering with native processes, etc. This could pave the way for a quantum leap forward in microscopy-based discoveries that elucidate biological functions and the mechanisms of disorders, and enable new diagnostics and therapies for human diseases.  However, these new methods have not been widely translated to new microscopy experiments. The delay is due to several practical hurdles and challenges such as required expertise, computing and trust. In order to accelerate the adoption of DL in microscopy, novel AI platform tailored for biologists are needed for training, applying and validating DL models and outputs.  The present project aims to develop an AI platform for microscopy image restoration and virtual staining called AI for Restoring and Staining (AIRS) platform. With our collaborator, Dr. Hari Shroff (National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering) we have successfully created DL models for SNR restoration, super-resolution restoration and virtual staining for a variety of imaging conditions and organelles in our preliminary studies. The AIRS platform intends to (1)provide a comprehensive suite of validated DL models for microscopy restoration and virtual staining applications including SNR restoration, super-resolution restoration, spatial deconvolution, spectral unmixing, prediction of 3d from 2d images, organelle virtual staining and analysis; (2)provide plug and play for common microscopy experiments; (3)provide semi-automatic update training to tailor DL models to match advanced microscopy experiments; (4)provide user friendly support for new DL model training for pioneering microscopy experiments; (5)provide confidence scores to assess the output results by a DL model, (6) provide DL models that avoid image artifact (hallucination) and allow continuous learning and evolution; (7) and be able to access the required computing infrastructure and database connection. Project Narrative Deep learning (DL) algorithms have great enabling potentials for microscopy experiments. Previously impossible experiments could now be realized. This could pave the way for a quantum leap forward in microscopy-based discoveries.  Powered by deep learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with Dr. Hari Shroff and 7 additional labs, this project aims to create an AI platform for microscopy image restorations and virtual staining called AI for restoring and staining (AIRS).

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9989025,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,612684,-0.012337270127381995
"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology. Project Narrative The proposed research will study the relationship between the three-dimensional (3D) optic nerve head (ONH) related structure and glaucoma. Our study will advance the current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis by gaining new insights into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establishing ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles.

"2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting to be held from February 25-27, 2021, which will be the seventh of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and lodging for junior researchers who will be presenting at the workshop: undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty. Some funds may also be allocated to help pay for live webcasting and publication costs related to workshop materials. As with previous meetings, we intend to stream each session of the meeting in real-time, allowing those who are interested in the proceedings but unable to attend in person to access them online for free. As mortalities associated with pulmonary disease continue to rise worldwide, innovative imaging techniques capable of both diagnosing and helping to treat these pathologies are becoming an increasingly important. As a field, pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the structural, functional and molecular assessment of lung disorders than at any time in its history. What is more, these techniques are being developed and optimized by researchers across an increasingly diverse set of fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, computer science and medicine. Given the field's rapidly-evolving nature, the existence of a regular forum in which scientists and clinicians can communicate their ideas with each other is of the utmost importance. Given the absence of other scientific meetings with a similarly focused agenda, our previous workshops have succeeded in providing just such a forum—allowing a diverse group of pulmonary imaging researchers to come together for the kind of rigorous, collaborative exchange that can continue to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) host a one-day workshop on pulmonary inflammation; (2) inform the pulmonary imaging community of the latest advances in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (3) explore the use of pulmonary imaging to evaluate therapeutic response, the inherent obstacles to doing so, and strategies to overcome them; (4) investigate new approaches for integrating deep learning and pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately diagnose and phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (5) broadcast the entire workshop live online, thereby enabling interested parties not in attendance to access the proceedings in real-time, free of charge. Based on the uniformly positive feedback in response to our one-day boot camp on pulmonary physiology prior to the 2019 workshop, we intend to hold another boot camp before the 2021 meeting, this time focused on pulmonary inflammation. This boot camp will consist of ~5 longer presentations (approximately 1 hour each) on topics related to this central theme, with significant time devoted to question and answer after each, and a final discussion panel aimed at synthesizing the most important issues covered over the course of the day. In addition to this exciting addition to the format, the 2021 workshop will again seek a more equitable balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease across the invited talks, while also continuing to expand our recent focus on the topics of imaging assessments of treatment response and the integration of imaging techniques with machine learning. Finally, the 2021 workshop add a session on bridging the gap between current clinical practice and innovative imaging technologies. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. This recurring workshop provides a necessary and valuable opportunity for researchers working in the fields of functional, structural, and molecular imaging technique development for assessing lung diseases such as lung cancer, COPD, IPF and ARDS to come together in order to discuss and share their work.

"An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic ABSTRACT More than 20 million patients suffer from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma. These degenerative eye diseases develop over decades, and their prevalence is increasing. Retinal imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy are essential tools in the investigation and management of eye disease. New quantitative biomarkers derived from these and other imaging modalities are critical to the clinical translation of emerging ophthalmic innovations. However, biomarker development in the era of artificial intelligence requires large volumes of annotated images and transparent, reproducible processes, which places new demands on the management of living subjects research, data sharing, and algorithm development. Unfortunately, current software platforms are not effective in integrating these data in a manner that meets specific requirements in ophthalmology, Our goal in this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, consistent with objectives of the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, is to create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, analysis, and sharing of ocular images and data. We will extend the capabilities of systems developed by the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP), Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), which include: (a) LATTICE - a software solution that reduces costs, reduces errors, and improves communications in the management of living-subjects research; (b) MOSAIC - an image processing platform and algorithm library with traditional and AI-trained algorithms; and (c) The AOIP Image Bank - a Repository that houses images and data on 1578 fully-consent human research subjects. To create the integrative platform, we will address four aims: (a) Extend LATTICE to meet the workflow requirements of academic and sponsored research in local and multisite environments, including the extensible direct integration of data relevant to ocular studies; (b) Design and implement a hybrid (local + cloud) REPOSITORY architecture, data schema, knowledge ontology, and query architecture for Owners and Readers of data.; (c) Integrate and demonstrate LATTICE, REPOSITORY and MOSAIC into a continuous ocular science workflow and (d) integrate and demonstrate Lattice, Repository and Mosaic into a continuous ocular science workflow. Our Integrated Translational Imaging platform will enable ophthalmic innovators to translate sight-saving insights and interventions to the clinic faster, with less frustration, and greater confidence. Our proposal fills an important technology gap in the field of ophthalmic data science and biomarker development. While the number and type of imaging devices continues to grow, the tools to develop and deploy new biomarkers and clinical endpoints using these exquisite imaging devices has not kept pace. With this program we will enable a new generation of image-driven innovation to find its way to the clinic. Project Narrative With more than 20 million patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma, it is crucial to develop non-invasive biomarkers as early predictors of eye disease and reliable tests of the safety and efficacy of new preventative and restorative therapies. To meet the unmet need for rapid access and analysis of ophthalmic research data for the discovery of these biomarkers, we will create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, sharing, and analysis of ocular images and data.

"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal develops a technology platform that will enable automated microinjection of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded tools such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles, into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session.

"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation. Leveraging our open source SimVascular project, the proposed project will enable rapid expansion of the existing Vascular Model Repository while ensuring model credibility and reproducibility to foster innovation in clinical and basic science cardiovascular research.",Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository,10016840,R01LM013120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Basic Science', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Engineering', 'Source Code', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'computing resources', 'data curation', 'data format', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gigabyte', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open data', 'open source', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'stem', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'supervised learning', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning', 'web portal']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,330502,0.011354550020604136
"Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data This project aims to develop NeuroManager™, an innovative neuroinformatics platform for advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data. A core technology that we will develop in NeuroManager will be Image Content Analysis for Retrieval Using Semantics (ICARUS), a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable image retrieval based on visual appearance or by semantic concept. ICARUS will use machine learning applied to content-based image retrieval - (CBIR) to build and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign semantic concepts to neuroimages. Neuroscience research generates extensive, multifaceted data that is considerably under-utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source lab. On the other hand, there are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results. Unfortunately, none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. To solve this problem, NeuroManager will include the following distinct, significant innovations: (i) versatility for handling two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humans; (ii) functionality to share complex datasets that extends secure, privacy-controlled paradigms from institutional, laboratory-based and even public domains; (iii) flexibility to implement NeuroManager within an institute’s IT infrastructure, or on most cloud-based virtualized environments including Azure, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services; (iv) and most importantly, the ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data sets. The benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be to foster collaboration between scientists and institutions, promoting innovation through combined expertise in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. This will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levels (i.e., macroscopically, microscopically, subcellularly and functionally), ultimately leading to an improved basis for developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will prove feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR on 2D whole slide images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaborators. Work in Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations mentioned above. A competing technology with comparable functionality, addressing the full breadth of needs for modern neuroscience research, is currently not available commercially or otherwise.

"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,9979523,R03AI146437,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acrylates', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Antibiotics', 'Applications Grants', 'Bacteria', 'Cells', 'Chlamydia', 'Chlamydia Infections', 'Chlamydia genome', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye Infections', 'Gel', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lead', 'Light Microscope', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'PF4 Gene', 'Penicillins', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sodium', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chlamydia vaccine', 'human pathogen', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,77243,-0.028611217887016017
"SBIR Phase I Topic 402: Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Image-based evaluation of lymph nodes is an essential step in cancer diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. Current clinical practice mostly uses qualitative or semi-quantitative measures in evaluation and thus suffers from inaccuracy due to intra- and inter-observer variability and increased human efforts. This becomes a more serious issue in head and neck cancers due to the large number of clinically relevant lymph nodes. In this project an AI-based automatic segmentation software will be developed for quantitative cervical lymph node evaluation to increase the accuracy and reduce the cost. However, there are a few challenges in developing and deploying such a software due to different clinical practices such as usage of different modalities (MRI and/or CT) and complex clinical workflow. To address these challenges, a novel AI algorithm that can handle the variability in imaging modalities and support incremental learning using site-specific data to enhance its robustness will be developed; a private-cloud-based software framework with high usability will then be developed to incorporate this algorithm and provide advanced visualization and reporting for clinical usage. This software will have high impact on all stages of patient care for head and neck cancers and can be further extended to other cancers. n/a","SBIR Phase I Topic 402: Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring",10269836,5N91020C00048,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cervical lymph node group', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Reporting', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Framework', 'Visualization', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer prevention', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'imaging modality', 'lymph nodes', 'novel', 'segmentation algorithm', 'usability']",NCI,"CARINA MEDICAL, LLC",N43,2020,400000,-0.0088468267489507
"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi-resolution imaging of the brain and spine while the surgeon operates.",An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System,10017876,R44CA112966,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Capital', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Michigan', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Monitor', 'Navigation System', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spine surgery', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Veterinary Schools', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cancer surgery', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cranium', 'deep neural network', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'neurosurgery', 'next generation', 'operation', 'point of care', 'portability', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spine bone structure', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2020,1279629,-0.00880735118025977
"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease. The imaging informatics platform described in this application will enable biomedical researchers to capture, analyze, and share imaging and related data.

"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health.

"Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc- tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi- ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol- ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam- ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo- rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex- traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us- ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti- cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in- clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova- tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol- umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo- rithms will segment the images at multiple scales. The third area of innovation will focus on efficient multi- channel analysis. The proposed project will include creation of an easy-to-use software tool for assembling and visualizing multiscale tissue data called Tissue Atlas Navigation Graphical Overview (TANGO). PROJECT NARRATIVE Composition and organization of cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) they are embedded in, controls the function of different organs in human body. Alterations in any of these can lead to onset and progression of var- ious diseases. The proposed project will develop image analytics algorithms and open source software for high- resolution 3-D mapping of skin, the largest organ in the human body, and evaluate molecular and architectural changes due to aging and UV exposure.",Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues,10246250,UH3CA246594,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multiomic Data', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organ Model', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Aging', 'Skin Tissue', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'analysis pipeline', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'high dimensionality', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'multiplexed imaging', 'multiscale data', 'open source', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sample collection', 'single cell analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tomography', 'tool']",NCI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,UH3,2020,750000,0.022567149900852148
"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,9970170,R01AI138993,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Arizona', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Cells', 'Care Technology Points', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Face', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Health Care', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virotherapy', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'density', 'design', 'health care settings', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'light scattering', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'technology development', 'technology validation']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2020,991540,-0.028987574360714887
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",9890853,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'myocardial injury', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,795348,0.005791992398933817
"Deep LOGISMOS Abstract: This is a competitive continuation of a project that already yielded the highly flexible, accurate, and broadly applicable LOGISMOS framework for context-aware n-dimensional image segmentation. To substantially improve and extend its capability, we will develop Deep LOGISMOS that combines and reinforces the complementary advantages of LOGISMOS and deep learning (DL). There is growing need for quantitative failure-free 3D and higher-D image analysis for diagnostic and/or planning purposes. Examples of current use exist in radiation oncology, cardiology, ophthalmology and other areas of routine clinical medicine, many of which however still rely on manual slice-by-slice tracing. This manual nature of such analyses hinders their use in precision medicine. Deep LOGISMOS research proposed here will solve this problem and will offer routine efficient analysis of clinical images of analyzable quality. To stimulate a new phase of this research project, we hypothesize that: Advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms, when combined with deep-learning-derived application/modality specific parameters and allowing highly efficient expert-analyst guidance working in concert with the segmentation algorithms, will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired, complex, diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. The proposed research focuses on establishing an image segmentation and analysis framework combining the strengths of LOGISMOS and DL, developing a new way to efficiently generate training data necessary for learning from examples, forming a failure-free strategy for 3D, 4D, and generally n-D quantitative medical image analysis, and discovering ways for automated segmentation quality control. We will fulfill these specific aims:  1. Develop an efficient approach for building large segmentation training datasets in 3D, 4D, n-D  using assisted and suggestive annotations.  2. Develop Deep LOGISMOS, combining two well-established algorithmic strategies – deep learning  and LOGISMOS graph search.  3. Develop and validate methods employing deep learning for quality control of Deep LOGISMOS.  4. In healthcare-relevant applications, demonstrate that Deep LOGISMOS improves segmentation  performance in comparison with state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Deep LOGISMOS will bring broadly available routine quantification of clinical images, positively impacting the role of reliable image-based information in tomorrow’s precision medicine. Narrative: Previous phases of this successful research project were devoted to the development of new graph-based methods for multi-surface and/or multi-object multi-dimensional biomedical image segmentation. Deep learning is emerging as an important new way to learn from large sets of examples. This proposal will combine deep learning and graph-based image analysis to maximize their combined strengths and overcome their individual weaknesses with the overarching goal to facilitate routine use of quantitative medical image analysis techniques in personalized medical care.",Deep LOGISMOS,10016301,R01EB004640,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Ophthalmology', 'Organ', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Slice', 'Stroke', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'adjudication', 'automated analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'diabetic', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macular edema', 'n-dimensional', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'success', 'task analysis', 'treatment planning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,396286,0.032821455531120786
"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II 1 Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large, multi-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA- and BD2K- funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for the multi-site QC workflows that will come with the unified platform that MIQA represents: a design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that simplifies the creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific results findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site, web-based software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system and machine learning to aid in QC processes. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automated notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, MIQA is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop a web-based, multi-site, open-source platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. MIQA will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive reviews and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II,10010814,R44MH119022,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Alcohols', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'FAIR principles', 'Four-dimensional', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Writing', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dexterity', 'image archival system', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'open source', 'operation', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'software systems', 'success', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'web interface']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2020,819293,-0.0029250255412442134
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,10241562,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2020,2500,-0.0002830315470888017
"Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality Over the past 15 years, new imaging technologies and methods for high throughput imaging have revolutionized structural biology by extending the resolution and scale of collected images in 3 dimensions. The resulting image volumes are more typically hundreds of GB to even tens of TB and in some cases approach PB sizes. These file sizes pose challenges for image acquisition, image analysis, and communication of a representative set of raw data and quantification. Image acquisition runs can be lengthy and expensive, and often errors are not identified until after the completion of scanning. Large files contain many structures, and require machine learning (ML) strategies in a context that permits error correction. Scientific communication requires tools for ready access to raw data, and more efficient methods to communicate the rapidly accumulating sets of scientific information. We propose to leverage virtual reality (VR) and verbal communication within the VR environment, to streamline each of these stages of scientific work, by capitalizing on the more natural abilities for stereoscopic vision and hearing to process scenes and language. Based upon the tool base and direct volume rendering of large files that we have established in our VR software, called syGlass, we will first integrate VR into the microscope controls for tuning the microscope and then efficiently inspecting images in 3D as they are acquired (Aim 1). Next, we will introduce novel domain adaptation techniques in the ML field to scale up 3D image quantification capabilities for current acquisition sizes, by coupling them with user-optimized experiences that do not require ML expertise, and yet provide automated and accurate results (Aim 2). Finally, we will provide tools to efficiently generate narrated scientific presentations in VR for use in the lab setting, as manuscript publications, and for production of educational materials (Aim 3). In each of these activities, we will introduce paradigm shifts in the management of experiments, analysis of the resulting data, and publication of manuscripts and materials to other scientists and the general public. The goal of this project is to speed the pipeline from image acquisition to communication of analyzed data for large image files (big data). We propose to leverage virtual reality to change the way users interact with their microscope, provide new methods for more accurate quantification and make scientific data more transparent, and more accessible to specialists and the general public. These new paradigms are applicable to basic, pre-clinical and clinical research, and serve the goals of big data projects to generate more reliable and encompassing scientific conclusions.","Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality",10011054,R44MH125238,"['3-Dimensional', '3D virtual reality', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Depth Perception', 'Educational Materials', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Distribution', 'Ingestion', 'Instruction', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Resort', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'adaptation algorithm', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'field study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'movie', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical research', 'scale up', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment']",NIMH,ISTOVISR,R44,2020,1159612,0.021057007015431783
"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies.

This instrument will facilitate research that seeks to better understand molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis in the context of its spatial environment and will be critical for the development of clinically correlative biomarkers for next generation precision medicine research initiatives at Baylor College of Medicine.",S10 Shared Instrument Grant - Leica Aperio Digital Scanner GT450,9940426,S10OD028671,"['Animals', 'Biological Models', 'Breast', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Line', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Microscope', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer cell', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'college', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel marker', 'open source', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'whole slide imaging']",OD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,S10,2020,477043,-0.012596111680353107
"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics. In all three aims, large animal studies and human subject data will be used for optimization and validation. Narrative The success of imaging technology developments proposed in this grant will substantially improve the image quality, reduce patient dose, expand the applications of cardiac SPECT from mainly static imaging to dynamic imaging, and establish multi-isotope clinical imaging.",Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies,10064473,R01HL154345,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DCNU', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infarction', 'Isotopes', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Molecular Target', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myopathy', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Tail', 'Toxic effect', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'animal data', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'new growth', 'parametric imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'technology development']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,806926,-0.019525933627808245
"SCH:Smartphone Wound Image Parameter Analysis and Decision Support in Mobile Env PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the U.S., with an estimated treatment cost of $25 billion. Our team proposes research to advance our existing NSF-funded smartphone wound analysis system, which helps patients monitor their diabetic foot ulcers, providing them with instant feedback on healing progress. Our wound system analyzes a smartphone image of the patients' wound, detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score by comparing the current image with a past image. Our envisioned chronic wound assessment system will support evidence-based decisions by the care team while visiting patients, and move wound care toward digital objectivity. We define digital objectivity as the synthesis of wound assessment metrics that are extracted autonomously from images in order to generate objective actionable feedback, enabling clinicians not trained as wound specialists to deliver ""standardized wound care"". Digital objectivity contrasts with the current practice of subjective, visual inspection of wounds based on physician experience. The first aim will develop image processing algorithms to mitigate wound analysis errors caused by non-ideal lighting in some clinical or home settings, and when the wound is photographed from arbitrary camera angles and distance. While our previous wound system worked well in ideal conditions, non-ideal lighting caused large errors and healthy skin was detected as the wound area in extreme cases. The second aim extends our existing wound analysis system that targets only diabetic wounds to handle arterial, venous and pressure ulcers, expanding the potential user. The third aim will synthesize algorithms that autonomously generate actionable wound decision rules that are learned from decisions taken by actual wound clinicians. This research is joint work of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) (technical expertise in image processing, machine learning and smartphone programming) and University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) (clinical expertise on wounds, and wound patient recruitment to validate our work) RELEVANCE (See instructions): We propose research to advance our existing smartphone wound analysis system, which detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score from a wound image.

"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9991958,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data dissemination', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2020,655482,0.011104845663283444
"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution. The work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease.","A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue",10231018,UH3CA246633,"['Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freeze Drying', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Granuloma', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'Morphology', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Readiness', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'graphical user interface', 'high dimensionality', 'high resolution imaging', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'ion source', 'machine learning method', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'reagent standardization', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UH3,2020,700000,-0.02500821831972114
"Neighborhood Looking Glass: 360 Degree Automated Characterization of the Built Environment for Neighborhood Effects Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal represents a vertical advancement in neighborhood effects research, producing for the first time, national neighborhood indicators of the built environment. Thus far, only local studies have been conducted due to the resource-intensive nature of site visits to conduct assessments of community features and also manual annotations of street images. With the recent advancement of computer vision and the emergence of massive sources of image data, we will leverage our team’s abilities to develop a data collection strategy utilizing geographic information systems to assemble a national collection of Google Street View images of all road intersections and street segments in the United States. We will utilize this data bank, and develop informatics algorithms to produce neighborhood summaries of built environment that have been theoretically and empirically identified to be important for health outcomes. After the creation of Neighborhood Looking Glass, we will conduct investigations into the impact of neighborhood environments on health utilizing medical records from hundreds of thousands of patients and accounting for predisposing characteristics in analyses. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, computer vision, bioinformatics, and computer science—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Develop informatics techniques to produce neighborhood quality indicators; 2) Measure the accuracy of data algorithms and construct an interactive geoportal for neighborhood data visualization and data sharing, 3) Utilize Neighborhood Looking Glass and a large collection of medical records from Intermountain Healthcare to investigate neighborhood influences on the risk of obesity and substance abuse. The epidemic rise in chronic health conditions is recent and as such suggests its cause is social, cultural, and constructed rather than purely biological. Thus, we have the possibility of intervening on the environment to better support health. Recent studies suggest that the current cohort of young adults may face historically high cardiovascular disease risk and chronic disease burden. Our substantive investigation of the impact of neighborhood factors on chronic conditions will contribute further to the understanding of contextual influences on the health of this cohort at the forefront of a chronic disease epidemic. Moreover, the dramatic rise in overdoses, accidental poisonings, and mental health issues contributing to premature mortality warrants further investigation into risk-inducing environmental factors for substance abuse. Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics. Results can be utilized to inform population-based strategies to reduce health disparities and improve health. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The epidemic rise in obesity, related chronic diseases, and substance abuse in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. The development of the Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics with potential impact on health.

"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals. These novel ultrasound techniques will be initially applied to improve liver imaging in overweight and obese patients in a pilot study, though the benefits of this new high-quality imaging technology will extend to all other areas of clinical ultrasound imaging.",Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients,9885175,R01EB027100,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Weight', 'clinical imaging', 'elastography', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'liver imaging', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'simulation', 'sound', 'subcutaneous']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,590183,0.01668532306076002
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Pittsburgh Drug Discovery Institute (UPDDI) is requesting funds to purchase the Perkin Elmer OPERA PHENIX high speed, high resolution spinning disk confocal High-Content Screening (HCS) device. The Opera Phenix will replace two Molecular Devices ImageXpress Ultra high content readers purchased in 2008, which are critical to multiple NIH-, DoD-, and Foundation-funded projects at the University of Pittsburgh, but are no longer supported by the manufacturer and have been decommissioned. We have determined that one Opera Phenix instrument can replace the two IXUs. The Phenix is a third generation HCS instrument that will be essential to satisfy the diverse needs of users that the UPDDI serves. No comparable instruments exist at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Carnegie Mellon University. Over the last decade, HCS has become a standard in the pharmaceutical industry for target identification, phenotypic screening, as well as toxicology, and in academia for large-scale biological studies, where cell-by- cell quantitation is critical. The UPDDI has been an academic pioneer in the application of HCS and serves an extensive number of collaborators across campus that require and rely on HCS, ranging from neurodegeneration, organ regeneration, cancer, liver diseases, organotypic model development, and traumatic brain injury. Our diverse user groups’ needs emphasize discovery models of physiological relevance and high complexity, and therefore require fast, high resolution 2D, 3D, and kinetic imaging and maximum flexibility in image analysis. The large number of HCS users working in the UPDDI further demands a fast system to permit effective sharing of instrument time, and an integrated database with off-site user access to perform off- line analysis. Key requirements for an HCS imager therefore are superior speed in acquiring z-series of images at high resolution of thick specimens in aqueous matrices, mature yet flexible image algorithms, and seamless integration of instrument software with system, public,and custom-developed UPDDI databases. The only instrument that meets all of these criteria is the Opera Phenix because it has 1) fast laser-based illumination and the ability to acquire multiple channels simultaneously 2) water immersion objectives that eliminate non-matching refractive indices, which limit spherical aberrations of air and oil objectives at longer working distances and require adjustment of correction collars depending on imaging depth; 3) a powerful suite of user-friendly yet flexible image analysis routines including a 3D module, advanced texture and morphology analysis, and intuitive and user-friendly machine learning; and 4) the ability to perform seamless “adaptive high-resolution imaging”, i.e., pre-scanning a large area at low magnification, followed by automated “on-the- fly” switching to higher magnification to acquire high resolution images of user-defined regions of interest. The Opera Phenix is the only instrument on the market that is capable of fulfilling the demands of the University of Pittsburgh’s diverse drug discovery community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern drug discovery increasingly demands better and more disease relevant models and the ability to analyze them. High-content screening (HCS) has become indispensable in the analysis of such models as it permits the analysis of cells, their constituents, and interactions in their proper biological context. The third generation HCS instrument, Opera Phenix, produces the quality and quantity of data from cells, tissues and experimental animals that are required for computational and systems biological investigations, while at the same time providing the throughput needed for automated screening.",Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery,9935240,S10OD028450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academia', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Drug Industry', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immersion', 'Institutes', 'Intuition', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical center', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oils', 'Phenotype', 'Reader', 'Refractive Indices', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Water', 'aqueous', 'base', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'organ regeneration', 'physiologic model', 'screening', 'user-friendly']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,S10,2020,1010594,0.005545370490876186
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity.

"Center for Open Bioimage Analysis Project Summary  The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for sophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an indispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.  Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale, size, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of access to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri laboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open source bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the collaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training events and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in innovative ways to address new experimental areas.  Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under real­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects: deep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This work will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on these two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.  The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are accustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from biologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs reflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher expertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing the teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software projects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying the latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.  In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological problems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training the biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology. Project Narrative Biologists studying a huge variety of diseases and basic biological processes need software to measure cells, tissues, and organisms in microscopy images.

"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",10023935,U24EB029011,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Psychology', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'medical implant', 'open source', 'outreach', 'particle', 'patient population', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2020,256578,0.006261487289421466
"Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY  The morphologic and mechanical characteristics of a tissue are fundamental to understanding the development, homeostasis, and pathology of the human body. During the previous period of funding, we developed statistical shape modeling (SSM) methods and applied these to the study of structural hip disease. We also developed the initial framework to integrate SSM with finite element (FE) analysis to enable the study of shape and mechanics together. If incorporated into clinical practice, SSM and FE analysis could identify features of the anatomy likely responsible for injury, remodeling, or repair. Geometry needed for SSM and FE models is typically generated by segmentation of volumetric imaging data. This step can be painstakingly slow, error prone, and cost prohibitive, which hampers clinical application of these computational techniques. We have created a deep machine learning algorithm ‘DeepSSM’ that uses a convolutional neural network to establish the correspondence model directly from unsegmented images. In Aim 1 we will apply DepSSM to improve clinical understanding of structural hip disease by characterizing differences in anatomy between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; these morphometric comparisons will identify anatomic features most telling of disease, thereby guiding improvements in diagnosis. Computational advancements have simplified the process to generate patient-specific FE models, enabling clinically focused research. However, there is no framework to collectively visualize, compare, and interpret (i.e., post-process) results from multiple FE models. Currently, inter-subject comparisons require oversimplifications such as averaging results over subjectively defined regions. In Aim 2 we will develop new post-processing methods to collectively visualize, interpret and statistically analyze FE results across multiple subjects and study groups. We will map FE results to synthetic anatomies representing statistically meaningful distributions using the correspondence model. Statistical parametric mapping will be applied to preserve anatomic detail through statistical testing. We will use our published FE models of hip joint mechanics as the test system. Finally, volumetric images provide a wealth of information that is delivered to physicians in a familiar format. Yet, tools are not available to interpret model data with clinical findings from volumetric images. In Aim 3, we will develop methods that evaluate relationships between shape, mechanics, and clinical findings gleaned from imaging through integrated statistical tests and semi-automatic medical image annotation tools that utilize standard ontologies. Quantitative CT and MRI images of the hip, which estimate bone density and cartilage ultrastructure, respectively, will be evaluated as test datasets. To impart broad impact, we will disseminate our methods to the community as open source software that will call core functionality provided by existing, open source software that has a large user base (FEBio, ShapeWorks). PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed technology will provide the methodologies necessary to increase the clinical acceptance and applicability of computer models. These models measure three-dimensional tissue shape and estimate tissue mechanics, providing information that cannot be measured conventionally. We will implement these methods into software that can be used by the public free-of-charge.",Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics,9972694,R01EB016701,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Bone Density', 'Cardiology', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Glean', 'Grooming', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Pathology', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurology', 'Ontology', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'disease diagnosis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,563658,0.011389514389750085
"Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo 1 Dermatologists rely on visual (clinical widefield) and dermoscopic examination of skin lesions to guide the need  2 for biopsy. With this approach, sensitivity is high, but specificity tends to be quite variable and lower, resulting  3 in millions of biopsies of benign lesions every year. To improve specificity, several optical technologies are  4 being developed to noninvasively detect skin cancer. Of these, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is the  5 furthest advanced in clinical utility, proven for diagnosing skin cancers with high sensitivity and specificity.  6 RCM imaging, guided by dermoscopy, detects skin cancers with 2 times superior specificity, and reduces the  7 benign-to-malignant biopsy rate by 2 times, compared to that with dermoscopy alone. In 2016, the Centers for  8 Medicare and Medicaid Services granted current procedural terminology (CPT) reimbursement codes for RCM  9 imaging of skin. RCM imaging combined with dermoscopy is now advancing into clinical practice, sparing pa- 10 tients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. However, toward widespread acceptance and adoption, a 11 key challenge is that clinical widefield examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as 12 three separate procedures with separate devices. Clinicians do not precisely know the location of RCM imag- 13 es relative to the surrounding contextual lesion morphology that is seen with clinical widefield examination and 14 dermoscopy, resulting in lower and more variable diagnostic accuracy (particularly, sensitivity, positive and 15 negative predictive values). We propose a novel solution: (i) a new objective lens with an integrated micro- 16 camera, to deliver a concurrent widefield image of the skin surface surrounding the location of RCM imaging; 17 (ii) a new software algorithm for widefield image-based tracking of the location of RCM images within a dermoscopic 18 field of view; (iii) a new diagnostic approach that will proactively use widefield imaging to locate RCM images in 19 dermoscopic images. We intend to deliver this integrated widefield clinical, dermoscopic and RCM imaging ap- 20 proach into the clinic, toward a new standard for more accurate, consistent and faster RCM imaging to guide 21 patient care. Preliminary studies with a “mock” objective lens and micro-camera on a bench-top set-up 22 demonstrated excellent optical sectioning (~2 µm) and resolution (~1 µm) for RCM imaging, and accurate and 23 repeatable location of RCM fields-of-view within the widefield image. RCM images showed excellent cellular 24 and morphologic detail in vivo. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a handheld reflectance confocal micro- 25 scope with integrated widefield camera; (2) to develop image processing algorithms for real-time widefield im- 26 aging-guided tracking of RCM image locations within dermoscopic fields; (3) to test and validate performance 27 on 100 patients. Although our proposition is for skin lesions, the research will surely have wider impact for 28 imaging in other settings, particularly, with miniaturized confocal microscopes and endoscopes, which have 29 very small fields-of-view. We are a highly synergistic team from Montana State University, Memorial Sloan 30 Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.). RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Clinical examination and dermoscopy combined with reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging is a newly emerging optical imaging procedure that can noninvasively guide diagnosis of skin cancers, and reduce the need for biopsy. However, clinical examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as three separate procedures with separate devices, limiting effectiveness and impact. We propose a device to combine the three into a single procedure, which will help dermatologists and patients by making the skin examinations quicker, more accurate and more consistent, expanding the impact of this proven approach.",Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo,9860776,R01EB028752,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Current Procedural Terminology', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Dermis', 'Dermoscopy', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Engineering', 'Epidermis', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lesion', 'Lesion by Morphology', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicaid services', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Montana', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lens', 'medical specialties', 'microscopic imaging', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'optical imaging', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'routine practice', 'skin lesion', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY - BOZEMAN,R01,2020,649717,0.0027619443716700868
"Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) Summary. Our long-term goal is to develop a powerful tool based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for non- invasive human skin imaging in order to improve clinical diagnosis, guide effective treatment and advance clinical and cosmetic/pharmaceutical research by providing access to dynamic cellular and molecular processes during therapy. MPM is a nonlinear optical imaging technique that provides unique structural and molecular contrast based on endogenous signals such as second harmonic generation from collagen and two- photon excited fluorescence from NADH/FAD+, keratin, melanin and elastin fibers. This contrast allows MPM to provide multi-color, rich molecular information content images that can enhance diagnostic accuracy. MPM overcomes fundamental limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging and extends the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. Validation of the clinical potential of this technology has been facilitated over the past 10 years by a device developed by Jenlab in Germany, currently the only clinical MPM system on the market. This device has technical limitations in terms of field-of-view (FOV), imaging speed, complexity and cost, which are major barriers to clinical adoption. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a MPM system that is highly optimized for rapid, label-free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. The Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) imaging platform will incorporate the innovative optical engine of a benchtop prototype developed at BLI. InfraDerm will innovate on this design to transform it into a compact, portable device, suitable for human skin imaging in clinical setting. Key innovations include: 1) a compact engineering design based on integrating a compact fs fiber laser into the imaging head along with a customized folded optical design to reduce complexity and cost and enhance portability; 2) hardware and software strategies that include a customized patient interface and a combination of optical and mechanical scanning mechanisms with deep learning image restoration to allow millimeter-to-centimeter scale imaging within minutes while maintaining sub-micron resolution. This approach will expand the in vivo imaging area from mm to cm scale, which will be scanned within minutes with sub- cellular resolution. In Aim 1 we will develop the FLAME prototype that incorporates these features. In Aim 2 we will test its technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging by evaluating potential effects of motion artifacts. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the FLAME system potential for non-invasive assessment of melanin content, an ability with potential impact in differential diagnosis and early assessment of treatment efficacy of pigmentary skin disorders, such as melasma. Phase II will refine the technological approach and will test the device feasibility in a first clinical application, differential diagnosis of patients with melasma, a long time dermatology challenge and a particular interest for pharma companies developing therapies for this skin condition. Narrative  InfraDerm LLC proposes to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a laser scanning microscope based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) that addresses fundamental and technical limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging, extending the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. The proposed Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) prototype will be highly optimized for rapid, label- free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution.

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and affect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable of discovering local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest. The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects.

"A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to improve our ability to create and measure 3D models derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Our main motivation is to improve quality and reduce costs in care of patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities. The resulted innovations will also impact other fields. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffered from CMF deformities. The evaluation of these patients includes an assessment of CMF form on 3D models that are traditionally generated from segmented spiral multi-slice CTs (MSCTs). These models are also used to plan their treatment. The purpose of segmentation is to separate different anatomical structures and to remove the artifacts on the CTs. Once 3D models are generated from the segmented CTs, anatomical and teeth landmarks are manually digitized for measurements. Finally, diagnosis and treatment planning are performed based on measurements. Although MSCT provides high- quality images and thus allows relatively fast and easy post processing, many concerns have been raised on excessive radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, more doctors are now using CBCT scanners in their offices. CBCT has less radiation and is inexpensive compared to the MSCT, but their use in generating 3D models is greatly limited by the poor image quality, i.e., low contrast / signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts. Thus, the existing automated segmentation algorithms developed for MSCT are incapable of practically segmenting CBCTs. The current solution to CBCT segmentation entails an arduous and lengthy process that involves labor-intensive manual editing of hundreds of slices. Besides, another arduous and inaccurate task in the assessment of CMF deformities is the digitization of anatomical landmarks on 3D models - the first step to quantify the deformities. Currently a typical 3D cephalometric and teeth analysis requires the manual digitization of more than 200 landmarks, which is time consuming and has limited accuracy. We hypothesize that the creation and measurement of high-quality 3D models can be significantly improved by developing innovative CBCT-friendly post processing tools. Therefore, in this renewal project, we propose to develop and validate a novel CBCT analysis platform to automate the process of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization. The feasibility of our approaches has already been proven by our preliminary studies. Our innovative CBCT analysis platform will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals with CMF conditions. It will change our dental/CMF fields in effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for on-the-fly diagnosis and treatment planning. With minimal user intervention, the computer will accurately and effectively do the work, which is currently artistically done by the labor-intensive human operators. The resulted innovations may also impact other fields in the future, e.g., orthopedic surgery and cardiovascular surgery where intraoperative whole-body CBCT is acquired for image-guided surgery and intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in physician's offices for orthodontics, craniomaxillofacial (CMF) surgery, facial plastic surgery and dentistry, but its segmentation and landmark digitization have to be completed artistically by human operators, which is labor-intensive and with limited accuracy.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative CBCT post processing system to automate the processes of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization with minimal user intervention.  The proposed system will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals  with CMF conditions, and also change 1) the fields of orthodontics, CMF surgery and general dentistry in  effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for diagnosis and treatment planning, and 2) the fields of orthopedic  surgery, general surgery, and cardiovascular surgery where the quality and the speed of intraoperative imaging is critical.",A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities,9840832,R01DE022676,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Deformity', 'Dental Care', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Jaw', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Orthodontics', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'care costs', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'design', 'detector', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'segmentation algorithm', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,495143,-0.004920537307696824
"Human Tumor Atlas Network: Data Coordinating Center Supplement This proposal is a collaboration with the HTAN Data Coordination Center DCC and describes an Image Data Project aimed at developing and deploying the technology needed for storage, distribution and basic analysis of cell and tissue images collected by multiple HTAN Centers. Multiplexed tissue images are an important type of data for nearly all of the centers contributing to the HTAN (second only to single cell sequencing data in number of centers collecting data). However, the software needed to visualize, analyze, manage, and share multiplexed images of tissues and tumors is underdeveloped. The initial availability of SARDANA images has highlighted the challenges faced by HTAN, including the DCC, in deploying an infrastructure for distributing large and complex images. We therefore propose a two-year HTAN Image Data Project (IDP) led by the DCC and HMS PCA focused on the rapid development and deployment of image informatic systems and computational resources for image management and analysis. Our goal is to put in place a functional first-generation system no later than summer 2020 and to then steadily refine the system so that it becomes the backbone of cross-functional HTAN atlases. As a matter of necessity, we will start with informatic systems and software that are either available today or in a relatively advanced state of development. However, we expect to evaluate these choices throughout the IDP and change course as necessary to incorporate potentially superior approaches. We will also support the diverse needs and formats of centers using different data collection methods. Aim 1 will focus on the deployment and progressive improvement of a cloud-based database for image management based on the OMERO standard as well as a parallel system for access to primary data. Aim 2 will develop and deploy software for visualizing HTAN image data by the general public. The IDP will use the existing MCWG and DAWG mechanisms for oversight and reporting, and all centers will be invited to participate. Within IDP, the HMS PCA will take primary responsibility for initial deployment of image informatics software. The DCC and HMS will jointly undertake software development and code hardening, and the DCC will take the lead in user assistance and software deployment, particularly in year two. Images of tumor specimens obtained from biopsy or surgery are one of the primary ways in which cancer is diagnosed and staged by pathologists, but such images have typically lacked molecular detail. The highly multiplexed tissue images being collected by HTAN will fundamentally change this, and it is therefore essential that the data be efficiently and widely distributed. The HTAN Image Data Project IDP will address an acute need for software for data dissemination and visualization.",Human Tumor Atlas Network: Data Coordinating Center Supplement,10206514,U24CA233243,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Atlases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Client', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'European', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Performance', 'Reporting', 'Side', 'Slide', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cellular imaging', 'cloud based', 'computing resources', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multiplexed imaging', 'programs', 'relational database', 'single cell sequencing', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U24,2020,926364,0.030916974175889282

"Gaze-contingent computer screen magnification control for people with low vision ! Project Summary This application describes proposed research with the goal of facilitating use of a computer screen magnifier by people with low vision. Screen magnification is a well-established, popular technology for access of onscreen content. Its main shortcoming is that it requires the user to continuously control, with the mouse or trackpad, the location of the focus of magnification, in order to ensure that the magnified content of interest is within the screen viewport. This tedious process may be time-consuming and ineffective. For example, the simple task of reading the news on a web site requires continuous horizontal scrolling, which affects the experience of using this otherwise very beneficial technology, and may discourage its use, especially by those with poor manual coordination.  We propose to develop a software system that enables hands-free control of a screen magnifier. This system will rely on the user’s eye gaze (measured by a regular IR-based tracker, or from analysis of the images in a camera embedded in the screen) to update the location of the focus of magnification as desired. This research is inspired by preliminary work, which showed promising results with two simple gaze-based control algorithms, tested on three individuals with low vision.  This project will be a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz (PI: Manduchi, Co-I: Prado) and the School of Optometry at UC Berkeley (PI: Chung). Dr. Legge from the Department of Psychology at U. Minnesota will participate as a consultant. Two human subjects studies are planned. In Study 1 with 80 low vision subjects from four different categories of visual impairment, we will investigate the failure rate of a commercial gaze tracker (Aim 1), and will record mouse tracks, gaze tracks, and images from the subjects while performing a number of tasks using two modalities of screen magnification (Aim 2). In Study 2, with the same number of subjects, we will repeat the Study 1 experiment, but using a gaze-based controller trained from the data collected in Study 1, and individually tunable for best performance (Aim 3). In addition, we will experiment with an appearance-based gaze tracker that uses images from the screen camera, thereby removing the need for specialized gaze tracking hardware, as well as with a computer tablet form factor (Aim 4). We expect that reading speed and error rate using our gaze-based controller will be no worse than using mouse-based control. If successful, this study will show that the convenience of hands-free control offered by the proposed system comes at no additional cost in terms of individual performance at the considered tasks. ! ! Project Narrative People with low vision often use screen magnification software to read on a computer screen. Since a magnifier expands the screen content beyond the physical size of the screen (the “viewport”), it is necessary to move the content using the mouse so that the portion of interest falls within the viewport. This project will facilitate use of a screen magnifier by means of a new software system that relies on the user’s own gaze to control scrolling when reading with magnification. !",Gaze-contingent computer screen magnification control for people with low vision,10053172,R01EY030952,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Apple', 'Behavior Control', 'Benchmarking', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desktop Video', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magic', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Modality', 'Mus', 'Operating System', 'Optometry', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computer science', 'control trial', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gaze', 'human subject', 'interest', 'motor control', 'news', 'recurrent neural network', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'tool', 'web page', 'web site']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R01,2020,350753,-0.015494290511287432
"SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING EMAN is one of the most well-established and widely used scientific image processing suites targeting the rapidly growing CryoEM/CryoET community worldwide. In turn, the CryoEM and CryoET studies which it enables permit determination of the structures of interacting macromolecules both in-vitro and in-vivo, and are being used to better understand the biochemical processes taking place in cells, to better identify potential drug targets and develop novel diagnostics. With the higher resolutions now possible in this field, direct drug interaction structural studies are now possible, and being used to gain insight into the mode of action of drugs within the cell. Unlike many newer tools in the field, such as Relion, CisTEM and CryoSparc, which focus on specific refinement tasks, EMAN is a versatile, modular suite capable of performing a variety of image processing tasks with hundreds of algorithms supporting virtually all of the standard file formats and mathematical conventions used in the field, as well as other related imaging fields. It provides an ideal platform for prototyping fundamental new algorithm developments, while still able to achieve data-limited resolution in single particle reconstruction. While high resolution single particle refinement has become routine in recent years, thanks largely to the dramatic data quality improvements provided by new detector technology, there remain significant opportunities for improvements in mitigating model bias, efficient use of data, and analysis of complexes with compositional or conformational variability. Some of the most important problems from a biological perspective involve the sort of compositional and conformational variability which remain challenging problems. The field also remains susceptible to problems of initial model bias, which are exacerbated in systems exhibiting structural variability, and as a result many structures are still published with exaggerated resolution claims. The standard protocols used by many in the field typically involve discarding a very large fraction of the raw data (as much as 80-90% in some cases), often based on qualitative assessments, raising questions related to rigor and reproducibility of structural results. In this proposal, we will develop or adapt image processing techniques to help resolve these issues, based on developments or unrealized concepts from mathematics and computer science. CryoEM and CryoET are used to study the structures of interacting biomolecules in the cell at resolutions 100x better than the best possible light microscope. This methodology permits new insights into the biomolecules which underlie disease, can shed light on structural changes in diseased cells and provide direct information on how drugs interact with the molecules they target.

"Fully-Automated Lesion Characterization in Ultrawide-Field Retinal Images Abstract  In this grant application we propose to develop, EyeReadUWF, a fully automated tool for lesion characterization in ultra-widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images. In recent times non mydriatic UWF SLO imaging has been shown to be a promising alternative to conventional digital color fundus imaging for grading of diabetic eye diseases, with advantages including 130°-200° field-of-view showing more than 80% of the retina in a single image, no need for multiple fields, multiple flashes, or refocusing between field acquisitions, ability to penetrate media opacities like cataract, and lower rate of ungradable images. UWF SLO images are particularly suitable for detecting predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. Accurate quantification of presence and extent of PPLs can only be done by a robust automated tool that is specifically designed for the pseudo-colored images of UWF SLO modality. EyeReadUWF will automatically characterize lesions in pseudo colored UWF images while handling possible artifacts from eyelashes/eyelids and determine the lesion predominance in peripheral and central regions of UWF image. The ability to accurately quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions in UWF SLO images can enable clinicians to develop a more precise DR scoring scheme. This would help identify patients with higher risk of DR progression and onset of PDR, have a positive impact on diabetic patient management, and aid drug discovery research. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeReadUWF, will perform automated lesion characterization in ultra- widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images to quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. To the best of our knowledge, no commercial automated analysis tool is currently indicated for UWF SLO images. Once clinically validated, the tool can enable clinicians to triage patients with higher risk of DR progression and onset of PDR, have a positive impact on diabetic patient management, and aid drug discovery research.",Fully-Automated Lesion Characterization in Ultrawide-Field Retinal Images,10082348,R44EY028081,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Blindness', 'Cataract', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Color', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyelash', 'Eyelid structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Lasers', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Localized Lesion', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'screening program', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2020,1000000,-0.012984285664844787
"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. The proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways that biological specimens are examined by allowing 3-D structural and functional imaging of suspending cells at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or 2-D imaging.",3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry,10023268,R21GM135848,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Hematological Disease', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Laboratory Organism', 'Leukocytes', 'Lifting', 'Lighting', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Records', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'digital', 'feature extraction', 'fluorescence imaging', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'lens', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'software development', 'targeted imaging', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tomography']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2020,155784,-0.01813541559254094
"2020 OSA Optical Coherence Tomography Meeting NIBIB PROPOSAL – ABSTRACT 2020 OSA Optical Coherence Tomography Meeting  Biophotonics technologies have clear medical and clinical applications. However, the transformation and translation from the research lab to the clinic, and then to market is a complex process. The 2020 OSA Optical Coherence Tomography meeting will be held on 20-23 April 2020 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in parallel with other four topical meetings (Clinical and Translational Biophotonics, Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy, Microscopy, Histopathology and Analytics, Optics and the Brain) within the same congress, the 2020 OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics. The ultimate objective of this conference is to disseminate recent developments in the field of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and inspire new ideas through various forms of interactions within a broad audience that includes engineers, natural scientists (physicists, biologists, chemists, etc.), clinical researchers, industrial R&D and market experts. The meeting will report on the latest advances in this field and discuss how the OCT field can be advanced in the near future. In addition to addressing the use of adaptive optics to improve image quality, emphasis will be placed on advanced techniques to use OCT for functional imaging, real time volumetric imaging and rendering, and imaging for diagnostic and surgical guidance applications. New topics to be covered are the development and application of advanced image processing algorithms to interpret to imaging data.  A unique advantage of co-locating this meeting within a congress and presenting joint plenary sessions is the extended cross-fertilization between experts in in the distinct but synergic fields.

"Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries Project Summary: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. Advancing a tool such as an electrode, injection pipette or optical fiber through a small hole in the cranium, sometimes over long distances, and placing it precisely in a particular brain area, often much less than one millimeter in diameter, is a significant experimental challenge. Any time an investigator misses the target brain area and the experiment fails as a result, a significant amount of work is lost, additional animals get sacrificed, materials are wasted, and the pace of scientific discovery has been slowed. Even in cases when experiments succeed, they can be difficult to reproduce because many research groups rely on their most experienced lab members and their “special touch” to perform these procedures – thereby adding an element of non- quantitativeness to the procedures, effectively making the experiment less reproducible. We propose to develop a novel stereotaxic apparatus which will overcome many of these shortcomings. Our device features a radically different mechanical design which is natively compatible with both traditional and novel in-vivo techniques. We propose to combine computer 3D vision and robotics for automatic and software guided adjustments of the animal's skull. Landmarks are measured with 3D vision, based on structured illumination at a level of accuracy that has not been accomplished by any of the existing devices. This information will guide a robotic platform to position the animal for the experiment. Finally, we propose to develop an open software platform for neuronavigation that will allow investigators to use the platform with any small animal species they desire to use. Brain atlas systems for neuronavigation can either be downloaded from a cloud based site, or produced de-novo by the investigator by preparing a single set of MRI and CT scans from one sample animal. Our device will help make stereotaxic procedures more accurate and less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Narrative: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. These devices will help make stereotaxic procedures less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Most importantly, they will help reduce or eliminate failed experiments due to mistargeted interventions, thereby accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.",Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries,10080673,R41NS119079,"['3-Dimensional', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Monitor', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age group', 'base', 'bone', 'bone imaging', 'brain tissue', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cranium', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic strain', 'hexapod', 'in vivo', 'laboratory experience', 'member', 'millimeter', 'novel', 'operation', 'optical fiber', 'programs', 'prototype', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'wasting']",NINDS,POPNEURON LTD.,R41,2020,251960,-0.007490297938384819
"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level. This project will fill the gap between in vitro and in vivo toxicology testing with an effective invertebrate model organism as alternate to vertebrate animal testing.",A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing,10082215,R44MH118841,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dendrites', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Eating', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gel', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immobilization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Market Research', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research Activity', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Serotonin', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic neuron', 'computational platform', 'connectome', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'design', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'developmental toxicity', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'fluorescence imaging', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'graphical user interface', 'high resolution imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotoxicology', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'reproductive toxicity', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'terabyte', 'testing services', 'young adult']",NIMH,"NEWORMICS, LLC",R44,2020,749858,0.007740468212399678
