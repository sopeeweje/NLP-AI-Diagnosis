"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9765031,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Acute', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Period Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'bacterial genome sequencing', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'enteric pathogen', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'health care settings', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,728162,0.13633637939345147
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9792242,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2019,1308373,0.08762737158308831
"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice; develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results",EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics,9902000,U01HG008679,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'County', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Economic Models', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Familial disease', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Safety', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'case finding', 'chronic rhinosinusitis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'implementation research', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized health care', 'phase 3 study', 'phenome', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational genomics', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2019,730148,0.16278294922709186
"EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eMERGE III Clinical Center proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank, clinical data in the electronic medical records (EMR) for >4 million participants from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise and state-of-the-art genetic analysis. We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing. Finally, we will participate in all Network activities to enhance the movement of genetics into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery and clinical use of genetic variants associated with both rare Mendelian and more common complex diseases promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE III project will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the phenotypic impact of mutations emerging from sequencing and then return results on selected variants to Biobank participants using a clinical trial.",EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE,9882457,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Callback', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consent', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Custom', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'LDLR gene', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Mediating', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mining', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutation', 'New England', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'TYK2', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'actionable mutation', 'arm', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'implementation research', 'loss of function', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'pilot trial', 'pleiotropism', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'rare variant', 'support tools']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2019,800708,0.11179336646669726

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice; develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results",EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics,9515974,U01HG008679,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'County', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Economic Models', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Familial disease', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Safety', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'case finding', 'chronic rhinosinusitis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'implementation research', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized health care', 'phase 3 study', 'phenome', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational genomics', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2018,871212,0.16278294922709186
"EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eMERGE III Clinical Center proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank, clinical data in the electronic medical records (EMR) for >4 million participants from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise and state-of-the-art genetic analysis. We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing. Finally, we will participate in all Network activities to enhance the movement of genetics into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery and clinical use of genetic variants associated with both rare Mendelian and more common complex diseases promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE III project will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the phenotypic impact of mutations emerging from sequencing and then return results on selected variants to Biobank participants using a clinical trial.",EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE,9493516,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Callback', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consent', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Custom', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'LDLR gene', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mining', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutation', 'New England', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'TYK2', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'actionable mutation', 'arm', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'implementation research', 'loss of function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'pilot trial', 'pleiotropism', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'rare variant', 'support tools']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2018,953224,0.11179336646669726
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9357523,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Acute', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Period Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disorder prevention', 'enteric pathogen', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,725048,0.13633637939345147
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9370683,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2017,1276741,0.08762737158308831
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies. This PheWAS proposal will develop new methods to identify detailed phenotypes and diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations,9332465,R01LM010685,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Catalogs', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'rare variant', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,458957,0.1260956090199147
"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.

We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing.

"Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for observational research. More recently, huge efforts have linked EMR databases with archived biological material, to accelerate research in personalized medicine. EMR- linked DNA biobanks have identified common and rare genetic variants that contribute to risk of disease. An appealing vision, which has not been extensively explored, is to use EMRs-linked biobanks for pharmacogenomic studies, which identify associations between genetic variation and drug efficacy and toxicity. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within EMRs make them ideal for quantifying drug outcome (both efficacy and toxicity). Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large-scale studies of treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. Despite its success, EMR-based pharmacogenomic studies are often hampered by its data-intensive nature -- it is time- consuming and costly to extract and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous EMR databases, for large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System. I2b2 has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to repurpose existing EMR data for clinical and genomic discovery. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop new methods to extract and model drug exposure and outcome information from EMR and integrate them with the i2b2 NLP components; 2) Build ontology tools to normalize and integrate pharmacogenomic data across different sites; 3) Conduct known and novel pharmacogenomic studies to evaluate and refine tools developed in Aim 1 and 2; and 4) Disseminate the developed informatics tools among pharmacogenomic researchers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) linked with DNA biobanks have become valuable resources for genomic and pharmacogenomics research, allowing identification of associations between genetic variations and drug efficacy and toxicity.

"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9214494,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Acute', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disorder prevention', 'enteric pathogen', 'falls', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,762222,0.13633637939345147
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies. This PheWAS proposal will develop new methods to identify detailed phenotypes and diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations,9128740,R01LM010685,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Exclusion', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'rare variant', 'software development', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,473040,0.1260956090199147
"Semi-supervised learning with electronic medical records Project Summary/Abstract The implementation of electronic medical record (EMR) systems in routine healthcare has resulted in a rich and inexpensive source of data for translational research. When linked with specimen biobanks, these extensive databases offer a unique opportunity to accelerate the goals of disease genomics as they contain large amounts of detailed clinical and genetic data collected for the purposes of medical care [4; 6; 7; 8; 9]. However, the statistical methods to analyze EMR data are limited and thus the focus of this proposal.  In particular, extracting accurate disease phenotype information is a major challenge impeding EMR-based research [10]. Currently, ICD9 codes are used to conﬁrm presence or absence of a disease in cohorts derived from EMRs. These codes are extremely variable and therefore have a signiﬁcant impact on the statistical power of genetic studies [11; 12]. An alternative approach is to develop a highly accurate algorithm to classify disease status. But due to the laborious medical record review required to obtain validated phenotype information for classiﬁer estimation, phenotypes are only available for a small training set nested in a large cohort. In contrast, predictors of phenotype are available for all observations. To improve accuracy and efﬁciency in model estimation and evaluation, it is therefore of interest to develop semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods that utilize the so- called unlabeled data or observations without conﬁrmed phenotype status in addition to the labeled training set.  Although a great body of literature on SSL exists, nearly all methods concern estimation of classiﬁers or prediction rules when the labeled training set is a simple random sample from the large unlabeled data set [13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21]. Despite the practical importance of evaluating the prediction performance of an estimated model, no SSL procedures currently exist to improve the estimation of model performance parame- ters. Additionally, the simple random sampling assumption is restrictive and the development of semi-supervised (SS) methods that accommodate more ﬂexible sampling schemes in the context of both model estimation and evaluation is needed.  In this proposal, these limitations are addressed through formulation of an efﬁcient method to estimate various prediction performance measures including the ROC curve within the traditional SS framework of simple random sampling. The stratiﬁed random sampling design in the SS setting is also considered and methods to estimate a classiﬁer and its accuracy are developed. These procedures will be applied to EMR-based studies of bipolar disorder and depression. The success of this work will thus improve efﬁciency in analyzing EMR data and expedite the use of EMRs in clinical and genetic research in neuropsychiatry. Project Narrative  The use of electronic medical records (EMRs) in routine healthcare has generated a rich source of data for in-depth study of disease risk factors. However, EMR data typically consists of a very small number of expensive observations with information on disease status and a large amount of automatically extracted data concerning risk factors such as laboratory results and previous health history. Statistical methods that accommodate this data structure are limited and thus the focus of this proposal.",Semi-supervised learning with electronic medical records,9192096,F31GM119263,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data structure', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'success']",NIGMS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2016,34098,0.11252349859265255
"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient. The main idea underlying the approach is that patterns of past EMR usage patterns can be exploited to selectively highlight clinically useful patient data.",Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System,9144440,R01LM012095,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemoglobin', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer human interaction', 'data access', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'stem', 'trend', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,424376,0.19042915190015855
"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.

"EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eMERGE III Clinical Center proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank, clinical data in the electronic medical records (EMR) for >4 million participants from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise and state-of-the-art genetic analysis. We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing. Finally, we will participate in all Network activities to enhance the movement of genetics into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery and clinical use of genetic variants associated with both rare Mendelian and more common complex diseases promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE III project will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the phenotypic impact of mutations emerging from sequencing and then return results on selected variants to Biobank participants using a clinical trial.",EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE,9134764,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Callback', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consent', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Custom', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'LDLR gene', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mining', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutation', 'New England', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'TYK2', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'implementation research', 'loss of function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'pilot trial', 'pleiotropism', 'premature', 'randomized trial', 'rare variant', 'support tools']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2016,953224,0.11179336646669726
"Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for observational research. More recently, huge efforts have linked EMR databases with archived biological material, to accelerate research in personalized medicine. EMR- linked DNA biobanks have identified common and rare genetic variants that contribute to risk of disease. An appealing vision, which has not been extensively explored, is to use EMRs-linked biobanks for pharmacogenomic studies, which identify associations between genetic variation and drug efficacy and toxicity. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within EMRs make them ideal for quantifying drug outcome (both efficacy and toxicity). Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large-scale studies of treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. Despite its success, EMR-based pharmacogenomic studies are often hampered by its data-intensive nature -- it is time- consuming and costly to extract and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous EMR databases, for large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System. I2b2 has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to repurpose existing EMR data for clinical and genomic discovery. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop new methods to extract and model drug exposure and outcome information from EMR and integrate them with the i2b2 NLP components; 2) Build ontology tools to normalize and integrate pharmacogenomic data across different sites; 3) Conduct known and novel pharmacogenomic studies to evaluate and refine tools developed in Aim 1 and 2; and 4) Disseminate the developed informatics tools among pharmacogenomic researchers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) linked with DNA biobanks have become valuable resources for genomic and pharmacogenomics research, allowing identification of associations between genetic variations and drug efficacy and toxicity. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System, has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to use existing EMR data for genomic knowledge discovery of diseases. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by developing new natural language processing, ontology components, and user-friendly interfaces, and then apply these tools to real-world pharmacogenomic studies.",Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data,9068953,R01GM103859,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anthracyclines', 'Archives', 'Award', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug toxicity', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heparin', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'Institution', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Link', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vancomycin', 'Vision', 'Warfarin', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clopidogrel', 'data integration', 'disorder risk', 'drug efficacy', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'large-scale database', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'rapid growth', 'rare variant', 'response', 'study population', 'success', 'surveillance study', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,536892,0.1662712770661205
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies.

The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice; develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results                ",EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics,8968014,U01HG008679,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'County', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Economic Models', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Safety', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'case finding', 'chronic rhinosinusitis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'implementation research', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phase 3 study', 'phenome', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'systems research', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2015,899776,0.16278294922709186
"EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eMERGE III Clinical Center proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank, clinical data in the electronic medical records (EMR) for >4 million participants from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise and state-of-the-art genetic analysis. We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing. Finally, we will participate in all Network activities to enhance the movement of genetics into clinical practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery and clinical use of genetic variants associated with both rare Mendelian and more common complex diseases promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE III project will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the phenotypic impact of mutations emerging from sequencing and then return results on selected variants to Biobank participants using a clinical trial.                ",EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE,8968123,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Callback', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consent', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Custom', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'LDLR gene', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mining', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutation', 'New England', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'TYK2', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'implementation research', 'loss of function', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'pilot trial', 'pleiotropism', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'rare variant', 'tool']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2015,972425,0.11179336646669726
"Outpatient Adverse Drug Effect Alerting System Using Admission H&P Notes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will create, test, implement, and evaluate a real-time Adverse Drug Effect (ADE) alerting system at Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH). Utilizing information extracted from admission history and physical examination notes (H&Ps) stored in the electronic medical record (EMR), our system will detect adult inpatients' previously unrecognized symptomatic ADEs and alert appropriate care providers. The project will create an ADE knowledge base, mined from multiple publically available sources including MEDLINE, RxNorm, and the product labels for human prescription drugs. Next, we will apply natural language processing (NLP) to EMR-based H&P texts to identify mentions of patients' current medications and dosages. We will similarly detect EMR-based H&P documentation of patients' clinical manifestations (CMs - diseases, symptoms, findings, etc.), and then represent them using the Unified Medical Language System's (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). The system will then compare each patient's recognized medications and CMs against the aforementioned ADE knowledgebase, generating appropriate patient-specific alerts for potential adverse effects related to the patient's current medications. Each alert will identify the offendin medication, the suspected nature of the ADE, and evidence supporting the assertion. We will independently evaluate the accuracy of the ADE knowledgebase using expert manual review and comparison to multiple other sources. Before implementing the real-time ADE monitoring system, we will conduct a pilot implementation using retrospective EMR data from the Vanderbilt Synthetic Derivative (SD), a de-identified version of the Vanderbilt EMR. After successful testing and any necessary iterative improvements, we will implement the real-time detection system at VUH, initially monitoring newly admitted inpatients presenting to the Internal Medicine service. Using the methods described above, the system will detect potential ADEs each time a new inpatient H&P is generated, and alert appropriate clinicians via additions to an existing dashboard that the clinicians already utilize. We will survey clinicians immediately upon receipt of an ADE alert to determine if the alerting condition was already known or not, whether the alert seems plausible, and whether it requires intervention. Then we will compare discharge medications to admission medications to determine what actions occurred post-alert, independent of physician survey results. We will thus evaluate both the effectiveness of the system in improving ADE recognition and its perceived usefulness according to the physician-subjects. We hypothesize that our system will improve clinicians' awareness of ADEs in a manner applicable to any facility that stores admission H&Ps electronically. Addressing previously unrecognized ADEs has the potential to reduce costs and improve patient care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unrecognized adverse drug effects (ADEs), a serious clinical problem, cause preventable hospitalizations, increase healthcare costs, and worsen health outcomes. To potentially improve quality of care, my dissertation project will develop and evaluate a novel system to detect adult inpatients' previously unrecognized symptomatic ADEs and alert appropriate care providers. Using automated natural language processing of clinician-generated electronic admission history and physical exam (H&P) notes and a locally-developed ADE knowledgebase derived from publically available sources, the system, once validated, could improve both recognition and treatment of ADEs in a generalizable manner - applicable in hospital environments using electronic medical records.            ",Outpatient Adverse Drug Effect Alerting System Using Admission H&P Notes,8796404,R36HS023485,[' '],AHRQ,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R36,2015,41626,0.05198173430464869
"Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for observational research. More recently, huge efforts have linked EMR databases with archived biological material, to accelerate research in personalized medicine. EMR- linked DNA biobanks have identified common and rare genetic variants that contribute to risk of disease. An appealing vision, which has not been extensively explored, is to use EMRs-linked biobanks for pharmacogenomic studies, which identify associations between genetic variation and drug efficacy and toxicity. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within EMRs make them ideal for quantifying drug outcome (both efficacy and toxicity). Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large-scale studies of treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. Despite its success, EMR-based pharmacogenomic studies are often hampered by its data-intensive nature -- it is time- consuming and costly to extract and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous EMR databases, for large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System. I2b2 has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to repurpose existing EMR data for clinical and genomic discovery. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop new methods to extract and model drug exposure and outcome information from EMR and integrate them with the i2b2 NLP components; 2) Build ontology tools to normalize and integrate pharmacogenomic data across different sites; 3) Conduct known and novel pharmacogenomic studies to evaluate and refine tools developed in Aim 1 and 2; and 4) Disseminate the developed informatics tools among pharmacogenomic researchers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) linked with DNA biobanks have become valuable resources for genomic and pharmacogenomics research, allowing identification of associations between genetic variations and drug efficacy and toxicity.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.             Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies.

"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology. Completion of the aims will reveal new, medically useful markers, improve the linking of high-throughput genomic methods to EMR data, and develop policies and practices for bringing individualized evidence-based medicine to communities.

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information.

"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology. Completion of the aims will reveal new, medically useful markers, improve the linking of high-throughput genomic methods to EMR data, and develop policies and practices for bringing individualized evidence-based medicine to communities.

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying  factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal  treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological  research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public  records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained.  Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at  hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data  source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the  wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical  information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that  information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as  selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical  methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for  observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing  EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient  manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will  contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based  information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information  from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to  analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the  standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the  capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost.   The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to  extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and  use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both case-  control and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon  cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two  major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our  study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Project Narrative  According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various  types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it.

"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology. Completion of the aims will reveal new, medically useful markers, improve the linking of high-throughput genomic methods to EMR data, and develop policies and practices for bringing individualized evidence-based medicine to communities.       RELEVANCE (See instrucfions): To advance personalized medicine-treatment and preventive care based on individual traits; this project matches small differences in DNA to infectious disease susceptibility and response to statins, serotonin- specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and blood pressure medications.

"An insilico method for epidemiological studies using Electonic Medical Records Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying  factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal  treatments for diseases, such as cancers.

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors.

"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology. Completion of the aims will reveal new, medically useful markers, improve the linking of high-throughput genomic methods to EMR data, and develop policies and practices for bringing individualized evidence-based medicine to communities.       RELEVANCE (See instrucfions): To advance personalized medicine-treatment and preventive care based on individual traits; this project matches small differences in DNA to infectious disease susceptibility and response to statins, serotonin- specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and blood pressure medications.

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. We will develop tools to incorporate genomic information in the EMR. In addition, we will investigate clinical, translational, and ethical aspects of genetic testing for complex diseases and assess the response of patients to genetic testing.              n/a",EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations,8193561,U01HG006379,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bioethics', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic library', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiologist', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Myopathy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'community consultation', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'experience', 'fitness', 'genetic risk assessment', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'heart disease risk', 'interest', 'open source', 'point of care', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHGRI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2011,788498,0.13322069546027132
"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Narrative: According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs.

"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses.

The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7427367,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'concept', 'data modeling', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MED CTR,U01,2007,1463449,0.18282941379786463
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy).

"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.

"Optimizing the Utility of Large Electronic Health Records Data in Data-Driven Health Research Optimizing the Utility of Electronic Medical Records Data in  Data-driven Health Research ABSTRACT Medical centers continue to archive patient follow-up data in Electronic Medical Records (EMR), which have tremendous value in discovering new knowledge and insights. The large volume of EMR data can play an important role in improving the accuracy and generalizability of predictive models in healthcare, especially when misdiagnosis is known to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. Despite these merits, EMR data are invariably corrupted by factors like missing values, outliers, and unrealistic measurements, which prevent researchers from fully utilizing such abundant data in many important studies. Many studies simply discard a large number of samples to get rid of missingness and eventually bias their data-driven analytical models. Existing techniques for missing data imputation use simplified linear models and are mostly suitable for imputing cross-sectional data missingness that ignore longitudinal missingness in patient follow-up data. This proposal aims to investigate novel artificial intelligence (AI) based models to improve the quality and utility of EMR data in preparation for data-driven retrospective studies. Toward this preparation, the goal of the project is 1) to investigate more accurate and robust data imputation models compared to existing ones and 2) adapt state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in preparing optimal representation of large EMR data. The proposed research will 1) maximize the quality and utility of EMR data to support a multitude of retrospective studies, 2) enable visualization of complex patient data, 3) identify more important and predictive clinical parameters, 4) yield a compact and optimal representation of large EMR datasets. We hypothesize that optimally processed EMR data with state-of-the-art AI models can most accurately model patient risk when compared to existing statistical and clinical risk models. This project will combine the complementary expertise of the collaborators, Dr. Manar Samad, PhD (Computer Science), Dr. Owen Johnson, DPH (Biostatistics and Public Health), and Dr. Edilberto Raynes, MD, PhD (Medicine) along with the participating undergraduate students at Tennessee State University (TSU). The proposal entails several research and development components that will allow undergraduate students to gain valuable research and analytical skills in data science, programming, and health informatics. The project activities will expose health science students to AI-based computing solutions to broaden their scope of future health research and career. This project will help TSU prepare a strong workforce of minority students who will gain competitive skill sets in data science and health informatics that are currently high in demand almost everywhere. Overall, the project will develop a data-capable workforce to strengthen an interdisciplinary research capacity and collaboration between the Departments of Computer and Health science at TSU. Project Narrative Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data are invariably corrupted by data missingness and data redundancy that limit their application in many valuable data-driven research studies aiming to achieve the goals of precision medicine. This project aims to develop a number of innovative computational frameworks that will optimally prepare and utilize EMR data to facilitate research studies with relevance to patient risk modeling, discovery of new health markers, and patient-specific prognosis and therapeutic strategy. The project will leverage recent advances in machine learning and data science by involving an interdisciplinary team of researchers consisting of three faculty members, two graduate students, and four undergraduate students, which will establish a data-centric research collaboration between the Departments of Computer and Health Science.",Optimizing the Utility of Large Electronic Health Records Data in Data-Driven Health Research,10111205,R15LM013569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Tennessee', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'career', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'complex data ', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'data quality', 'data structure', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'minority student', 'neural network', 'non-linear transformation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'research study', 'skills', 'structured data', 'survival prediction', 'undergraduate student']",NLM,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2020,421700,0.11895953828651168
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9984252,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Models', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella aerogenes', 'Klebsiella oxytoca', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Period Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'acute care', 'bacterial genome sequencing', 'base', 'budget impact', 'cost', 'data mining', 'economic evaluation', 'enteric pathogen', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'health care settings', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial genomics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,728162,0.13633637939345147
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,10005116,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2020,1316550,0.08762737158308831
