"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers. Through SPEEDe, we will develop an innovative machine- learning approach for accurately detecting adverse events in the elderly in real-time.",Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe),9711286,R01AG062499,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'detector', 'forging', 'hands-on learning', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,802341,0.011210147955894145
"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9750722,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,527585,0.03209154586243992
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9735365,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,302394,0.015839144582570085
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,0.029853032644666246
"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments.

"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,9816677,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic wound', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Healing', 'Wound Infection', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,542166,-0.007323850471932801
"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9772486,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'coronary event', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2019,1524688,0.025628331973823363
"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing.

"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9540043,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,304104,0.015839144582570085
"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9560840,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'coronary event', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2018,2667664,0.025628331973823363

The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9355417,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,302394,0.015839144582570085
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated.

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions.

"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,9452250,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nephrotoxic', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2017,169044,0.015788946636267415
"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9241579,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'model building', 'network models', 'novel', 'research study', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,409580,0.03209154586243992

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,8934878,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Control Locus', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2015,2836708,0.025628331973823363
"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.

"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             n/a",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,7791405,K25AI064625,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bioterrorism', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,K25,2010,113132,0.10250893420912968
"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients.

"Mining Internet Conversation For Evidence Of Herbal Association    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events Abstract This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10), Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Informatics for Post- Marketing Surveillance. Often, users of online resources such as discussion boards seek advice about topics they are hesitant to discuss with providers. One such topic is the use of herbal supplements. Relatively little is known about the use and effects of these supplements, primarily due to patient and provider reticence, but also owing to the lack of a formal reporting mechanism. As a result, adverse events and interactions possibly related to herbal use are difficult to evaluate in a population-based investigation. The potential impact for monitoring side effects and adverse events associated with herbal use as well as prescription drug interactions with herbals is highly important. The goal of this project is to develop, apply, and evaluate computational intelligence tools for mining conversational text for evidence of adverse events and side effects of herbals and prescription drugs reported by users of online communication resources relating to breast and prostate cancer. This project will use these informatics tools as the cornerstone of a new approach to post-marketing surveillance, and has been determined by the National Library of Medicine to be responsive to the stated Challenge Topic. This project will be conducted at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, which contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, the School created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity. This project will create or retain eight jobs. The School's ability to fill these positions is evident: in 2008, Penn received more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open staff research positions.

"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels.

"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers. Through SPEEDe, we will develop an innovative machine- learning approach for accurately detecting adverse events in the elderly in real-time.",Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe),10093288,R01AG062499,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'detector', 'forging', 'hands-on learning', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NIA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,705459,0.011210147955894145
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9935103,R01HD092239,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'acute care', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,302394,0.015839144582570085
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,0.029853032644666246
"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays.

"Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Summary: Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Current investigation of mechanisms underlying many diseases relies on the acquisition of multi-dimensional genomics data. The utility of these data is, however, offset by the lag in development of tools and models to fully interrogate them. In the context of infectious diseases, such data contains molecular information including gene transcription, regulation, and variations from both the infecting pathogen and the host cell, providing a snapshot of the host and pathogen interactions (HPIs). These HPIs determine infection outcomes. For instance, when a pathogen evades, or evolves resistance to defensive host immunity via a multifaceted HPI, it can result in persisting infection, chronic inflammation, malignant transformation, and/or elevated mortality. Recent successes in overcoming immune-evasion of infected tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the clinical gains that can be made by identifying and specifically targeting essential mechanisms of HPIs. Hence, precisely identifying new mode(s) of HPIs is critical for development of effective and personalized interventions. The molecular mechanisms of HPIs underpinning disease can be identified from genomics data. For example, information on whether a transcription factor (TF) regulates genes from either host or pathogen, or both, can be captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of infected host cells. This means that integrative analysis of genome-scale data can provide a platform for large-scale and unbiased detection of often multi- dimensional and novel facets of HPIs in host cells. However, there is a lack of data mining tools and models to extract such information. More importantly, the available analysis tools typically focus on data from either the host or the pathogen and not on the interactions occurring between the two, excluding us from investigating the full HPI spectrum. Thus, novel methods to determine HPIs by simultaneously modeling both host and pathogen data are critical for understanding key cellular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies. My lab specializes in developing computational models to construct HPI maps and to experimentally validate them. As proof-of-principle, we produced a comprehensive HPI map from sequencing samples from large numbers of tumors caused by Epstein–Barr virus. This map delivered unprecedented insights, identifying novel viral integrations, mutations linked to viral reactivation and providing molecular classification of tumors expected to yield individualized cancer therapy. Therefore, my lab is uniquely positioned to uncover mechanistic insights from HPIs. Our program seeks to develop new models and machine learning tools to construct HPI maps in several diseases by focusing on the following major questions: 1) how do expression, integration, and mutational landscapes of host and pathogen affect pathogenesis of disease?; 2) what is the nature of physical HPIs and cross-regulation by major host and pathogen factors that modulate gene expression, such as TFs and RNA binding proteins?; 3) how do HPIs define molecular subtypes to guide personalized treatments? We expect to identify novel HPIs and provide systems-level understanding of mechanisms critical to cell biology. Narrative Understanding how host cells and pathogens interact is key to developing new and individualized therapeutics. Here, we will develop novel computational tools and models to analyze existing and newly generated high throughput data and construct multi-dimensional host pathogen interaction maps. These maps will provide detailed mechanisms underpinning multi-faceted interactions occurring between host and pathogen and will delineate molecular subtypes that can be utilized for novel and personalized treatment options.",Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics,10028454,R35GM138283,"['Affect', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Classification of Tumors', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Integration', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'effective intervention', 'genome analysis', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'lens', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIGMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,381824,0.00854358080270298
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9973004,R01DK101674,"['Ablation', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cresol', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Ecosystem', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Process', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Sulfate', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Uremia', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'colon microbiota', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human subject', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstitution', 'solute', 'tool', 'translation to humans']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,690557,-0.005819279462182522
"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,9994848,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'data pipeline', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncology trial', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2020,169884,0.015788946636267415
"Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage ABSTRACT Despite major eradication efforts over the past century, malaria remains a significant world-wide health burden. Plasmodium vivax poses the greatest obstacle to malaria eradication due to its ability to form dormant stages within the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites can reactivate weeks to years after the initial infection, leading to relapses, and can only be targeted by two licensed drugs with extensive side effects and toxicity that limits their use. Models of disease prevalence suggest that even a modest reduction of hypnozoite abundance in the liver could make a major impact on the spread of disease. All Plasmodium parasites that have been extensively studied have been shown to rely on specific host signaling events for invasion and development through liver stage infection. These host factors represent potential targets for host-based interventions. Unfortunately, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding the host factors that permit Plasmodium vivax liver stages to persist and develop, in large part because of technical challenges associated with growing the parasite and then monitoring host signaling events in rare infected cells. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by using two approaches, kinase regression and digital spatial profiling, to interrogate host-driven phosphosignaling in P. vivax-infected hepatocytes, including those that harbor hypnozoites. If successful, our approach will identify host kinases that are necessary for P. vivax developing and dormant liver stages, as well as phosphosignaling that is altered by infection. These data will dramatically enhance our understanding of host factors that regulate Plasmodium vivax liver infection, and in doing so provide insight into the cellular niche that promotes liver-stage parasite development and dormancy. In addition to enhancing the understanding of this largely mysterious process, this information could inform host-directed therapies, which represent a novel approach to targeting dormant malaria parasites. NARRATIVE Malaria kills approximately half of a million people annually. One of the major hurdles to malaria eradication is the ability of Plasmodium vivax to form hypnozoites, dormant liver stages that can remain within the host for years and lead to relapses. This proposal seeks to assess host factors that change upon, and are necessary for, P. vivax developing and dormant parasites, with the long-term goal of using this information to eliminate relapsing malaria.",Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage,10056490,R21AI151344,"['Antibodies', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Onset of illness', 'Parasites', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Plasmodium yoelii', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sporozoites', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vivax Malaria', 'base', 'differential expression', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'liver infection', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'side effect', 'small hairpin RNA', 'small molecule']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,281780,0.023960753462145854
"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,9989920,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired healing', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Infection', 'Wound models', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic ulcer', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial genomics', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'tissue-repair responses', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,511458,-0.007323850471932801
