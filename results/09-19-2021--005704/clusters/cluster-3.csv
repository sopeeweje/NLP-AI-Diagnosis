"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.

"A novel human T-cell platform to define biological effects of genome editing PROJECT SUMMARY Genome editing technologies have extraordinary potential as new genomic medicines that address underlying genetic causes of human disease; however, it remains challenging to predict their long-term safety, because we do not know the consequences of potential side effects of genome editing such as off-target mutations or immunogenicity. Our long-term goal is to understand and predict such unintended biological effects to advance the development of safe and effective therapies. T-cells are an ideal cellular model because: 1) they are highly relevant as the most widely used cells for development of therapeutic genome editing strategies (such as cell-based treatments for HIV and cancer) and 2) mature T-cells encode a diverse T-cell receptor repertoire that can be exploited as built-in cellular barcodes for quantifying clonal expansion or depletion in response to specific treatments. We, therefore, propose the following specific aims: 1) to predict which unintended editing sites have biological effects on human T-cells by integrating large-scale genome-wide activity and epigenomic profiles with state-of-the-art deep learning models and 2) to develop a human primary T-cell platform to detect functional effects of genome editing by measuring clonal representation, off-target mutation frequencies, immunogenicity, or gene expression. If successful, our experimental and predictive framework will profoundly increase confidence in the safety of the next generation of promising genome editing therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Genome editing technologies have extraordinary potential as the basis of new genomic medicines that address the underlying genetic causes of human disease; however, it is challenging to predict their long-term safety, because we do not know the consequences of potential unintended side effects of genome editing such as off-target mutations or immunogenicity. To define the biological effects of genome editing strategies, we will develop a human primary T-cell platform to sensitively detect functional effects coupled with an empirically-trained artificial intelligence models to predict them.

"Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation Project Summary  It is now possible to readily identify sequence variants that have been subject to natural selection in human populations. Adaptive variants have been shown to underlie diversity in both disease risk and morphology across human populations, suggesting that the lens of evolution remains a powerful tool for understanding human biology, yet one that is currently underutilized. One challenge to realizing this potential is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, as are most signals of selection and variants associated with human phenotypic traits. Mutations modifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites in non- coding, cis-regulatory regions are hypothesized to be more amenable to driving phenotypic evolution than coding changes. These cis-regulatory regions are major determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and variation within enhancers has been indicated to play role in selection and disease. However, enhancer `regulatory grammar' – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with TFs to control gene expression, is poorly understood. The challenge of linking a regulatory variant under selection to an adaptive phenotype is similar to that facing disease association studies: the targeted gene, cell type, and biological process are often unknown, hindering further investigation.  Machine learning algorithms automate the discovery of patterns, making them well-suited to uncover sequence constraints and the combinatorial TF binding patterns of enhancers without relying on limited motif databases. I will optimize support vector machine classifiers to elucidate regulatory grammar from over 100 cell types and tissues. These models will be used to predict the impact of sequence variants on cis-regulatory sites, expanding the utility of the NHGRI's ENCODE and Roadmap projects. I will then apply these tissue- specific predictions to signals of selection and/or disease from the NHGRI's 1000 Genomes Project and its genome-wide association studies catalog. By describing the regulatory impact of signals of selection, I will globally describe patterns of functional adaptation across populations, identifying genes, and gene networks targeted by selection and/or disease. I will functionally characterize variants using massively parallel reporter assays and genome editing to give deeper insight into specific cases of evolution relevant for human health.    This project seeks to develop tools and resources to describe the structure and function of sequence variation in the human genome. This proposal seeks to vastly increase the number of elucidated cases of human evolution, and specifically characterize those adaptive variants associated with disease. We will share the functional regulatory predictions for the use in interpreting a broad range of genomic datasets. This work has broad implications, from interpreting genetic variants in populations and understanding functional targets of evolution, to prioritizing non-coding mutations for precision genomic medicine and beyond. Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to describe the tissue-specific effects of regulatory variants using machine learning algorithms, and then integrate these functional predictions with signals of selection and/or disease association in order to pinpoint genetic variants important for human evolution and health.",Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation,9614325,F32HG009226,"['Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional adaptation', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'interest', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'precision genomic medicine', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'trend', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,46114,0.021291808185621378
"Inferring selection from human population genomic data Project Summary/Abstract Identifying genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation is a major challenge in population genetics. Particularly in humans, the task of confidently detecting the action of recent adaptive natural selection (or positive selection) has proved troublesome. Indeed there is considerable controversy over whether recent positive selection has a substantial impact on human genetic variation. The work proposed here will address this problem by creating a more complete map of positive selection across many human populations, identifying selection on de novo mutations as well as selection on previously standing variation.  Specifically, the proposed research seeks to construct a scan for positives election that is more robust and accurate than any currently existing methods (Aim 1). This tool will utilize supervised machine learning techniques allowing it combine information from a number of existing tests for natural selection, and will be tested extensively on a large suite of population genetic simulations presenting a wide range of potentially confounding scenarios. This tool will then be released to the public. Next, it will be applied to 26 human populations in which a large sample of genomes have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Aim 2), revealing similarities and differences in the tempo, mode, and targets of adaptive evolution across human populations. Finally, because selection on both beneficial and deleterious mutations skews genetic variation, our method will be used to identify regions of the genome least affected by natural selection, which will in turn be used to produce more accurate inferences of human demographic histories (Aim 3).  The mentored phase of this work will be performed within the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University. This is an intellectually stimulating environment with numerous journal clubs, an excellent seminar series, and several other research groups using computational techniques. The project will be performed under the stewardship of Dr. Andrew Kern, from whom the candidate will also receive training in machine learning and population genetics. Dr. Schrider will also receive training in population genetics and guidance from Dr. Jody Hey (Co-mentor) at nearby Temple University. This training will help Dr. Schrider acquire skills that will aid not only in the completion of the proposed work but also his transition to principle investigator of an internationally recognized independent research program studying the evolutionary forces driving patterns of human genetic variation. Project Narrative Detecting genes underpinning recent human adaptation remains a major challenge, and such genes are often associated with human disease. The work proposed here seeks to use supervised machine learning techniques to detect genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation across 26 different human populations. This work will also clarify human population size and migration histories, information that has implications for the prevalence of disease-causing mutations and efforts to identify them.",Inferring selection from human population genomic data,9666926,R00HG008696,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'International', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'disease-causing mutation', 'driving force', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human population genetics', 'learning strategy', 'population migration', 'pressure', 'programs', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R00,2019,242725,0.023841235366022607
"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease",9625746,U01HG009431,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome Mappings', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Repression', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'expression vector', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'personalized genomic medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'software development', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,620335,0.0807969233600326
"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation. Recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques has allowed us to look beyond the nucleotide sequence of DNA and investigate the principles of higher-order chromatin organization.

"Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes Komor – Project Summary/Abstract - “Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes”  While targeted genome editing, the introduction of a specific modification in genomic DNA, has the potential to allow researchers to study and better understand mechanisms of human genetic diseases, traditional genome editing methods (including CRISPR-Cas9) that rely on the initial introduction of double stranded DNA breaks (DSB) suffer from modest genome editing efficiencies as well as unwanted gene alterations (indels), particularly when attempting to correct point mutations. Recently, a class of genome editing agents called single base editors was developed that does not involve DSBs, but rather uses a dCas9-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) modifying enzyme to directly chemically modify target nucleobases within a ~5 nucleotide window determined by the protospacer. Two classes of editors have been developed that use cytosine and adenine deamination chemistries to catalyze the conversion of C•G base pairs to T•A (CBEs), and A•T base pairs to G•C (ABEs), respectively. Here we propose the development and characterization of new base editors capable of facilitating new point mutations using methylation chemistry. We have use a bioinformatic approach to identify RNA modifying enzymes that have the potential to be repurposed into new base editors, and have rationally designed mutant libraries to use with directed evolution to convert these enzymes into base editors (Aim 1). Concurrently, we are developing a machine learning program that utilizes existing ssDNA modifying enzymes to identify putative mutations that will expand the substrate scope of the identified methyltransferases to ssDNA (Aim 2). Mutations identified from both strategies will then be tested and characterized for base editing in multiple orthogonal systems (Aim 3). The successful completion of the proposed work will represent a significant addition to existing base editing technologies, and will enable researchers to cleanly and efficiently install two additional types of point mutations into the genome of living cells, allowing researchers to quickly and effectively general model systems for the study of human genetic diseases. Komor – Project Narrative - “Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes” Base editing enables high efficiency genomic point mutation introduction in a variety of cell types and has the potential to allow researchers to better study human genetic diseases.

"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9753292,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'learning network', 'men', 'next generation sequence data', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,468156,0.040553138853142524
"The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic variants that disrupt the functionality of regulatory sequences, and thereby alter gene expression levels, are major contributors to both evolutionary divergence between species and differences in risk for complex disease among humans. However, due to the complexity of the gene regulatory programs encoded in mammalian genomes and their rapid turnover between species, evaluating the function of non-protein-coding mutations is challenging. This is a major roadblock to tracing the evolution of human-specific biology. In addition, since the majority of disease-associated variants are non-coding, it impairs our ability to map the genetics of complex disease.  The long-term mission of my lab is to interpret the complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the human genome and accurately model the effects of genetic mutations to these elements on phenotypes relevant to disease and human evolution. We work toward these goals by integrating cutting-edge machine learning, statistical modeling of evolution, and the analysis of genotypes and phenotypes from large-scale clinical biobanks. In particular, my lab is uniquely well positioned to build on our previous work to address the following fundamental questions:  1. How have evolutionary transitions on the human-lineage modified the genome—in particular gene  regulatory programs—to produce human-specific biology? And how do these modifications relate to  human-specific disease risk?  2. What are the combinatorial rules underlying how TF binding patterns specify precise control of gene  regulation? And how do these gene regulatory “programs” evolve between species?  3. How do genetic and epigenetic mechanisms interact to specify the dynamic gene regulatory programs  that drive cellular development? And how are these programs perturbed in disease?  4. How can we interpret non-protein-coding mutations identified in patient genomes to inform treatment  and preventative care? Our work will produce much-needed methods for understanding the effects of mutations to gene regulatory regions and identify mutations responsible for differences in disease risk between human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The genetic mutations that distinguish humans from other great apes and that influence risk for complex disease are mostly found outside of genes. Many of these mutations influence when and where genes are expressed. However, we do not know how to interpret the effects of most such mutations on gene regulation, disease risk, or human evolution, we will develop computational models that leverage machine learning, evolutionary patterns, and large-scale clinical biobanks to identify mutations that disrupt proper control of genes and lead to disease.",The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease,9673749,R35GM127087,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'To specify', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cellular development', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'mammalian genome', 'programs', 'species difference']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2019,392270,0.04728511859339339
"Evolutionary Human Genomics: Demography, Natural Selection, and Transcriptional Regulation To be fully understood, the human genome must be considered in the context of evolution. The activities that have dominated human genomics for three decades — such as genome sequencing and annotation, interrogation with high-throughput biochemical assays, and the identification of associations between genetic variants and diseases — have been enormously informative, but these descriptive studies must eventually be understood within the theoretical framework of evolutionary genetics. We must continue to press forward from the what? to the why? and how? of human genetics.  The goal of my laboratory is to interpret high-throughput genomic data from an evolutionary perspective. Drawing from ideas and techniques in molecular evolution, population genetics, statistics, and computer science, we aim both to understand the evolutionary forces that have shaped human genomes, and to use evolution to shed light on the phenotypic importance of particular sequences. Our recent activities have focused in three major areas: (1)  reconstruction  of  features  of  human  evolution  based  on  genome  sequences;  (2)  prediction  of  the  fitness consequences  of  human  mutations;  and  (3)  the  study  of  transcriptional  regulation  and  its  evolution  in primates.   We have reported major findings in each of these areas, including the existence of gene flow from early modern humans to Eastern Neandertals, a map of fitness consequences for mutations across the human genome, and an analysis showing that the architecture of transcription initiation is highly similar at enhancers and promoters in the human genome.  Here we propose to extend our research substantially in each of these areas, working together with a broad range  of  experimental  and  theoretical  collaborators.    Our  new  goals  include  the  development  of  improved methods for reconstructing human demography, with a focus on ancient gene flow; extensions of our ancestral recombination graph (ARG) sampling methods to accommodate much larger samples sizes, with applications in association mapping and the detection of natural selection; two complementary machine-learning approaches for  improving  the  prediction  of  fitness  consequences  from  sequence  data;  an  experimental  collaboration  to leverage CRISPR-Cas9 screens in characterizing noncoding mutations; a multi-pronged study of the sequence determinants of RNA stability and their implications for the evolution of transcription units; and development of a new probabilistic model for turnover of regulatory elements.  Together, these projects will address a wide variety of fundamental questions about the function and evolution of sequences in the human genome. Vast quantities of genomic data are now available to describe patterns of genetic variation within  human populations and across species, and various measures of biochemical activity along the human  genome. These data need to be interpreted in light of the fundamental forces of mutation,  recombination, natural selection, and genetic drift that have shaped genetic variation. This  proposal describes a series of projects that make use of new computational, statistical, and  theoretical methods to address fundamental questions in human evolutionary genetics, including how  humans arose   from our archaic hominin and ape cousins, how human populations diverged from one  another, how new mutations influence human health and fitness, and how regulatory sequences  contribute to unique aspects of human biology.","Evolutionary Human Genomics: Demography, Natural Selection, and Transcriptional Regulation",9658531,R35GM127070,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Enhancers', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Primates', 'RNA Stability', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'computer science', 'fitness', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome annotation', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'promoter', 'reconstruction', 'statistics']",NIGMS,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R35,2019,479215,0.06382234753349283
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages.

"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9751141,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2019,1186500,0.03748735527252945
"Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing A major result from recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) is that the majority of genetic variants driving common human diseases lie in regulatory, rather than protein-coding, regions. Massive efforts to map epigenomic features such as localization of histone modifications (HMs) and transcription factors (TFs) have paved the way toward understanding the regulatory genome. However, dissecting the impact of an individual non-coding variant remains an unsolved challenge.  A variety of computational methods have been proposed, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies and machine learning techniques. However, these methods still do not provide conclusive information about causality of any specific non-coding mutation and lack gold-standard experimental results for evaluation. Several techniques are used to experimentally test the impact of individual regulatory variants. For example, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) synthesize thousands of oligonucleotides encoding mutated versions of putative regulatory elements placed in plasmids upstream of reporter genes. However, a major limitation is that tested sequences are outside of their endogenous chromosomal locus, and hence do not necessarily provide physiological relevance.  CRISPR enables targeted editing of genomic DNA. Indeed, CRISPR is widely used, but studies of individual point mutations have been primarily on a small scale and are usually limited to a handful of variants or to a single gene. The major throughput challenge in studying a specific variant using genome editing is in tying genotype to phenotype. Introducing individual mutations exhibits low efficiency, and thus there is a need for enrichment of the genotype or phenotype of interest prior to assessing the impact of a mutation on a phenotype, such as gene expression. Current enrichment methods either disrupt the physiological context or are low throughput. Recent efforts overcame these challenges using pooled editing to analyze thousands of mutations simultaneously, but were limited to variants in protein coding regions.  This proposal aims to develop a novel technique merging multiplexed genome editing of putative regulatory variants followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding variants on regulatory potential in their native genomic context. The key insight of the proposed approach is that mutations impacting epigenomic features can be measured both in genomic DNA and in phenotypic readouts such as ChIP-seq of TFs or HMs, avoiding the need for a selection step to connect genotypes with phenotypes. ​Aim 1 develops the pooled editing technique on a pilot set of previously validated regulatory variants. ​Aim 2 scales this approach to interrogate thousands of mutations at once. ​Aim 3 integrates experimental predictions with state of the art machine learning methods to evaluate and optimize computational methods for regulatory variant effect prediction. Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of genetic changes in the population contributing to common human diseases, such as schizophrenia, heart disease, and diabetes, lie in regions of the genome that do not code for proteins, but rather regulate the expression of genes. Despite massive efforts to map regulatory regions across dozens of human cell types, it is still difficult to predict the effect of an individual non-coding mutation. This project develops a high-throughput genome editing technique to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding mutations on regulatory potential in their native genomic context, with the ultimate goal of interpreting genetic changes leading to human disease.",Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing,9761568,R21HG010070,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Allelic Imbalance', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Fraction', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HNF4A gene', 'Heart Diseases', 'HepG2', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasmids', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2019,236250,0.04845487658451298
"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",9699641,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic agent', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Embryonic Development', 'Estrogens', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'biophysical model', 'gene interaction', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neurogenomics', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'social', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2019,356979,0.024804070761270933
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased.

"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is to catalog all functional elements in the human genome through the integration and analysis of high-throughput data. We propose to continue the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, DAC) which will provide support and leadership in analyzing and integrating data from the ENCODE project as well as work closely with other ENCODE groups including the Data Coordination Center. Our proposed DAC team (Zhiping Weng, Mark Gerstein, Manolis Kellis, Roderic Guigo, Rafael Irizarry, X. Shirley Liu, Anshul Kundaje, and William Noble) has expertise across a wide range of fields including transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, evolution, genomics and proteomics, regulatory RNA, biophysics, and computational biology, where they are the leaders in machine learning, statistical genetics, networks, and gene annotation. These investigators also have a history of successfully working collaboratively in large consortia, particularly with other ENCODE groups. Their publication records demonstrate their synergistic approach to producing high-impact science and useful resources that benefit the broader biomedical communities. The proposed DAC will pursue the following four aims: Aim 1. Analyze and integrate data and metadata from a broad range of functional genomics projects; Aim 2. Serve as an informatics resource by supporting the activities of the ENCODE Analysis Working Group; Aim 3. Create high-quality Encyclopedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes; Aim 4. Assess quality and utility of the ENCODE data and provide feedback to NHGRI and the Consortium.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9766882,UM1HG009435,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'K-562', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2019,1497668,0.08600164618479822
"Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Myosins are a diverse and ubiquitous class of molecular motors that are responsible for generating much of the macroscopic force in the human body. The human genome encodes 38 different isoforms of myosin, and members of this group act as force sensors or generators for a diverse set of processes throughout the body. To serve this wide array of functions, each myosin isoform has been biophysically tuned for its physiological role. In fact, the tuning is so precise that missense variants in one myosin isoform, !-cardiac myosin, can cause a congenital cardiomyopathy that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in people under 30. And yet, it is unknown how particular variants cause disease, or how to infer the pathogenic potential for novel mutations.  Large differences in functional properties between myosin isoforms are not the result of large differences in coding sequence or overall topology. Neither foreknowledge of phylogeny nor crystal structure is sufﬁcient to predict an isoform's biophysical properties. Furthermore, mutations causing disease frequently occur in regions of the protein far from the site of their deleterious effects. Poor understanding of the biophysical regulation of motor function has hampered the development of pharmaceuticals and the interpretation of human genomic data.  My goal is to establish a mechanistic understanding of myosin motors that is capable of predicting if and how sequence variation changes biophysical properties and can cause cardiac disease. Since myosin kinetics are not apparent from sequence or overall structure, they must be determined by other factors. I hypothesize that kinetic differences result from differences in the allosteric networks in these proteins. Allosteric network in this context refers to the coordinated conformational ﬂuctuations that give protein regulation the appearance of action at a distance. To test this hypothesis, we will use our unique combination of enormous computational power for molecular simulation and cutting-edge machine learning tools for analyzing protein allostery.  Aim 1 is to identify the biophysical determinants of myosin isoforms' differing speeds. To test our hypothesis that allosteric networks are responsible for modulating dynamics, I will use molecular simulations of different myosin isoforms and compare their allosteric networks with biochemical data about their properties. Aim 1 directly addresses outstanding questions about normal molecular-biological function of the heart, putting it in line with NHLBI overarching objective #1.  Aim 2 is to determine the difference, at atomic resolution, between healthy and diseased !-cardiac myosin. I hypothesize that the pathogenicity of variants with an unknown molecular etiology is a consequence of allosteric disruption, and will use our computational tools to test this hypothesis by simulating a set of known-pathogenic variants. This aim uses techniques from data science to understand the genetic determinants of health, and will apply equally well to rare alleles in under-represented groups as to majority groups. It is directly addresses NHLBI overarching objectives #3, #4, and #7. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Myosins are a closely-related group of molecules that are responsible for generating much of the force in the human body, including the heartbeat, the movement of limbs, and driving food through the stomach and intestines. Small changes to the myosin genes can have large effects: in healthy people, these give rise to different myosins that perform different functions, and mutations in some myosin genes can give rise to diseases that cause of sudden cardiac death. This proposal aims to learn, at the level of atoms and interatomic bonds, why and how these subtle changes to the myosin gene can create such large effects in the protein's function.",Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations,9678589,F30HL146052,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Appearance', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Cardiac Myosins', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Catalysis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Congenital cardiomyopathy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Etiology', 'Food', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Intestines', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Motors', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Myosin ATPase', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient risk', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Resolution', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solvents', 'Speed', 'Stomach', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'computerized tools', 'disease-causing mutation', 'genomic data', 'heart function', 'improved', 'insight', 'limb movement', 'member', 'millisecond', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'rare variant', 'rat Ran 2 protein', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,30442,-0.011301212917688205
"Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging Project Abstract Although genome instability has long been considered as one of the major causal factors of aging, little is known about the actual number of genome alterations per cell and their effects on aging organisms, most notably humans. In the research proposed here I will take a single cell approach to identify the most common types of somatic mutations, i.e., base substitutions, small INDELS, copy number variation, genome structural variation and retrotranspositions, in human B lymphocytes as a function of age. The overarching goal is then to estimate functional effects of these DNA mutations accumulated during human aging in this particular cell type, which will also serve as a model for studying somatic mutations and their consequences in other cell types. This could never be tested before, because it was never possible to analyze random somatic mutations in a tissue by sequencing bulk DNA from that tissue (mutations are low- abundant), I will achieve this goal by utilizing a new, single-cell, whole genome sequencing (SCWGS) protocol that we developed. In this project I will focus on human B lymphocytes from individuals varying in age from about 30 to over 100 years and determine the genome-wide frequency and location of the different types of mutations in multiple cells from each individual (Aim 1). Preliminary results already show a significant increase of both base substitution mutations and CNVs with age, with a substantial number of these mutations in B cell genomic regions that are potentially functional. Hence, in Aim 2 I will predict the actual functional effects of these potentially functional, age-related mutations using machine learning approaches and integrative network analysis. Finally, in Aim 3 I will empirically test these predictions as to whether the mutation loads observed affect B cell's ability of response to stimulus. Hence, to test the long-standing hypothesis of genome instability as a causal factor in aging ,I will determine age-related mutations in single cells at four levels: (1) number of mutations, mutation spectra and genome distribution in individual cells; (2) potential functional effects of individual mutations, i.e., non-synonymous mutations in exons and mutations in gene regulatory regions; (3) mutations collectively affecting the gene regulatory network; and (4) relationship between mutation load and B cell activation status. In summary, the results of the proposed project will, for the first time uncover possible direct functional effects of somatic mutations on cellular function. Project Narrative Genome instability is considered as one of the major factors of aging and age-related diseases. This research aims to study somatic DNA mutations in normal blood cells (B lymphocytes) of humans of different ages and evaluate the functional effect of these mutations. It will dramatically improve the knowledge of DNA mutations in aging and deepen the understanding of genome instability as a basic aging mechanism in human.",Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging,9785353,K99AG056656,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centenarian', 'Code', 'Collecting Cell', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication Damage', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA amplification', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Locus Control Region', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA amplification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrotransposition', 'Role', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Cell', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'crosslink', 'dietary restriction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'promoter', 'repair enzyme', 'repaired', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single cell technology', 'theories', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,135945,0.05510261964389401
"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,9762140,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,513500,0.02015226837195027
"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology.

"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community.

"Deep learning-based approach to identify non-coding cancer drivers that alter chromatin conformation Summary Most variants obtained from tumor whole-genome sequences (WGS) occur in non- coding regions of the genome. Although variants in protein-coding regions have received the majority of attention, numerous studies have now noted the importance of non- coding variants in cancer. Identification of functional non-coding variants that drive tumor growth remains a challenge and a bottleneck for the use of whole-genome sequencing in the clinic. Cancer drivers are generally identified by the high frequency at which their mutations occur across patients. However, mutation rate is highly heterogeneous in non- coding regions and many non-driver elements show higher mutation frequency than others, such as regions bound by transcription factors in melanoma or regions replicating late during cell division in colon cancer. In this proposal, we will use high- throughput pooled CRISPR screen and novel computational methods to predict non- coding cancer drivers. We will quantitatively measure the impact of thousands of non- coding mutations using our innovative high-throughput CRISPR screen that directly ties modifications in the native context of the non-coding genome (i.e. not a reporter assay) to a cancer relevant phenotype (cell growth). The results of the screen will be used as training data for the development of NC_Driver, a computational cancer driver prediction tool. NC_Driver will integrate the signals of high functional impact with the recurrence of variants across multiple tumor samples to identify the non-coding mutations under positive selection in cancer. We will identify drivers in promoters, enhancers and CTCF insulators. CTCF insulators are the most mutated yet least studied regulatory elements in the cancer genome. Using this integrative experimental and computational approach, we will identify high-confidence candidate drivers. Finally, we will perform functional evaluation of prioritized non-coding drivers in colorectal and prostate cancers. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in patient-derived cell cultures to test 20 high-ranking candidate driver promoter/enhancer/insulator mutations. Overall, this proposal addresses the critical need to identify drivers in the non-coding genome and over long- term enable the maximal benefit of genome sequencing for each patient. Project Narrative Cancer genomes contain thousands of mutations but only a few of them play an important role in cancer proliferation and are called drivers. Most of the mutations occur in regions of the genome that do not make proteins, yet the majority of previous studies have focused on protein-coding regions.

"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9740714,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,312660,0.014943109052637503
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy. By providing functional annotation of natural and disease mutations in tyrosine kinases, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of mutated tyrosine kinases for drug discovery and personalized therapy.",Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases,9731524,R01GM114409,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Survival', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Drug resistance', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tyrosine', 'Tyrosine Kinase Domain', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computer framework', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive test', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2019,300000,0.02043575090098464
"A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer genomes typically harbor a substantial number of somatic mutations. Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE While coding cancer driver mutations have been characterized in detail over the past decade, the contribution of noncoding mutations to tumor formation remains - apart from few examples (e.g. mutations in TERT promoters) - largely unknown. Recently, large-scale whole-genome sequencing datasets have been made available, but a major bottleneck for the biological and clinical interpretation of these cancer whole-genome cohorts is the lack of statistical models that identify driver mutations in noncoding regions. We developed a new statistical approach that characterizes driver mutations based on their surrounding nucleotide context in coding regions, and herein we propose a concrete plan to generalize our computational model to noncoding regions, apply our model to aggregated whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients (PCAWG, HMF datasets), and define the noncoding driver and passenger mutational landscape for biological discovery and focused clinical application.",A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions,9825986,R21CA242861,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Attention', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Untranslated RNA', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenicity', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predicting response', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'reference genome', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2019,232291,0.05197834112382766

"Linking human enhancers to predictive models of mRNA abundance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A central challenge in understanding the genetic origins of disease is the inability to isolate which regions of the genome are functionally responsible for the aberrant expression of genes. To date, nearly 85% of identified disease-causing mutations lie within protein-coding exons (i.e. the “exome”), which comprises 2% of the human genome. Yet an estimated 50-75% of Mendelian disorders, and an even greater proportion of non-Mendelian (i.e. polygenic) diseases, have unexplained genetic etiologies which are suspected to involve genetic variants in the remaining 98% of the human non-coding genome. Over the past 5 years, new genome-scale technologies have uncovered the existence of ~400,000 enhancer-like regions. Mutations in these regions are suspected to be a major source of the misregulation of gene expression levels, which can in turn manifest in disease. Nevertheless, the vast majority of these regions have never been directly tested for their ability to activate transcription, nor have they been definitively linked to the regulation of target genes. The K99 training phase of this award entails the development of a new generation of massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) technologies that can interrogate the functional activity of 10,000-100,000 enhancers with high precision and reproducibility, an order of magnitude more than is currently possible (Aim 1). Coordinated with this effort will be the quantitative modeling of biological determinants that are predictive of enhancer activity (Aim 2). Complementing Aims 1 and 2 is the development of models designed to infer enhancer-promoter regulatory interactions. Towards this goal, self-attentive models, derived from the field of computational linguistics, will be trained to learn how the epigenetic marks and transcription factor binding events associated with distal enhancers contribute to gene expression levels in a diversity of cell types (Aim 3). As this work transitions into the R00 independent phase of the award, deep convolutional neural networks will be trained to learn how underlying DNA sequences encode epigenetic and transcription factor binding information. This would thereby generate a mathematical function which links DNA sequence directly to gene expression levels, which would help to predict how specific genetic variants in distal enhancers might perturb the mRNA levels of target genes. These predictions will help to inform—at single nucleotide resolution—which genetic variants identified by genome-wide association studies are causally linked to disease (Aim 4). Collectively, these aims will give insight into the cis-regulatory logic encoded in DNA that specifies mRNA abundance. The methods developed herein will lay a quantitative framework with which to evaluate enhancer function, prioritize which genetic variants are likely to be associated with disease, and shed light onto the elusive functions of the non-coding regions of the human genome. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goals of this project are to develop a technology that can measure the activity of >10,000 enhancers in parallel, and to devise quantitative models that describe the impact of enhancers on gene expression levels. Achieving these goals will give insight into the cis-regulatory logic encoded in DNA that specifies mRNA abundance. We anticipate that these methods will shed light upon the elusive functions of non-coding regions in the human genome, and help to dissect the molecular origins of diverse genetic diseases.",Linking human enhancers to predictive models of mRNA abundance,9804719,K99HG010662,"['Address', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'convolutional neural network', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'model design', 'model development', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'reconstruction', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,1,0.011407969037380889
"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome. Project Narrative Certain genetic diseases are thought to be caused by mutations in the DNA that alter the expression of nearby genes. This project will help us to understand how DNA sequence regulates the expression of genes, and aims to apply this knowledge to predict how and why mutations change gene expression and contribute to disease.

"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9653955,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,587448,0.05661179793253587
"Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants Project Summary  We are now able to routinely sequence human genomes at single-base resolution. However, our ability to interpret the functional consequences of detected mutations has lagged behind. Computational approaches scale well but have poor accuracy, whereas retrospective analysis of detected variants has high accuracy but does not scale well. In order to solve this problem, a new experimental paradigm has emerged to empirically characterize the effects of mutations with high accuracy at scale. This approach takes advantage of recent and ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and has the potential to offer unprecedented insight into protein biochemistry and human disease. We believe these insights will prove to be critical for unlocking the potential of genomic medicine.  In this project we seek to comprehensively assess multiple molecular effects of PTEN mutations on protein function, and assess the utility of this data as a predictor for human clinical phenotype. The PTEN protein is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in the germline of some individuals with overgrowth disorders, cancer predisposition syndromes, or autism. Currently, it is impossible to predict the effects of the vast majority of PTEN germline mutations. Since the phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutation carriers is broad, it would be highly valuable to understand the ways in which phenotypic outcomes arise from PTEN mutation genotypes.  In Aim 1, we will first employ a yeast-based screen to assess the effects all PTEN single amino acid mutations on lipid phosphatase activity, the primary biochemical function of PTEN protein. It is known that several pathogenic variants are destabilized. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will perform a second, independent screen to assess the steady state protein stability of all PTEN single amino acid mutations. In Aim 3, we will use the data derived from this study as well as publically available biochemical information to train a classifier model to predict the relationship between the mutation genotypes and clinical phenotypes observed in humans. These data will increase our fundamental understanding of PTEN function and the role of mutations in diverse disorders, and could provide a valuable clinical tool that would increase the quality of life for PTEN mutation carriers. Project Narrative  Mutations in the gene PTEN are causal for a diverse set of clinical disorders ranging from cancer to autism spectrum disorder. Here, we seek to gain new fundamental insights into the functional relationships between PTEN mutations and clinical presentations by prospectively characterizing the effects of all single amino acid PTEN mutations in parallel. These data will allow the creation of new models that can predict risk of specific PTEN mutations for different clinical outcomes and potentially lead to personalized therapies, early interventions, and optimal outcomes for PTEN mutation carriers.",Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants,9794010,F31HD095571,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'PTEN protein', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitination', 'Variant', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'accurate diagnosis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genomic signature', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutation carrier', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein function', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'tumorigenic']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,0.0011412487263610823
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9654772,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'functional/structural genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,9737246,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stem cells', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2019,336177,0.01427583792590661
"Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs PROJECT SUMMARY Short peptides (10-100aa) are important regulators of physiology, development and metabolism, however their detection is difficult due to size and abundance. A stunning 30% of annotated human smORF genes include disease-associated variants mapped within exons, compared to 15% of human genes in general. Further, many smORFs are conserved across the entire metazoan phylogeny from invertebrates to vertebrates including man. These ultra-conserved functional smORF genes we call the Conserved smORF Catalog or CSC. These genes have been conserved across more than 500myr of evolution, and yet we know almost nothing at all about their functions. Due to a century of genetic analysis, the genome of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has the most complete functional annotation among metazoans. Functional annotations derived from Drosophila have been instrumental in hypothesis-based drug development for more than thirty years, and more recently have made possible the biological interpretation of hundreds of SNPs detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Hence, functional annotations derived in fly for conserved genes are transferable to human and are of direct clinical relevance. Remarkably, less than 10% of smORFs in Drosophila have been studied functionally, or experimentally verified as generating peptides. A combination of genome engineering, computational, molecular, and functional studies will be used to systematically and comprehensively characterize the CSC, representing the first genome-scale characterization of smORFs in any organism providing a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly studied class of proteins. In total, we will characterize and functionally annotate ~400 conserved smORFs using CRISPR knockout followed by phenotyping and rescue assays. We will assess the phenotypes of the mutants, measuring viability, morphology, fecundity and fertility, lifespan, metabolism (sugar and lipid levels), and a number of behavioral phenotypes. For smORFs with robust phenotypes, we will then attempt to rescue a subset of these mutants in three ways: first, by inserting the whole deleted RNA; second, with a version of the RNA with the smORF(s) removed by the addition a stop codon; and lastly, using a micro- construct containing only the smORF and the endogenous promoter. We will generate direct evidence for translation using tagged expression analysis and targeted MS/MS to scan for predicted polypeptides in the whole embryo and tissue dissection samples. In addition to validating the existence of the predicted molecules, this dataset will provide a foundational gold standard for further development of tools for the computational prediction of functional micropeptides. These studies are directed toward the understanding of basic life processes and lay the foundation for promoting better human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE As a public resource, our studies will combine genome-scale phenotyping with detailed functional characterization that will assess the effects of evolutionary conserved small open reading frames (smORFs) on animal viability, development, fecundity, metabolism, longevity and behavior. We will apply state-of-the art methods in Ribosomal profiling, CRISPR genome engineering and targeted mass spectrometry together with the development of new computational tools and analyses to generate a foundational gold standard dataset for the study of smORFs and the prediction of functional smORFs in genome annotation. Many of the genes encoding these molecules have been found to play important roles in human diseases such as neurodegeneration, developmental disorders and cancer.","Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs",9729028,R01HG009352,"['Adipose tissue', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Arthropods', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Collection', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Fertility', 'Foundations', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Ontology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminator Codon', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'adipokines', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'developmental disease', 'drug development', 'drug resource', 'embryo tissue', 'fly', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in situ imaging', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'man', 'mutant', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'polypeptide', 'promoter', 'ribosome profiling', 'sugar', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational genomics', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2019,1002519,0.012850308388456003

"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.

"A novel human T-cell platform to define biological effects of genome editing PROJECT SUMMARY Genome editing technologies have extraordinary potential as new genomic medicines that address underlying genetic causes of human disease; however, it remains challenging to predict their long-term safety, because we do not know the consequences of potential side effects of genome editing such as off-target mutations or immunogenicity. Our long-term goal is to understand and predict such unintended biological effects to advance the development of safe and effective therapies. T-cells are an ideal cellular model because: 1) they are highly relevant as the most widely used cells for development of therapeutic genome editing strategies (such as cell- based treatments for HIV and cancer) and 2) mature T-cells encode a diverse T-cell receptor repertoire that can be exploited as built-in cellular barcodes for quantifying clonal expansion or depletion in response to specific treatments. We, therefore, propose the following specific aims: 1) to predict which unintended editing sites have biological effects on human T-cells by integrating large-scale genome-wide activity and epigenomic profiles with state-of-the-art deep learning models and 2) to develop a human primary T-cell platform to detect functional effects of genome editing by measuring clonal representation, off-target mutation frequencies, immunogenicity, or gene expression. If successful, our experimental and predictive framework will profoundly increase confidence in the safety of the next generation of promising genome editing therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Genome editing technologies have extraordinary potential as the basis of new genomic medicines that address the underlying genetic causes of human disease; however, it is challenging to predict their long-term safety, because we do not know the consequences of potential unintended side effects of genome editing such as off- target mutations or immunogenicity. To define the biological effects of genome editing strategies, we will develop a human primary T-cell platform to sensitively detect functional effects coupled with an empirically-trained artificial intelligence models to predict them. Together, our platform will significantly improve confidence in safety assessments of promising genome editing therapeutics.",A novel human T-cell platform to define biological effects of genome editing,9678132,U01HL145793,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mature T-Lymphocyte', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenic', 'Organizational Change', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Library', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Retroviral Vector', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Standardization', 'Streptococcus pyogenes', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'adaptive immune response', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene therapy', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genotoxicity', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'response', 'safety testing', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic gene', 'therapeutic genome editing', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,ST.

"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease",9420632,U01HG009431,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome Mappings', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Repression', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'expression vector', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'personalized genomic medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'software development', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,620335,0.0807969233600326
"Inferring selection from human population genomic data Project Summary/Abstract Identifying genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation is a major challenge in population genetics. Particularly in humans, the task of confidently detecting the action of recent adaptive natural selection (or positive selection) has proved troublesome. Indeed there is considerable controversy over whether recent positive selection has a substantial impact on human genetic variation. The work proposed here will address this problem by creating a more complete map of positive selection across many human populations, identifying selection on de novo mutations as well as selection on previously standing variation.  Specifically, the proposed research seeks to construct a scan for positives election that is more robust and accurate than any currently existing methods (Aim 1). This tool will utilize supervised machine learning techniques allowing it combine information from a number of existing tests for natural selection, and will be tested extensively on a large suite of population genetic simulations presenting a wide range of potentially confounding scenarios. This tool will then be released to the public. Next, it will be applied to 26 human populations in which a large sample of genomes have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Aim 2), revealing similarities and differences in the tempo, mode, and targets of adaptive evolution across human populations. Finally, because selection on both beneficial and deleterious mutations skews genetic variation, our method will be used to identify regions of the genome least affected by natural selection, which will in turn be used to produce more accurate inferences of human demographic histories (Aim 3).  The mentored phase of this work will be performed within the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University. This is an intellectually stimulating environment with numerous journal clubs, an excellent seminar series, and several other research groups using computational techniques. The project will be performed under the stewardship of Dr. Andrew Kern, from whom the candidate will also receive training in machine learning and population genetics. Dr. Schrider will also receive training in population genetics and guidance from Dr. Jody Hey (Co-mentor) at nearby Temple University. This training will help Dr. Schrider acquire skills that will aid not only in the completion of the proposed work but also his transition to principle investigator of an internationally recognized independent research program studying the evolutionary forces driving patterns of human genetic variation. Project Narrative Detecting genes underpinning recent human adaptation remains a major challenge, and such genes are often associated with human disease. The work proposed here seeks to use supervised machine learning techniques to detect genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation across 26 different human populations. This work will also clarify human population size and migration histories, information that has implications for the prevalence of disease-causing mutations and efforts to identify them.",Inferring selection from human population genomic data,9617314,R00HG008696,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'International', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'disease-causing mutation', 'driving force', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human population genetics', 'learning strategy', 'population migration', 'pressure', 'programs', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R00,2018,249000,0.023841235366022607
"Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation Project Summary  It is now possible to readily identify sequence variants that have been subject to natural selection in human populations. Adaptive variants have been shown to underlie diversity in both disease risk and morphology across human populations, suggesting that the lens of evolution remains a powerful tool for understanding human biology, yet one that is currently underutilized. One challenge to realizing this potential is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, as are most signals of selection and variants associated with human phenotypic traits. Mutations modifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites in non- coding, cis-regulatory regions are hypothesized to be more amenable to driving phenotypic evolution than coding changes. These cis-regulatory regions are major determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and variation within enhancers has been indicated to play role in selection and disease. However, enhancer `regulatory grammar' – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with TFs to control gene expression, is poorly understood. The challenge of linking a regulatory variant under selection to an adaptive phenotype is similar to that facing disease association studies: the targeted gene, cell type, and biological process are often unknown, hindering further investigation.  Machine learning algorithms automate the discovery of patterns, making them well-suited to uncover sequence constraints and the combinatorial TF binding patterns of enhancers without relying on limited motif databases. I will optimize support vector machine classifiers to elucidate regulatory grammar from over 100 cell types and tissues. These models will be used to predict the impact of sequence variants on cis-regulatory sites, expanding the utility of the NHGRI's ENCODE and Roadmap projects. I will then apply these tissue- specific predictions to signals of selection and/or disease from the NHGRI's 1000 Genomes Project and its genome-wide association studies catalog. By describing the regulatory impact of signals of selection, I will globally describe patterns of functional adaptation across populations, identifying genes, and gene networks targeted by selection and/or disease. I will functionally characterize variants using massively parallel reporter assays and genome editing to give deeper insight into specific cases of evolution relevant for human health.    This project seeks to develop tools and resources to describe the structure and function of sequence variation in the human genome. This proposal seeks to vastly increase the number of elucidated cases of human evolution, and specifically characterize those adaptive variants associated with disease. We will share the functional regulatory predictions for the use in interpreting a broad range of genomic datasets. This work has broad implications, from interpreting genetic variants in populations and understanding functional targets of evolution, to prioritizing non-coding mutations for precision genomic medicine and beyond. Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to describe the tissue-specific effects of regulatory variants using machine learning algorithms, and then integrate these functional predictions with signals of selection and/or disease association in order to pinpoint genetic variants important for human evolution and health.",Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation,9406681,F32HG009226,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional adaptation', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'interest', 'lens', 'precision genomic medicine', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'trend', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,57066,0.021291808185621378
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells.

The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology.

"The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic variants that disrupt the functionality of regulatory sequences, and thereby alter gene expression levels, are major contributors to both evolutionary divergence between species and differences in risk for complex disease among humans. However, due to the complexity of the gene regulatory programs encoded in mammalian genomes and their rapid turnover between species, evaluating the function of non-protein-coding mutations is challenging. This is a major roadblock to tracing the evolution of human-specific biology. In addition, since the majority of disease-associated variants are non-coding, it impairs our ability to map the genetics of complex disease.  The long-term mission of my lab is to interpret the complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the human genome and accurately model the effects of genetic mutations to these elements on phenotypes relevant to disease and human evolution. We work toward these goals by integrating cutting-edge machine learning, statistical modeling of evolution, and the analysis of genotypes and phenotypes from large-scale clinical biobanks. In particular, my lab is uniquely well positioned to build on our previous work to address the following fundamental questions:  1. How have evolutionary transitions on the human-lineage modified the genome—in particular gene  regulatory programs—to produce human-specific biology? And how do these modifications relate to  human-specific disease risk?  2. What are the combinatorial rules underlying how TF binding patterns specify precise control of gene  regulation? And how do these gene regulatory “programs” evolve between species?  3. How do genetic and epigenetic mechanisms interact to specify the dynamic gene regulatory programs  that drive cellular development? And how are these programs perturbed in disease?  4. How can we interpret non-protein-coding mutations identified in patient genomes to inform treatment  and preventative care? Our work will produce much-needed methods for understanding the effects of mutations to gene regulatory regions and identify mutations responsible for differences in disease risk between human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The genetic mutations that distinguish humans from other great apes and that influence risk for complex disease are mostly found outside of genes. Many of these mutations influence when and where genes are expressed. However, we do not know how to interpret the effects of most such mutations on gene regulation, disease risk, or human evolution, we will develop computational models that leverage machine learning, evolutionary patterns, and large-scale clinical biobanks to identify mutations that disrupt proper control of genes and lead to disease.",The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease,9486376,R35GM127087,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'To specify', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cellular development', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'mammalian genome', 'programs', 'species difference']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2018,226333,0.04728511859339339
"Evolutionary Human Genomics: Demography, Natural Selection, and Transcriptional Regulation To be fully understood, the human genome must be considered in the context of evolution. The activities that have dominated human genomics for three decades — such as genome sequencing and annotation, interrogation with high-throughput biochemical assays, and the identification of associations between genetic variants and diseases — have been enormously informative, but these descriptive studies must eventually be understood within the theoretical framework of evolutionary genetics. We must continue to press forward from the what? to the why? and how? of human genetics.  The goal of my laboratory is to interpret high-throughput genomic data from an evolutionary perspective. Drawing from ideas and techniques in molecular evolution, population genetics, statistics, and computer science, we aim both to understand the evolutionary forces that have shaped human genomes, and to use evolution to shed light on the phenotypic importance of particular sequences. Our recent activities have focused in three major areas: (1)  reconstruction  of  features  of  human  evolution  based  on  genome  sequences;  (2)  prediction  of  the  fitness consequences  of  human  mutations;  and  (3)  the  study  of  transcriptional  regulation  and  its  evolution  in primates.   We have reported major findings in each of these areas, including the existence of gene flow from early modern humans to Eastern Neandertals, a map of fitness consequences for mutations across the human genome, and an analysis showing that the architecture of transcription initiation is highly similar at enhancers and promoters in the human genome.  Here we propose to extend our research substantially in each of these areas, working together with a broad range  of  experimental  and  theoretical  collaborators.    Our  new  goals  include  the  development  of  improved methods for reconstructing human demography, with a focus on ancient gene flow; extensions of our ancestral recombination graph (ARG) sampling methods to accommodate much larger samples sizes, with applications in association mapping and the detection of natural selection; two complementary machine-learning approaches for  improving  the  prediction  of  fitness  consequences  from  sequence  data;  an  experimental  collaboration  to leverage CRISPR-Cas9 screens in characterizing noncoding mutations; a multi-pronged study of the sequence determinants of RNA stability and their implications for the evolution of transcription units; and development of a new probabilistic model for turnover of regulatory elements.  Together, these projects will address a wide variety of fundamental questions about the function and evolution of sequences in the human genome. Vast quantities of genomic data are now available to describe patterns of genetic variation within  human populations and across species, and various measures of biochemical activity along the human  genome. These data need to be interpreted in light of the fundamental forces of mutation,  recombination, natural selection, and genetic drift that have shaped genetic variation. This  proposal describes a series of projects that make use of new computational, statistical, and  theoretical methods to address fundamental questions in human evolutionary genetics, including how  humans arose   from our archaic hominin and ape cousins, how human populations diverged from one  another, how new mutations influence human health and fitness, and how regulatory sequences  contribute to unique aspects of human biology.","Evolutionary Human Genomics: Demography, Natural Selection, and Transcriptional Regulation",9486266,R35GM127070,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Enhancers', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Primates', 'RNA Stability', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'computer science', 'fitness', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome annotation', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'promoter', 'reconstruction', 'statistics']",NIGMS,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R35,2018,479215,0.06382234753349283
"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9562959,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2018,1186500,0.03748735527252945
"Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing A major result from recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) is that the majority of genetic variants driving common human diseases lie in regulatory, rather than protein-coding, regions. Massive efforts to map epigenomic features such as localization of histone modifications (HMs) and transcription factors (TFs) have paved the way toward understanding the regulatory genome. However, dissecting the impact of an individual non-coding variant remains an unsolved challenge.  A variety of computational methods have been proposed, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies and machine learning techniques. However, these methods still do not provide conclusive information about causality of any specific non-coding mutation and lack gold-standard experimental results for evaluation. Several techniques are used to experimentally test the impact of individual regulatory variants. For example, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) synthesize thousands of oligonucleotides encoding mutated versions of putative regulatory elements placed in plasmids upstream of reporter genes. However, a major limitation is that tested sequences are outside of their endogenous chromosomal locus, and hence do not necessarily provide physiological relevance.  CRISPR enables targeted editing of genomic DNA. Indeed, CRISPR is widely used, but studies of individual point mutations have been primarily on a small scale and are usually limited to a handful of variants or to a single gene. The major throughput challenge in studying a specific variant using genome editing is in tying genotype to phenotype. Introducing individual mutations exhibits low efficiency, and thus there is a need for enrichment of the genotype or phenotype of interest prior to assessing the impact of a mutation on a phenotype, such as gene expression. Current enrichment methods either disrupt the physiological context or are low throughput. Recent efforts overcame these challenges using pooled editing to analyze thousands of mutations simultaneously, but were limited to variants in protein coding regions.  This proposal aims to develop a novel technique merging multiplexed genome editing of putative regulatory variants followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding variants on regulatory potential in their native genomic context. The key insight of the proposed approach is that mutations impacting epigenomic features can be measured both in genomic DNA and in phenotypic readouts such as ChIP-seq of TFs or HMs, avoiding the need for a selection step to connect genotypes with phenotypes. ​Aim 1 develops the pooled editing technique on a pilot set of previously validated regulatory variants. ​Aim 2 scales this approach to interrogate thousands of mutations at once. ​Aim 3 integrates experimental predictions with state of the art machine learning methods to evaluate and optimize computational methods for regulatory variant effect prediction. Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of genetic changes in the population contributing to common human diseases, such as schizophrenia, heart disease, and diabetes, lie in regions of the genome that do not code for proteins, but rather regulate the expression of genes. Despite massive efforts to map regulatory regions across dozens of human cell types, it is still difficult to predict the effect of an individual non-coding mutation. This project develops a high-throughput genome editing technique to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding mutations on regulatory potential in their native genomic context, with the ultimate goal of interpreting genetic changes leading to human disease.",Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing,9509167,R21HG010070,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Allelic Imbalance', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Fraction', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HNF4A gene', 'Heart Diseases', 'HepG2', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasmids', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2018,196302,0.04845487658451298
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes Project Summary/Abstract  The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions.

"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is to catalog all functional elements in the human genome through the integration and analysis of high-throughput data. We propose to continue the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, DAC) which will provide support and leadership in analyzing and integrating data from the ENCODE project as well as work closely with other ENCODE groups including the Data Coordination Center. Our proposed DAC team (Zhiping Weng, Mark Gerstein, Manolis Kellis, Roderic Guigo, Rafael Irizarry, X. Shirley Liu, Anshul Kundaje, and William Noble) has expertise across a wide range of fields including transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, evolution, genomics and proteomics, regulatory RNA, biophysics, and computational biology, where they are the leaders in machine learning, statistical genetics, networks, and gene annotation. These investigators also have a history of successfully working collaboratively in large consortia, particularly with other ENCODE groups. Their publication records demonstrate their synergistic approach to producing high-impact science and useful resources that benefit the broader biomedical communities. The proposed DAC will pursue the following four aims: Aim 1. Analyze and integrate data and metadata from a broad range of functional genomics projects; Aim 2. Serve as an informatics resource by supporting the activities of the ENCODE Analysis Working Group; Aim 3. Create high-quality Encyclopedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes; Aim 4. Assess quality and utility of the ENCODE data and provide feedback to NHGRI and the Consortium. RELEVANCE The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is a highly collaborative effort aiming to develop a comprehensive list of functional elements in the human genome. This proposal creates a data analysis center to provide support and computational prowess for this effort in collaboration with other ENCODE groups.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity.

"Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging Project Abstract Although genome instability has long been considered as one of the major causal factors of aging, little is known about the actual number of genome alterations per cell and their effects on aging organisms, most notably humans. In the research proposed here I will take a single cell approach to identify the most common types of somatic mutations, i.e., base substitutions, small INDELS, copy number variation, genome structural variation and retrotranspositions, in human B lymphocytes as a function of age. The overarching goal is then to estimate functional effects of these DNA mutations accumulated during human aging in this particular cell type, which will also serve as a model for studying somatic mutations and their consequences in other cell types. This could never be tested before, because it was never possible to analyze random somatic mutations in a tissue by sequencing bulk DNA from that tissue (mutations are low- abundant), I will achieve this goal by utilizing a new, single-cell, whole genome sequencing (SCWGS) protocol that we developed. In this project I will focus on human B lymphocytes from individuals varying in age from about 30 to over 100 years and determine the genome-wide frequency and location of the different types of mutations in multiple cells from each individual (Aim 1). Preliminary results already show a significant increase of both base substitution mutations and CNVs with age, with a substantial number of these mutations in B cell genomic regions that are potentially functional. Hence, in Aim 2 I will predict the actual functional effects of these potentially functional, age-related mutations using machine learning approaches and integrative network analysis. Finally, in Aim 3 I will empirically test these predictions as to whether the mutation loads observed affect B cell's ability of response to stimulus. Hence, to test the long-standing hypothesis of genome instability as a causal factor in aging ,I will determine age-related mutations in single cells at four levels: (1) number of mutations, mutation spectra and genome distribution in individual cells; (2) potential functional effects of individual mutations, i.e., non-synonymous mutations in exons and mutations in gene regulatory regions; (3) mutations collectively affecting the gene regulatory network; and (4) relationship between mutation load and B cell activation status. In summary, the results of the proposed project will, for the first time uncover possible direct functional effects of somatic mutations on cellular function. Project Narrative Genome instability is considered as one of the major factors of aging and age-related diseases. This research aims to study somatic DNA mutations in normal blood cells (B lymphocytes) of humans of different ages and evaluate the functional effect of these mutations. It will dramatically improve the knowledge of DNA mutations in aging and deepen the understanding of genome instability as a basic aging mechanism in human.",Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging,9527264,K99AG056656,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centenarian', 'Code', 'Collecting Cell', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication Damage', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA amplification', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Locus Control Region', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA amplification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrotransposition', 'Role', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Cell', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'crosslink', 'dietary restriction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'promoter', 'repair enzyme', 'repaired', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single cell technology', 'theories', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",K99,2018,40760,0.05510261964389401
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously.

"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9550852,R21HG009268,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'ds-DNA', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,266250,0.06248032959294967
"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer. RegulomeDB will enable researchers, clinicians, and sophisticated computer programs to relate DNA variants that lie in previously poorly understood regions of the human genome to possible functions thereby helping us understand the genetic basis of human variation and disease.",RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome,9420648,U41HG009293,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Research', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'cell determination', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'cloud based', 'computer program', 'gene function', 'genome annotation', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'outreach', 'social media', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'web-accessible', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U41,2018,733299,0.032693906751692835

"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",9425925,R01HG009906,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Imagery', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,383250,0.036587722767575756
"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off.

"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease.

"Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants Project Summary  We are now able to routinely sequence human genomes at single-base resolution. However, our ability to interpret the functional consequences of detected mutations has lagged behind. Computational approaches scale well but have poor accuracy, whereas retrospective analysis of detected variants has high accuracy but does not scale well. In order to solve this problem, a new experimental paradigm has emerged to empirically characterize the effects of mutations with high accuracy at scale. This approach takes advantage of recent and ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and has the potential to offer unprecedented insight into protein biochemistry and human disease. We believe these insights will prove to be critical for unlocking the potential of genomic medicine.  In this project we seek to comprehensively assess multiple molecular effects of PTEN mutations on protein function, and assess the utility of this data as a predictor for human clinical phenotype. The PTEN protein is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in the germline of some individuals with overgrowth disorders, cancer predisposition syndromes, or autism. Currently, it is impossible to predict the effects of the vast majority of PTEN germline mutations. Since the phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutation carriers is broad, it would be highly valuable to understand the ways in which phenotypic outcomes arise from PTEN mutation genotypes.  In Aim 1, we will first employ a yeast-based screen to assess the effects all PTEN single amino acid mutations on lipid phosphatase activity, the primary biochemical function of PTEN protein. It is known that several pathogenic variants are destabilized. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will perform a second, independent screen to assess the steady state protein stability of all PTEN single amino acid mutations. In Aim 3, we will use the data derived from this study as well as publically available biochemical information to train a classifier model to predict the relationship between the mutation genotypes and clinical phenotypes observed in humans. These data will increase our fundamental understanding of PTEN function and the role of mutations in diverse disorders, and could provide a valuable clinical tool that would increase the quality of life for PTEN mutation carriers. Project Narrative  Mutations in the gene PTEN are causal for a diverse set of clinical disorders ranging from cancer to autism spectrum disorder. Here, we seek to gain new fundamental insights into the functional relationships between PTEN mutations and clinical presentations by prospectively characterizing the effects of all single amino acid PTEN mutations in parallel. These data will allow the creation of new models that can predict risk of specific PTEN mutations for different clinical outcomes and potentially lead to personalized therapies, early interventions, and optimal outcomes for PTEN mutation carriers.",Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants,9539482,F31HD095571,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'PTEN protein', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitination', 'Variant', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'accurate diagnosis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genomic signature', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutation carrier', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein function', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'tumorigenic']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.0011412487263610823
"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome. Project Narrative Certain genetic diseases are thought to be caused by mutations in the DNA that alter the expression of nearby genes. This project will help us to understand how DNA sequence regulates the expression of genes, and aims to apply this knowledge to predict how and why mutations change gene expression and contribute to disease. By better understanding the fundamental causes of disease, we can better design therapeutic interventions.",Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease,9431485,K99HG009920,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enhancers', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Plasmids', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biochemical model', 'career', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'lupus-like', 'personalized medicine', 'promoter', 'rare variant', 'skills', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2018,120204,0.033533362630212636
"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9518337,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,537909,0.05661179793253587
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment. This research will also improve our understanding of which parts of the genome are essential to life and which parts of the genome might be responsible for the proliferation of cancer cells.",Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements,9416160,R00HG008171,"['Advisory Committees', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'CRISPR library', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Introns', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA library', 'Reagent', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'cancer cell', 'cancer drug resistance', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'deletion library', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome analysis', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'repaired', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small hairpin RNA', 'targeted nucleases', 'technology development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R00,2018,242325,0.04707910600456879
"Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs PROJECT SUMMARY Short peptides (10-100aa) are important regulators of physiology, development and metabolism, however their detection is difficult due to size and abundance. A stunning 30% of annotated human smORF genes include disease-associated variants mapped within exons, compared to 15% of human genes in general. Further, many smORFs are conserved across the entire metazoan phylogeny from invertebrates to vertebrates including man. These ultra-conserved functional smORF genes we call the Conserved smORF Catalog or CSC. These genes have been conserved across more than 500myr of evolution, and yet we know almost nothing at all about their functions. Due to a century of genetic analysis, the genome of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has the most complete functional annotation among metazoans. Functional annotations derived from Drosophila have been instrumental in hypothesis-based drug development for more than thirty years, and more recently have made possible the biological interpretation of hundreds of SNPs detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Hence, functional annotations derived in fly for conserved genes are transferable to human and are of direct clinical relevance. Remarkably, less than 10% of smORFs in Drosophila have been studied functionally, or experimentally verified as generating peptides. A combination of genome engineering, computational, molecular, and functional studies will be used to systematically and comprehensively characterize the CSC, representing the first genome-scale characterization of smORFs in any organism providing a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly studied class of proteins. In total, we will characterize and functionally annotate ~400 conserved smORFs using CRISPR knockout followed by phenotyping and rescue assays. We will assess the phenotypes of the mutants, measuring viability, morphology, fecundity and fertility, lifespan, metabolism (sugar and lipid levels), and a number of behavioral phenotypes. For smORFs with robust phenotypes, we will then attempt to rescue a subset of these mutants in three ways: first, by inserting the whole deleted RNA; second, with a version of the RNA with the smORF(s) removed by the addition a stop codon; and lastly, using a micro- construct containing only the smORF and the endogenous promoter. We will generate direct evidence for translation using tagged expression analysis and targeted MS/MS to scan for predicted polypeptides in the whole embryo and tissue dissection samples. In addition to validating the existence of the predicted molecules, this dataset will provide a foundational gold standard for further development of tools for the computational prediction of functional micropeptides. These studies are directed toward the understanding of basic life processes and lay the foundation for promoting better human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE As a public resource, our studies will combine genome-scale phenotyping with detailed functional characterization that will assess the effects of evolutionary conserved small open reading frames (smORFs) on animal viability, development, fecundity, metabolism, longevity and behavior. We will apply state-of-the art methods in Ribosomal profiling, CRISPR genome engineering and targeted mass spectrometry together with the development of new computational tools and analyses to generate a foundational gold standard dataset for the study of smORFs and the prediction of functional smORFs in genome annotation. Many of the genes encoding these molecules have been found to play important roles in human diseases such as neurodegeneration, developmental disorders and cancer.","Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs",9548692,R01HG009352,"['Adipose tissue', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Arthropods', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Collection', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Fertility', 'Foundations', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Ontology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminator Codon', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'adipokines', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'developmental disease', 'drug development', 'drug resource', 'embryo tissue', 'fly', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in situ imaging', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'man', 'mutant', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'polypeptide', 'promoter', 'ribosome profiling', 'sugar', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational genomics', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2018,1002519,0.012850308388456003
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9433692,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Investigating the clinical ontologies of loss-of-function and gain-of-function human gene variants No abstract available PROJECT NARRATIVE Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully described the roles of many human genes by analyzing large populations with shared traits, but these phenotype-based methodologies have incompletely described the clinical implications of numerous genes. I propose to address this knowledge gap by taking an unbiased, genotype-first approach to describing the relationships between dysfunctional genes and human disease traits through gene-burden phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), essentially intersecting data from our healthcare system-based biobank database comprised of genotype data, whole-exome sequencing, and electronic health records (EHR). In addition to capturing the disease implications of rare, loss-of-function mutations on a genome-wide scale, my proposed project has the potential to define the roles of known and novel gain-of-function mutations in human disease, offering a direction for follow-up functional studies as well as a platform for more efficient therapeutic discoveries.",Investigating the clinical ontologies of loss-of-function and gain-of-function human gene variants,9681800,F30HG010442,"['Address', 'African American', 'Animal Model', 'Authorization documentation', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Recontacts', 'Records', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'gain of function', 'gain of function mutation', 'gene discovery', 'gene product', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pre-doctoral', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational approach']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2018,49524,0.001615665544789378
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,9205487,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immunology procedure', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Ships', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,372603,0.01626109175150943
"Inferring selection from human population genomic data Project Summary/Abstract Identifying genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation is a major challenge in population genetics. Particularly in humans, the task of confidently detecting the action of recent adaptive natural selection (or positive selection) has proved troublesome. Indeed there is considerable controversy over whether recent positive selection has a substantial impact on human genetic variation. The work proposed here will address this problem by creating a more complete map of positive selection across many human populations, identifying selection on de novo mutations as well as selection on previously standing variation.  Specifically, the proposed research seeks to construct a scan for positives election that is more robust and accurate than any currently existing methods (Aim 1). This tool will utilize supervised machine learning techniques allowing it combine information from a number of existing tests for natural selection, and will be tested extensively on a large suite of population genetic simulations presenting a wide range of potentially confounding scenarios. This tool will then be released to the public. Next, it will be applied to 26 human populations in which a large sample of genomes have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Aim 2), revealing similarities and differences in the tempo, mode, and targets of adaptive evolution across human populations. Finally, because selection on both beneficial and deleterious mutations skews genetic variation, our method will be used to identify regions of the genome least affected by natural selection, which will in turn be used to produce more accurate inferences of human demographic histories (Aim 3).  The mentored phase of this work will be performed within the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University. This is an intellectually stimulating environment with numerous journal clubs, an excellent seminar series, and several other research groups using computational techniques. The project will be performed under the stewardship of Dr. Andrew Kern, from whom the candidate will also receive training in machine learning and population genetics. Dr. Schrider will also receive training in population genetics and guidance from Dr. Jody Hey (Co-mentor) at nearby Temple University. This training will help Dr. Schrider acquire skills that will aid not only in the completion of the proposed work but also his transition to principle investigator of an internationally recognized independent research program studying the evolutionary forces driving patterns of human genetic variation. Project Narrative Detecting genes underpinning recent human adaptation remains a major challenge, and such genes are often associated with human disease. The work proposed here seeks to use supervised machine learning techniques to detect genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation across 26 different human populations. This work will also clarify human population size and migration histories, information that has implications for the prevalence of disease-causing mutations and efforts to identify them.",Inferring selection from human population genomic data,9333402,K99HG008696,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'International', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'disease-causing mutation', 'driving force', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human population genetics', 'learning strategy', 'population migration', 'pressure', 'programs', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NHGRI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",K99,2017,37785,0.023841235366022607
"Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation Project Summary  It is now possible to readily identify sequence variants that have been subject to natural selection in human populations. Adaptive variants have been shown to underlie diversity in both disease risk and morphology across human populations, suggesting that the lens of evolution remains a powerful tool for understanding human biology, yet one that is currently underutilized. One challenge to realizing this potential is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, as are most signals of selection and variants associated with human phenotypic traits. Mutations modifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites in non- coding, cis-regulatory regions are hypothesized to be more amenable to driving phenotypic evolution than coding changes. These cis-regulatory regions are major determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and variation within enhancers has been indicated to play role in selection and disease. However, enhancer `regulatory grammar' – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with TFs to control gene expression, is poorly understood. The challenge of linking a regulatory variant under selection to an adaptive phenotype is similar to that facing disease association studies: the targeted gene, cell type, and biological process are often unknown, hindering further investigation.  Machine learning algorithms automate the discovery of patterns, making them well-suited to uncover sequence constraints and the combinatorial TF binding patterns of enhancers without relying on limited motif databases. I will optimize support vector machine classifiers to elucidate regulatory grammar from over 100 cell types and tissues. These models will be used to predict the impact of sequence variants on cis-regulatory sites, expanding the utility of the NHGRI's ENCODE and Roadmap projects. I will then apply these tissue- specific predictions to signals of selection and/or disease from the NHGRI's 1000 Genomes Project and its genome-wide association studies catalog. By describing the regulatory impact of signals of selection, I will globally describe patterns of functional adaptation across populations, identifying genes, and gene networks targeted by selection and/or disease. I will functionally characterize variants using massively parallel reporter assays and genome editing to give deeper insight into specific cases of evolution relevant for human health.    This project seeks to develop tools and resources to describe the structure and function of sequence variation in the human genome. This proposal seeks to vastly increase the number of elucidated cases of human evolution, and specifically characterize those adaptive variants associated with disease. We will share the functional regulatory predictions for the use in interpreting a broad range of genomic datasets. This work has broad implications, from interpreting genetic variants in populations and understanding functional targets of evolution, to prioritizing non-coding mutations for precision genomic medicine and beyond. Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to describe the tissue-specific effects of regulatory variants using machine learning algorithms, and then integrate these functional predictions with signals of selection and/or disease association in order to pinpoint genetic variants important for human evolution and health.",Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation,9502066,F32HG009226,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional adaptation', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'interest', 'lens', 'precision genomic medicine', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'trend', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,2400,0.021291808185621378
"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease",9247598,U01HG009431,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome Mappings', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Repression', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'expression vector', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'personalized genomic medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'software development', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,620335,0.0807969233600326
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9382313,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'learning network', 'men', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2017,471007,0.040553138853142524
"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9344966,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2017,1186500,0.03748735527252945
"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is to catalog all functional elements in the human genome through the integration and analysis of high-throughput data. We propose to continue the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, DAC) which will provide support and leadership in analyzing and integrating data from the ENCODE project as well as work closely with other ENCODE groups including the Data Coordination Center. Our proposed DAC team (Zhiping Weng, Mark Gerstein, Manolis Kellis, Roderic Guigo, Rafael Irizarry, X. Shirley Liu, Anshul Kundaje, and William Noble) has expertise across a wide range of fields including transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, evolution, genomics and proteomics, regulatory RNA, biophysics, and computational biology, where they are the leaders in machine learning, statistical genetics, networks, and gene annotation. These investigators also have a history of successfully working collaboratively in large consortia, particularly with other ENCODE groups. Their publication records demonstrate their synergistic approach to producing high-impact science and useful resources that benefit the broader biomedical communities. The proposed DAC will pursue the following four aims: Aim 1. Analyze and integrate data and metadata from a broad range of functional genomics projects; Aim 2. Serve as an informatics resource by supporting the activities of the ENCODE Analysis Working Group; Aim 3. Create high-quality Encyclopedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes; Aim 4. Assess quality and utility of the ENCODE data and provide feedback to NHGRI and the Consortium.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9247640,UM1HG009435,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'K-562', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2017,654000,0.08600164618479822
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,9203633,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Integration', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,309913,-0.004209565481013939
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs.

"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer.

"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes. In turn, this improved understanding will bring forth new potential targets to approach incorrect regulation leading to disease.",Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements,9478475,R00HG007356,"['Area', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Continuing Education', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'LIF gene', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transfection', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'member', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'online course', 'programs', 'promoter', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'undergraduate student', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R00,2017,50000,0.07390452089327196
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few.

"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming.

"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off. We will focus on neurons that are lost in disorders like Parkinson's disease, prioritizing the study o genes implicated in related disorders.

"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross and fine motor delay and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of `Ciliary localization' model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished work we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and genetic mapping on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 5] Developed methods to ultrastructurally interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion. The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining `discoverable' genes that when mutated lead to JSRD, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in any proven JSRD gene lead to collapse of the ciliary transition zone by correlating genetic mutations with ultrastructural ciliary defects. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations within a mechanistic framework, and a model that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment. This research will also improve our understanding of which parts of the genome are essential to life and which parts of the genome might be responsible for the proliferation of cancer cells.",Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements,9258454,R00HG008171,"['Advisory Committees', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'CRISPR library', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Introns', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA library', 'Reagent', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'deletion library', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome analysis', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'repaired', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small hairpin RNA', 'technology development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R00,2017,244439,0.04707910600456879
"Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs PROJECT SUMMARY Short peptides (10-100aa) are important regulators of physiology, development and metabolism, however their detection is difficult due to size and abundance. A stunning 30% of annotated human smORF genes include disease-associated variants mapped within exons, compared to 15% of human genes in general. Further, many smORFs are conserved across the entire metazoan phylogeny from invertebrates to vertebrates including man. These ultra-conserved functional smORF genes we call the Conserved smORF Catalog or CSC. These genes have been conserved across more than 500myr of evolution, and yet we know almost nothing at all about their functions. Due to a century of genetic analysis, the genome of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has the most complete functional annotation among metazoans. Functional annotations derived from Drosophila have been instrumental in hypothesis-based drug development for more than thirty years, and more recently have made possible the biological interpretation of hundreds of SNPs detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Hence, functional annotations derived in fly for conserved genes are transferable to human and are of direct clinical relevance. Remarkably, less than 10% of smORFs in Drosophila have been studied functionally, or experimentally verified as generating peptides. A combination of genome engineering, computational, molecular, and functional studies will be used to systematically and comprehensively characterize the CSC, representing the first genome-scale characterization of smORFs in any organism providing a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly studied class of proteins. In total, we will characterize and functionally annotate ~400 conserved smORFs using CRISPR knockout followed by phenotyping and rescue assays. We will assess the phenotypes of the mutants, measuring viability, morphology, fecundity and fertility, lifespan, metabolism (sugar and lipid levels), and a number of behavioral phenotypes. For smORFs with robust phenotypes, we will then attempt to rescue a subset of these mutants in three ways: first, by inserting the whole deleted RNA; second, with a version of the RNA with the smORF(s) removed by the addition a stop codon; and lastly, using a micro- construct containing only the smORF and the endogenous promoter. We will generate direct evidence for translation using tagged expression analysis and targeted MS/MS to scan for predicted polypeptides in the whole embryo and tissue dissection samples. In addition to validating the existence of the predicted molecules, this dataset will provide a foundational gold standard for further development of tools for the computational prediction of functional micropeptides. These studies are directed toward the understanding of basic life processes and lay the foundation for promoting better human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE As a public resource, our studies will combine genome-scale phenotyping with detailed functional characterization that will assess the effects of evolutionary conserved small open reading frames (smORFs) on animal viability, development, fecundity, metabolism, longevity and behavior. We will apply state-of-the art methods in Ribosomal profiling, CRISPR genome engineering and targeted mass spectrometry together with the development of new computational tools and analyses to generate a foundational gold standard dataset for the study of smORFs and the prediction of functional smORFs in genome annotation. Many of the genes encoding these molecules have been found to play important roles in human diseases such as neurodegeneration, developmental disorders and cancer.","Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs",9228843,R01HG009352,"['Adipose tissue', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Arthropods', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Collection', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Fertility', 'Foundations', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Ontology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminator Codon', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'adipokines', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'developmental disease', 'drug development', 'drug resource', 'embryo tissue', 'fly', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in situ imaging', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'man', 'mutant', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'polypeptide', 'promoter', 'ribosome profiling', 'sugar', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational genomics', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2017,1002725,0.012850308388456003
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9265137,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Deep learning frameworks for regulatory genomics. PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of genome sequencing and functional genomic data in multiple cellular contexts across healthy and diseased individuals provides a unique opportunity to decipher the regulatory and genetic architecture of diseases and traits. Novel computational methods are required that can address fundamental problems involving data representation, data integration, learning accurate predictive models from large-scale datasets and extraction of novel biological insights from complex models. We propose novel machine learning frameworks based on deep neural networks with new interpretation and hypothesis generation engines capable of integrating a wide variety of key genomic data types to learn predictive models of chromatin architecture and chromatin state; integrative models of transcription factor binding; determinants of macroscale three-dimensional genome architecture involving long-range chromatin contacts and the regulatory basis of functional non-coding, regulatory variants. Our methods are highly generalizable to several other related problems in regulatory genomics and lay the foundation for a paradigm shift in computational genomics.

"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.

"Inferring selection from human population genomic data Project Summary/Abstract Identifying genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation is a major challenge in population genetics. Particularly in humans, the task of confidently detecting the action of recent adaptive natural selection (or positive selection) has proved troublesome. Indeed there is considerable controversy over whether recent positive selection has a substantial impact on human genetic variation. The work proposed here will address this problem by creating a more complete map of positive selection across many human populations, identifying selection on de novo mutations as well as selection on previously standing variation.  Specifically, the proposed research seeks to construct a scan for positives election that is more robust and accurate than any currently existing methods (Aim 1). This tool will utilize supervised machine learning techniques allowing it combine information from a number of existing tests for natural selection, and will be tested extensively on a large suite of population genetic simulations presenting a wide range of potentially confounding scenarios. This tool will then be released to the public. Next, it will be applied to 26 human populations in which a large sample of genomes have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Aim 2), revealing similarities and differences in the tempo, mode, and targets of adaptive evolution across human populations. Finally, because selection on both beneficial and deleterious mutations skews genetic variation, our method will be used to identify regions of the genome least affected by natural selection, which will in turn be used to produce more accurate inferences of human demographic histories (Aim 3).  The mentored phase of this work will be performed within the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University. This is an intellectually stimulating environment with numerous journal clubs, an excellent seminar series, and several other research groups using computational techniques. The project will be performed under the stewardship of Dr. Andrew Kern, from whom the candidate will also receive training in machine learning and population genetics. Dr. Schrider will also receive training in population genetics and guidance from Dr. Jody Hey (Co-mentor) at nearby Temple University. This training will help Dr. Schrider acquire skills that will aid not only in the completion of the proposed work but also his transition to principle investigator of an internationally recognized independent research program studying the evolutionary forces driving patterns of human genetic variation. Project Narrative Detecting genes underpinning recent human adaptation remains a major challenge, and such genes are often associated with human disease. The work proposed here seeks to use supervised machine learning techniques to detect genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation across 26 different human populations. This work will also clarify human population size and migration histories, information that has implications for the prevalence of disease-causing mutations and efforts to identify them.",Inferring selection from human population genomic data,9180486,K99HG008696,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'disease-causing mutation', 'driving force', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human population genetics', 'learning strategy', 'population migration', 'pressure', 'programs', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NHGRI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",K99,2016,83411,0.023841235366022607
"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is to provide a complete inventory of all functional elements in the human genome using high-throughput experiments as well as computational methods. This proposal aims to create the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, or the DAC), consisting of a multi-disciplinary group of leading scientists who will respond to directions from the Analysis Working Group (AWG) of ENCODE and thus integrate data generated by all groups in the ENCODE Consortium in an unbiased manner. These analyses will substantially augment the value of the ENCODE data by integrating diverse data types. The DAC members are leaders in their respective fields of bioinformatics, computational machine learning, algorithm development, and statistical theory and application to genomic data (Zhiping Weng, Manolis Kellis, Mark Gerstein, Mark Daly, Roderic Guigo, Shirley Liu, Rafael Irizarry, and William Noble). They have a strong track record of delivering collaborative analysis in the context of the ENCODE and modENCODE Projects, in which this group of researchers was responsible for the much of the analyses and the majority of the figures and tables in the ENCODE and modENCODE papers.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8998963,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,306949,-0.004209565481013939
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs.

"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9206289,R21HG009268,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'ds-DNA', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,0.06248032959294967
"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions. The control over which doors are open in a cell regulates which instructions are accessible in a cell-type specific way.

"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes.

"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy. By providing functional annotation of natural and disease mutations in tyrosine kinases, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of mutated tyrosine kinases for drug discovery and personalized therapy.",Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases,9116916,R01GM114409,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Survival', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Drug Regulations', 'Drug resistance', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tyrosine', 'Tyrosine Kinase Domain', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computer framework', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2016,300000,0.02043575090098464
"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space.

"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler).

"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.            ",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9101722,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.                ",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,8859887,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'flu', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'research study', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,381704,0.01626109175150943
"Identification, Characterization, and Prediction of Cancer Driver Mutations in Regulatory Regions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research training program is to provide me (Dr. Collin Melton) with additional training in areas that will accelerate my career development as I transition from a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Michael Snyder's lab to an independent tenure track professor. The key elements of this plan are: Candidate: I have extensive training in experimental and computational approaches to studying biomedicine. Areas of additional focus for career development during the K99 mentored post-doctoral research phase include the acquisition of additional experimental skills and supplemental training in cancer biology, human genetics, human genomics, applied statistics, and parallel computing. Additionally, I will receive training in laboratory management, mentorship, and responsible conduct of research. This well-rounded plan will provide me with a skill set that will enable a facile transition from postdoctoral fellow to tenure track faculty. Environment: I have a valuable advisory committee with experts in the areas of genomics, genetics, and cancer biology to ensure my success in this training program and to guide me through the successful acquisition of a faculty job. These include my mentor Dr. Michael Snyder, my co-mentor Dr. James Ford and two advisors, Dr. Hanlee Ji and Dr. Anshul Kundaje. The environment at Stanford University in the Snyder lab and department of Genetics fosters productivity and collaboration with word class facilities, resources, and researchers. Research: My proposed research plan in cancer genomics is timely, relevant, and innovative. The majority of current research in cancer genomics has made groundbreaking progress in understanding the relevant DNA variation that occurs in coding regions of the genome; however, 97-98% of the human genome does not code for protein. This proposal focuses specifically on studying the regulatory regions of the human genome to identify, characterize, and interpret the impact of point mutations in these regulatory regions. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that point mutations in regulatory regions of the human genome drive cancer formation and the functional consequences of these mutations can be predicted using machine learning algorithms. Aim 1 proposes the statistical identification of regulatory regions which are mutated across cancer samples, Aim 2 proposes functional characterization of the prevalent mutations identified in Aim 1, and Aim 3 extends the analysis of characterizing the effects of mutations genome-wide through use of genomics approaches and proposes the use of machine learning to classify novel mutations as either disrupting, activating, or having no effect on regulatory element activity. Through its use of experimental datasets combined with predictive models for functional consequences of individual cancer variation, this research will further the goal of personalized genome interpretation for cancer therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every cancer patient's disease is caused by unique set of abnormal variation in the human genome. Advancing our understanding this variation aids in the development of new treatments and the proper application of existing treatments. This proposal focuses on understanding a particular type of cancer variation that occurs in regulatory regions of the human genome.","Identification, Characterization, and Prediction of Cancer Driver Mutations in Regulatory Regions",8931936,K99CA191093,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hela Cells', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Occupations', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'career development', 'epigenomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'interest', 'migration', 'mutant', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'trend', 'tumor progression']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2015,116122,0.04099944152673425
"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is to provide a complete inventory of all functional elements in the human genome using high-throughput experiments as well as computational methods. This proposal aims to create the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, or the DAC), consisting of a multi-disciplinary group of leading scientists who will respond to directions from the Analysis Working Group (AWG) of ENCODE and thus integrate data generated by all groups in the ENCODE Consortium in an unbiased manner. These analyses will substantially augment the value of the ENCODE data by integrating diverse data types. The DAC members are leaders in their respective fields of bioinformatics, computational machine learning, algorithm development, and statistical theory and application to genomic data (Zhiping Weng, Manolis Kellis, Mark Gerstein, Mark Daly, Roderic Guigo, Shirley Liu, Rafael Irizarry, and William Noble). They have a strong track record of delivering collaborative analysis in the context of the ENCODE and modENCODE Projects, in which this group of researchers was responsible for the much of the analyses and the majority of the figures and tables in the ENCODE and modENCODE papers. The proposed DAC will pursue goals summarized as the following seven aims: Aim 1.

"CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop novel computational methods to identify regulatory elements in repetitive regions of the genomes using publicly available data from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE. Half of the human genome is derived from transposable elements (TEs). These highly repetitive elements were recently shown to harbor transcription factor (TF) binding sites and epigenetic regulatory signals. TEs have shaped gene regulatory networks during evolution and are dysregulated in many diseases. However, the extent to which TEs contribute to regulatory networks, and how TE sequences evolved from parasitic DNA to functional elements, remains unclear. In this proposal, we introduce a computational framework to identify TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers and to estimate the evolutionary impact of TEs to cell type-specific gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to develop an epigenomics-based approach to detect TE-derived enhancers and their target genes. Extending our recent success in developing machine learning methods to integrate DNA methylation data, we will bring to bear computational models that allow us to predict TE-derived enhancers. If successful, not only will we produce the largest catalog of TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers, but also have created a robust framework for detecting the contributions of TEs to gene regulation in any cell type or tissue. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop a TE epigenetic association assay. By taking advantage of the multi-copy nature of TE sequences, we will identify TE sequence variations or features that associate with specific epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will reconstruct sequences of the evolutionary intermediates of candidate TEs and estimate their epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will address questions including whether particular classes of TEs gained TF-binding sites and then spread quickly, or whether TEs first spread and later gained TF binding sites. If successful, we will develop an understanding of what sequence features drive the functional potential of TEs, and the modes of evolution followed by different TEs during regulatory network evolution. Such an understanding will dramatically improve our picture of regulatory network evolution by including the effects of TEs, a major class of fast evolving regulatory sequences that have been largely ignored in functional genomics studies. In Specific Aim 3 we will create a public resource based on our newly invented Repeat Element Browser to allow investigators to display, analyze, compare, and integrate Roadmap/ENCODE data and their own data on TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of data produced by consortia such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and TCGA, which currently discard most TE derived sequences. Such improvement will in turn accelerate research into understanding the impact of TEs on normal gene regulation and in human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transposable elements (TEs) are a special class of DNA sequences which copy themselves and ""hop"" to many different locations in the genome. TEs are often referred to as ""junk"" DNA or ""parasitic"" DNA, but they are more and more implicated in genome evolution, gene regulation and diseases. These elements comprise a huge fraction of the DNA in mammalian genomes, including 50% of the human genome. Because of their repetitive nature they are generally discarded in most genomics studies. We recently showed that these elements often carry regulatory sequences that are co-opted by host genomes to perform normal gene regulation. Here we propose to study the extent to which TEs contribute to normal gene regulation throughout the genome and how mis-regulation of TE derived sequences contributes to disease.",CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS,8928618,R01ES024992,"['Address', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Junk DNA', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mammalian genome', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,152500,0.04048641789337526
"Human-Specific Gain and Loss of Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will seek to utilize population genetic data to distinguish regions of the human genome experiencing purifying selection from unconstrained genomic regions. Because genomic sequences subject to selective constraint perform functions beneficial to the organism, this work will reveal previously unknown functional regions of the human genome. In particular, since this approach does not rely on comparisons between humans and closely related species, it can uncover regions acquiring or losing selective constraint after humans split from other great apes. Regions acquiring function during this time period would represent an important class of recent human adaptations, and could reveal molecular changes responsible for uniquely human phenotypes. Beyond its evolutionary importance, this work would improve the functional annotation of the human genome, revealing functional regions that could result in harmful effects if disrupted, and that cannot be detected from comparative genomic techniques. In addition to revealing human-specific gains-of- function, the proposed project would allow for detection of losses-of-function occurring since the human- chimpanzee divergence. These events could also underlie important phenotypic changes in recent human evolution, as several known human-specific losses-of-function were adaptive. Even fitness-neutral losses of function are informative, as they may reveal differences in selective pressures allowing certain functions to be lost in humans but requiring them to be maintained in our relatives. Finally, the work proposed here will combine population genetic and phylogenetic data to reveal constrained regions with better accuracy than can be achieved by examining either of these types of data alone. This will result in further improvements to the functional annotation of the human genome, especially with respect to non-protein-coding functional regions that cannot be reliably detected by ab initio techniques.  Performing this research will improve the applicant's knowledge of population genetics and computational methods that can leverage polymorphism to draw inferences about the selective and functional importance of different genomic loci. Instruction from a sponsor and co-sponsor with expertise in both of these areas, as well as interaction with other faculty members and postdocs at the sponsor's institution, will be invaluable for improving the applicant's skills. This experience wil greatly enhance the applicant's chances of achieving his goal of succeeding as an independent scientist running a lab at a research university. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to its evolutionary significance, the proposed research will reveal previously unknown regions of the human genome that perform beneficial functions. Because disruptions of these regions would have harmful effects, these findings will allow for more complete analyses of the genetic basis of disease in humans.",Human-Specific Gain and Loss of Function,8796200,F32GM105231,"['Address', 'Area', 'Beryllium', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Explosion', 'Faculty', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Pan Genus', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'driving force', 'experience', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'gain of function', 'genetic analysis', 'human population genetics', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'pressure', 'skills']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F32,2015,54194,0.04466267214118035
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8795204,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,304719,-0.004209565481013939
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs.

"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes.

"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions. The control over which doors are open in a cell regulates which instructions are accessible in a cell-type specific way.

"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy.

"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space.

"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment. This research will also improve our understanding of which parts of the genome are essential to life and which parts of the genome might be responsible for the proliferation of cancer cells.                ",Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements,8804084,K99HG008171,"['Advisory Committees', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Beryllium', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Indium', 'Institutes', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Introns', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reagent', 'Relative (related person)', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'deletion library', 'design', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'repaired', 'research study', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small hairpin RNA', 'technology development', 'tool']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2015,99937,0.04707910600456879
"Identification, Characterization, and Prediction of Cancer Driver Mutations in Regulatory Regions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research training program is to provide me (Dr. Collin Melton) with additional training in areas that will accelerate my career development as I transition from a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Michael Snyder's lab to an independent tenure track professor. The key elements of this plan are: Candidate: I have extensive training in experimental and computational approaches to studying biomedicine. Areas of additional focus for career development during the K99 mentored post-doctoral research phase include the acquisition of additional experimental skills and supplemental training in cancer biology, human genetics, human genomics, applied statistics, and parallel computing. Additionally, I will receive training in laboratory management, mentorship, and responsible conduct of research. This well-rounded plan will provide me with a skill set that will enable a facile transition from postdoctoral fellow to tenure track faculty. Environment: I have a valuable advisory committee with experts in the areas of genomics, genetics, and cancer biology to ensure my success in this training program and to guide me through the successful acquisition of a faculty job. These include my mentor Dr. Michael Snyder, my co-mentor Dr. James Ford and two advisors, Dr. Hanlee Ji and Dr. Anshul Kundaje. The environment at Stanford University in the Snyder lab and department of Genetics fosters productivity and collaboration with word class facilities, resources, and researchers. Research: My proposed research plan in cancer genomics is timely, relevant, and innovative. The majority of current research in cancer genomics has made groundbreaking progress in understanding the relevant DNA variation that occurs in coding regions of the genome; however, 97-98% of the human genome does not code for protein. This proposal focuses specifically on studying the regulatory regions of the human genome to identify, characterize, and interpret the impact of point mutations in these regulatory regions. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that point mutations in regulatory regions of the human genome drive cancer formation and the functional consequences of these mutations can be predicted using machine learning algorithms. Aim 1 proposes the statistical identification of regulatory regions which are mutated across cancer samples, Aim 2 proposes functional characterization of the prevalent mutations identified in Aim 1, and Aim 3 extends the analysis of characterizing the effects of mutations genome-wide through use of genomics approaches and proposes the use of machine learning to classify novel mutations as either disrupting, activating, or having no effect on regulatory element activity. Through its use of experimental datasets combined with predictive models for functional consequences of individual cancer variation, this research will further the goal of personalized genome interpretation for cancer therapy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every cancer patient's disease is caused by unique set of abnormal variation in the human genome. Advancing our understanding this variation aids in the development of new treatments and the proper application of existing treatments. This proposal focuses on understanding a particular type of cancer variation that occurs in regulatory regions of the human genome.        The written critiques of individual reviewers are provided in essentially unedited form in this section.

"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is to provide a complete inventory of all functional elements in the human genome using high-throughput experiments as well as computational methods. This proposal aims to create the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, or the DAC), consisting of a multi-disciplinary group of leading scientists who will respond to directions from the Analysis Working Group (AWG) of ENCODE and thus integrate data generated by all groups in the ENCODE Consortium in an unbiased manner. These analyses will substantially augment the value of the ENCODE data by integrating diverse data types. The DAC members are leaders in their respective fields of bioinformatics, computational machine learning, algorithm development, and statistical theory and application to genomic data (Zhiping Weng, Manolis Kellis, Mark Gerstein, Mark Daly, Roderic Guigo, Shirley Liu, Rafael Irizarry, and William Noble). They have a strong track record of delivering collaborative analysis in the context of the ENCODE and modENCODE Projects, in which this group of researchers was responsible for the much of the analyses and the majority of the figures and tables in the ENCODE and modENCODE papers. The proposed DAC will pursue goals summarized as the following seven aims: Aim 1. To work with the AWG to define and prioritize integrative analyses of ENCODE data; Aim 2.To provide shared computational guidelines and infrastructure for data processing, common analysis tasks, and data exchange; Aim 3. To facilitate and carry out data integration for element-specific analyses; Aim 4.To facilitate and carry out exploratory data analyses across elements; Aim 5.To facilitate and carry out comparative analyses across human, mouse, fly, and worm; Aim 6.To facilitate integration with the genome-wide association studies community and disease datasets; and Aim 7.To facilitate writing Consortium papers and assist evaluating ENCODE data.

"CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop novel computational methods to identify regulatory elements in repetitive regions of the genomes using publicly available data from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE. Half of the human genome is derived from transposable elements (TEs). These highly repetitive elements were recently shown to harbor transcription factor (TF) binding sites and epigenetic regulatory signals. TEs have shaped gene regulatory networks during evolution and are dysregulated in many diseases. However, the extent to which TEs contribute to regulatory networks, and how TE sequences evolved from parasitic DNA to functional elements, remains unclear. In this proposal, we introduce a computational framework to identify TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers and to estimate the evolutionary impact of TEs to cell type-specific gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to develop an epigenomics-based approach to detect TE-derived enhancers and their target genes. Extending our recent success in developing machine learning methods to integrate DNA methylation data, we will bring to bear computational models that allow us to predict TE-derived enhancers. If successful, not only will we produce the largest catalog of TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers, but also have created a robust framework for detecting the contributions of TEs to gene regulation in any cell type or tissue. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop a TE epigenetic association assay. By taking advantage of the multi-copy nature of TE sequences, we will identify TE sequence variations or features that associate with specific epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will reconstruct sequences of the evolutionary intermediates of candidate TEs and estimate their epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will address questions including whether particular classes of TEs gained TF-binding sites and then spread quickly, or whether TEs first spread and later gained TF binding sites. If successful, we will develop an understanding of what sequence features drive the functional potential of TEs, and the modes of evolution followed by different TEs during regulatory network evolution. Such an understanding will dramatically improve our picture of regulatory network evolution by including the effects of TEs, a major class of fast evolving regulatory sequences that have been largely ignored in functional genomics studies. In Specific Aim 3 we will create a public resource based on our newly invented Repeat Element Browser to allow investigators to display, analyze, compare, and integrate Roadmap/ENCODE data and their own data on TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of data produced by consortia such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and TCGA, which currently discard most TE derived sequences. Such improvement will in turn accelerate research into understanding the impact of TEs on normal gene regulation and in human diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transposable elements (TEs) are a special class of DNA sequences which copy themselves and ""hop"" to many different locations in the genome. TEs are often referred to as ""junk"" DNA or ""parasitic"" DNA, but they are more and more implicated in genome evolution, gene regulation and diseases. These elements comprise a huge fraction of the DNA in mammalian genomes, including 50% of the human genome. Because of their repetitive nature they are generally discarded in most genomics studies. We recently showed that these elements often carry regulatory sequences that are co-opted by host genomes to perform normal gene regulation. Here we propose to study the extent to which TEs contribute to normal gene regulation throughout the genome and how mis-regulation of TE derived sequences contributes to disease.            ",CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS,8815597,R01ES024992,"['Address', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Junk DNA', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mammalian genome', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,189100,0.04048641789337526
"Human-Specific Gain and Loss of Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will seek to utilize population genetic data to distinguish regions of the human genome experiencing purifying selection from unconstrained genomic regions. Because genomic sequences subject to selective constraint perform functions beneficial to the organism, this work will reveal previously unknown functional regions of the human genome. In particular, since this approach does not rely on comparisons between humans and closely related species, it can uncover regions acquiring or losing selective constraint after humans split from other great apes. Regions acquiring function during this time period would represent an important class of recent human adaptations, and could reveal molecular changes responsible for uniquely human phenotypes. Beyond its evolutionary importance, this work would improve the functional annotation of the human genome, revealing functional regions that could result in harmful effects if disrupted, and that cannot be detected from comparative genomic techniques. In addition to revealing human-specific gains-of- function, the proposed project would allow for detection of losses-of-function occurring since the human- chimpanzee divergence. These events could also underlie important phenotypic changes in recent human evolution, as several known human-specific losses-of-function were adaptive. Even fitness-neutral losses of function are informative, as they may reveal differences in selective pressures allowing certain functions to be lost in humans but requiring them to be maintained in our relatives. Finally, the work proposed here will combine population genetic and phylogenetic data to reveal constrained regions with better accuracy than can be achieved by examining either of these types of data alone. This will result in further improvements to the functional annotation of the human genome, especially with respect to non-protein-coding functional regions that cannot be reliably detected by ab initio techniques.  Performing this research will improve the applicant's knowledge of population genetics and computational methods that can leverage polymorphism to draw inferences about the selective and functional importance of different genomic loci. Instruction from a sponsor and co-sponsor with expertise in both of these areas, as well as interaction with other faculty members and postdocs at the sponsor's institution, will be invaluable for improving the applicant's skills. This experience wil greatly enhance the applicant's chances of achieving his goal of succeeding as an independent scientist running a lab at a research university.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to its evolutionary significance, the proposed research will reveal previously unknown regions of the human genome that perform beneficial functions. Because disruptions of these regions would have harmful effects, these findings will allow for more complete analyses of the genetic basis of disease in humans.            ",Human-Specific Gain and Loss of Function,8635216,F32GM105231,"['Address', 'Area', 'Beryllium', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Explosion', 'Faculty', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Pan Genus', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'driving force', 'experience', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'gain of function', 'genetic analysis', 'human population genetics', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'skills']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F32,2014,51530,0.04466267214118035
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs. Our models will serve as a resource to provide comprehensive context-specific regulatory annotations for disease-associated gene sets and co-expression modules.            ",Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation,8815902,R01ES025009,"['Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Indium', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Play', 'Process', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,318763,0.0312683485096895
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape  Title: Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape PI: Rohs, Remo (USC); Co-I: Noble, William Stafford (UW); Co-I: Tullius, Thomas D. (BU) PROJECT SUMMARY Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.            ",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8632246,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2014,334303,-0.004960394546115545
"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes. In turn, this improved understanding will bring forth new potential targets to approach incorrect regulation leading to disease.",Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements,8898931,R00HG007356,"['Accounting', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Continuing Education', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transfection', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'promoter', 'research study', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R00,2014,248822,0.07390452089327196
"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off. We will focus on neurons that are lost in disorders like Parkinson's disease, prioritizing the study o genes implicated in related disorders. Our work will provide new insight into the identity, composition and biological requirement for these gene switches, informing our understanding of mutations that contribute to common genetic disorders.                                ",Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon,8811553,R01NS062972,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Megacolon', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Dopamine', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Functional RNA', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Instruction', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Midbrain structure', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Nucleotides', 'Ontology', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prosencephalon', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Switch Genes', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'addiction', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'encryption', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hindbrain', 'human disease', 'insight', 'mutant', 'neuropsychiatry', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,467946,0.06754198838203795

"Human-Specific Gain and Loss of Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will seek to utilize population genetic data to distinguish regions of the human genome experiencing purifying selection from unconstrained genomic regions. Because genomic sequences subject to selective constraint perform functions beneficial to the organism, this work will reveal previously unknown functional regions of the human genome. In particular, since this approach does not rely on comparisons between humans and closely related species, it can uncover regions acquiring or losing selective constraint after humans split from other great apes. Regions acquiring function during this time period would represent an important class of recent human adaptations, and could reveal molecular changes responsible for uniquely human phenotypes. Beyond its evolutionary importance, this work would improve the functional annotation of the human genome, revealing functional regions that could result in harmful effects if disrupted, and that cannot be detected from comparative genomic techniques. In addition to revealing human-specific gains-of- function, the proposed project would allow for detection of losses-of-function occurring since the human- chimpanzee divergence. These events could also underlie important phenotypic changes in recent human evolution, as several known human-specific losses-of-function were adaptive. Even fitness-neutral losses of function are informative, as they may reveal differences in selective pressures allowing certain functions to be lost in humans but requiring them to be maintained in our relatives. Finally, the work proposed here will combine population genetic and phylogenetic data to reveal constrained regions with better accuracy than can be achieved by examining either of these types of data alone. This will result in further improvements to the functional annotation of the human genome, especially with respect to non-protein-coding functional regions that cannot be reliably detected by ab initio techniques.  Performing this research will improve the applicant's knowledge of population genetics and computational methods that can leverage polymorphism to draw inferences about the selective and functional importance of different genomic loci. Instruction from a sponsor and co-sponsor with expertise in both of these areas, as well as interaction with other faculty members and postdocs at the sponsor's institution, will be invaluable for improving the applicant's skills. This experience wil greatly enhance the applicant's chances of achieving his goal of succeeding as an independent scientist running a lab at a research university.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to its evolutionary significance, the proposed research will reveal previously unknown regions of the human genome that perform beneficial functions.

"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition. Project Narrative  The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy). Moreover, the systems biology approach and the tools that will be developed in this project can be applied to any species for which genome data is available, which will enable researchers to model and manipulate a broad spectrum of regulatory circuits in biology with potential medical and pharmaceutical applications.",Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome,8309335,F32GM095273,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Arabidopsis', 'Assimilations', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fertilizers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Glutamine', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrogen', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-DNA', 'TF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Water Pollution', 'base', 'genome-wide', 'ground water', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'network models', 'nutrition', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2012,53942,0.03428945233312155

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.

"What Made Us Human?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative genomics promises to shed light on those genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. Mounting evidence suggests that the vast majority of functional differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes are in regions that do not code for proteins. Focusing on these non-coding regions, we will investigate lineage-specific evolution in the human genome. Our approach includes developing likelihood ratio tests for identifying changes in either the rate or the pattern of nucleotide substitution in a single lineage. These novel methods will be implemented in open source software that can be used to scan an entire genome. We will apply this evolutionary analysis to multiple sequence alignments of human and other vertebrates, including several closely related species (macaque, chimpanzee, Neanderthal), allowing us to identify recent changes in the human genome. In order to concentrate on functionally relevant changes, evolutionary testing will be limited to sets of candidate regions with specific known or predicted functions (e.g. regulatory regions, RNA genes). Predicted functional regions will be identified using machine learning classification techniques. These classifiers will employ measures of sequence conservation as well as the rapidly expanding collection of experimental and bioinformatic annotations of the human genome, including results of the ENCODE Project and other functional genomic studies. After identifying those regions that were most significantly altered in the human lineage, we will use this functional information to develop testable hypotheses about the effects of the observed changes. Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species. Identification and characterization of the genetic changes leading to modern humans is of fundamental interest. These investigations also promise to contribute to our understanding of the causal mechanisms behind human diseases, leading to directed treatment and prevention strategies.          n/a",What Made Us Human?,8134360,R01GM082901,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Evolution', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Relative (related person)', 'Ribonucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'simulation', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,J.

"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy). Moreover, the systems biology approach and the tools that will be developed in this project can be applied to any species for which genome data is available, which will enable researchers to model and manipulate a broad spectrum of regulatory circuits in biology with potential medical and pharmaceutical applications.          Project Narrative  The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and  predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases. The proposed research will lead to the development of a novel computational tool to discover enhancer elements using genome-wide chromatin signatures. Successful completion of the project will also uncover novel enhancers in two biomedically important cell types, embryonic stem cell and T lymphocyte, which could generate new insights into the regulatory networks controlling stem cell phenotype and T cell development and activation.              Narrative: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"A Comprehensive catalog of human DNasel hypersensitive sites The overall aim of this proposal is to establish a comprehensive, high-quality catalogue of human DNasel hypersensitive sites (DHSs) spanning all major tissue lineages.

"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.

This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human.",A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets,8327885,RC2HG005639,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boundary Elements', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Functional RNA', 'Galaxy', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Indium', 'Knowledge', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Polymerase', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Element', 'Replication Initiation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'epigenomics', 'file format', 'fly', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'markov model', 'member', 'next generation', 'novel', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sequence learning', 'task analysis', 'transcription factor', 'working group']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,RC2,2011,1296550,0.049205355030280916
"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome."" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes. Individual susceptibility to disease is determined in part by genetics, and we can map with high precision the locations of DNA variants associated with disease susceptibility. In order to understand how these variants contribute to disease susceptibility, we need to identify the biological functions of all DNA sequences; the proposed work will help us map these functional DNA sequences.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome. The data generated in this project will be the first systematic functional analysis of TF binding sites at base-pair resolution.              n/a",Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters,8132645,U01HG004561,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transfection', 'base', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'forest', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'research study', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2010,430000,0.03430231358425587
"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy).

"What Made Us Human?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative genomics promises to shed light on those genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. Mounting evidence suggests that the vast majority of functional differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes are in regions that do not code for proteins. Focusing on these non-coding regions, we will investigate lineage-specific evolution in the human genome. Our approach includes developing likelihood ratio tests for identifying changes in either the rate or the pattern of nucleotide substitution in a single lineage. These novel methods will be implemented in open source software that can be used to scan an entire genome. We will apply this evolutionary analysis to multiple sequence alignments of human and other vertebrates, including several closely related species (macaque, chimpanzee, Neanderthal), allowing us to identify recent changes in the human genome. In order to concentrate on functionally relevant changes, evolutionary testing will be limited to sets of candidate regions with specific known or predicted functions (e.g. regulatory regions, RNA genes). Predicted functional regions will be identified using machine learning classification techniques. These classifiers will employ measures of sequence conservation as well as the rapidly expanding collection of experimental and bioinformatic annotations of the human genome, including results of the ENCODE Project and other functional genomic studies. After identifying those regions that were most significantly altered in the human lineage, we will use this functional information to develop testable hypotheses about the effects of the observed changes. Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species. Identification and characterization of the genetic changes leading to modern humans is of fundamental interest. These investigations also promise to contribute to our understanding of the causal mechanisms behind human diseases, leading to directed treatment and prevention strategies.          n/a",What Made Us Human?,7902231,R01GM082901,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Evolution', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Relative (related person)', 'Ribonucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'simulation', 'trait']",NIGMS,J.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

Successful completion of the project will also uncover novel enhancers in two biomedically important cell types, embryonic stem cell and T lymphocyte, which could generate new insights into the regulatory networks controlling stem cell phenotype and T cell development and activation.              Narrative: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting.

"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances.

"Nuclear Receptor Networks in Human Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex disorders typically involve multiple factors and gene loci and are heavily influenced by environmental conditions. This is particularly true for metabolic diseases and diseases affecting mental health. As is often the case with such illnesses, regulators of gene expression, as well as their specific target genes can play a major role in not just the etiology but also the treatment of the disease. Some of the best characterized regulators associated with human disease are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily -- transcription factors that are regulated by the binding of ligands that are often influenced by environmental conditions. However, while a great deal is known about the mechanism by which individual nuclear receptors regulate the expression of individual target genes, what is sorely lacking is a comprehensive view of all their potential target genes in all the tissues in which they are expressed. This is true not only for metabolic organs for which the role of nuclear receptors is fairly well studied, but also the CNS where much less is known about the target genes and the functions of the nuclear receptors. Furthermore, several nuclear receptors are very effective drug targets, for both metabolic and mental disorders, making them among the most clinically relevant of all the transcription factors. Whereas recent advances in whole genome expression profiling and genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq) have allowed us to begin to define the complete transcriptome for some of these factors, much more remains to be done. Furthermore, these approaches can be technically challenging and costly, and hence very limiting. A complementary approach that has not been fully exploited is a computational one based on the DNA response elements that recruit the nuclear receptors to the regulatory regions of their target genes. However, in order to take full advantage of this approach, one must first have a comprehensive dataset of the binding motifs to which the receptors bind. The goals of this proposal are two-fold: 1) to comprehensively define the DNA binding specificity of a critical group of nuclear receptors using high throughput technology; and 2) to use that data to mine existing datasets in order to associate those nuclear receptors with human disease. These goals will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Use protein binding microarrays (PBMs) to determine the DNA binding specificity of select nuclear receptors on 10's of 1000's of unique sequences; and then use that data to develop high accuracy computational models to predict the entire set of sequences to which a given nuclear receptor binds; 2) use the PBM data and models generated in Aim 1 to computationally identify all the potential binding sites, target genes and related SNPs in the human genome for each nuclear receptor; and cross reference the results with databases linking genes and SNPs to human diseases (i.e., GAD and HapMap); 3) incorporate the results into a network of nuclear receptors and their target genes, with particular emphasis on metabolic diseases and mental health disorders.

"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome."" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes. Individual susceptibility to disease is determined in part by genetics, and we can map with high precision the locations of DNA variants associated with disease susceptibility. In order to understand how these variants contribute to disease susceptibility, we need to identify the biological functions of all DNA sequences; the proposed work will help us map these functional DNA sequences.           Project Narrative for ""Enhance human ENCODE by functional comparisons to mouse"" Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome. The data generated in this project will be the first systematic functional analysis of TF binding sites at base-pair resolution.              n/a",Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters,7684267,U01HG004561,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transfection', 'base', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'forest', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'research study', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2009,430878,0.03430231358425587
"What Made Us Human?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative genomics promises to shed light on those genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. Mounting evidence suggests that the vast majority of functional differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes are in regions that do not code for proteins. Focusing on these non-coding regions, we will investigate lineage-specific evolution in the human genome. Our approach includes developing likelihood ratio tests for identifying changes in either the rate or the pattern of nucleotide substitution in a single lineage. These novel methods will be implemented in open source software that can be used to scan an entire genome. We will apply this evolutionary analysis to multiple sequence alignments of human and other vertebrates, including several closely related species (macaque, chimpanzee, Neanderthal), allowing us to identify recent changes in the human genome. In order to concentrate on functionally relevant changes, evolutionary testing will be limited to sets of candidate regions with specific known or predicted functions (e.g. regulatory regions, RNA genes). Predicted functional regions will be identified using machine learning classification techniques. These classifiers will employ measures of sequence conservation as well as the rapidly expanding collection of experimental and bioinformatic annotations of the human genome, including results of the ENCODE Project and other functional genomic studies. After identifying those regions that were most significantly altered in the human lineage, we will use this functional information to develop testable hypotheses about the effects of the observed changes. Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species. Identification and characterization of the genetic changes leading to modern humans is of fundamental interest. These investigations also promise to contribute to our understanding of the causal mechanisms behind human diseases, leading to directed treatment and prevention strategies.          n/a",What Made Us Human?,7681225,R01GM082901,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Evolution', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Relative (related person)', 'Ribonucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'comparative', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'simulation', 'trait']",NIGMS,J.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting. Fertility selection as well as sex- specific viabilities will be studied in order to clarify the role of multiple paternities, which has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting. Genomic data from mammalian species will be analyzed using tools from statistical learning in order to predict which genes are likely to be imprinted.

"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances.

"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome."" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes. Individual susceptibility to disease is determined in part by genetics, and we can map with high precision the locations of DNA variants associated with disease susceptibility. In order to understand how these variants contribute to disease susceptibility, we need to identify the biological functions of all DNA sequences; the proposed work will help us map these functional DNA sequences.           Project Narrative for ""Enhance human ENCODE by functional comparisons to mouse"" Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome.

"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer. Understanding how a factor targets genes is crucial for discovering the pathways whose malfunction leads to the symptoms.

"What Made Us Human?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative genomics promises to shed light on those genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. Mounting evidence suggests that the vast majority of functional differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes are in regions that do not code for proteins. Focusing on these non-coding regions, we will investigate lineage-specific evolution in the human genome. Our approach includes developing likelihood ratio tests for identifying changes in either the rate or the pattern of nucleotide substitution in a single lineage. These novel methods will be implemented in open source software that can be used to scan an entire genome. We will apply this evolutionary analysis to multiple sequence alignments of human and other vertebrates, including several closely related species (macaque, chimpanzee, Neanderthal), allowing us to identify recent changes in the human genome. In order to concentrate on functionally relevant changes, evolutionary testing will be limited to sets of candidate regions with specific known or predicted functions (e.g. regulatory regions, RNA genes). Predicted functional regions will be identified using machine learning classification techniques. These classifiers will employ measures of sequence conservation as well as the rapidly expanding collection of experimental and bioinformatic annotations of the human genome, including results of the ENCODE Project and other functional genomic studies. After identifying those regions that were most significantly altered in the human lineage, we will use this functional information to develop testable hypotheses about the effects of the observed changes. Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species. Identification and characterization of the genetic changes leading to modern humans is of fundamental interest. These investigations also promise to contribute to our understanding of the causal mechanisms behind human diseases, leading to directed treatment and prevention strategies.          n/a",What Made Us Human?,7522602,R01GM082901,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Evolution', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pan Genus', 'Pan troglodytes', 'Pattern', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Ribonucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'comparative', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'simulation', 'trait']",NIGMS,J.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting. Fertility selection as well as sex- specific viabilities will be studied in order to clarify the role of multiple paternities, which has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting. Genomic data from mammalian species will be analyzed using tools from statistical learning in order to predict which genes are likely to be imprinted.

Correlations between DMA sequence properties and predicted imprinting status based on life history characteristics will also be sought.           n/a",Population Genetics Theory,7313297,R01GM028016,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriophages', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Formulations', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fertility', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Genomics', 'Haploidy', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Organism', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Population Genetics', 'Production', 'Property', 'Purpose', 'Rate', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistically Significant', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'driving force', 'father role', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'imprint', 'influenza epidemic', 'life history', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,258957,0.026567800036254804
"A Comprehensive catalog of human DNasel hypersensitive sites    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The overall aim of this proposal is to establish a comprehensive, high-quality catalogue of human DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) spanning all major tissue lineages. We plan to map DNaseI hypersensitive sites at physiological resolution across the genome with high sensitivity and specificity. The major focus of our production effort will be on data quality, a strategy that served the Human Genome Project well. Accordingly, samples will be rigorously screened in a pipeline fashion, with only a select set advancing to whole-genome data collection (Specific Aim 1). To ensure the broadest possible coverage of both unique and non-unique genomic territories, a synergistic combination of three technologies (DNase-array, digital mapping of DNAasel cleave site sequences, and Quantitative Chromatin Profiling) will be applied (Specific Aim 2). This combination will enable mapping of >95% of the DHSs in the genome of each cell type. Independent validation provides the ultimate quality standard. We therefore plan to validate the DHS catalogue in a statistically rigorous fashion using hypersensitivity Southerns, a well-established, gold standard assay (Specific Aim 3). Since DNAasel hypersensitive sites are generic markers of a broad spectrum of human cis-regulatory sequences, the utility of the catalogue will be greatly enhanced by the classification of DHSs into major functional categories including promoters, distal elements (enhancers, LCRs), and insulators (Specific Aim 4). Validation of DHS functional classes will be accomplished using well-tested cell and transgenic assays of biological function (Specific Aim 5).           n/a",A Comprehensive catalog of human DNasel hypersensitive sites,7410206,U54HG004592,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Boundary Elements', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Detection', 'Digestion', 'Distal', 'Distal Enhancer Elements', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Enhancers', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Locales', 'Locus Control Region', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Public Domains', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput screening', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'promoter']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U54,2007,3114596,0.04624134118972918
"Computational discovery of cis-regulatory sequences DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall aim of this research proposal is to combine computational and functional methodologies to develop a set of algorithms with high positive predictive value for identifying and classifying candidate cis-regulatory sequences sites in the vicinity of any gene of interest. The underlying hypothesis is that functional non-coding sequences - particularly those governing a set of tissue-specific genes - will evince common features at the sequence level that can be identified computationally and modeled with sufficient precision to enable accurate de novo predictions. However, it is expected that the overall predictive value of computational approaches alone will be comparatively low. Rather, employed as a screening tool in combination with a high throughput functional validation methodology, computational approaches of even low (10-20%) predictive potential would be of enormous value, enabling rapid culling of tens of thousands of cis-regulatory sequences from the human genome.  The strategy employed will commence with development of a catalogue of functional non-coding sequences for a set of tissue- and lineage-specific human genes. This will be achieved by precise localization of DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) surrounding 100 erythroid-specific and 100 lymphoid lineage -restricted genes. Both tissues represent highly developed experimental systems, and a substantial amount of information has already come to light concerning both cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms operative within these cell types. DNaseI hypersensitivity in vivo is the sine qua non of a diverse cast of transcriptional regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, and locus control regions. The utility of the nuclease hypersensitivity assay for identification of in vivo-functional regulatory sequences is unmatched: it is a mature, functionally-based approach validated by a vast literature and decades of highly productive studies encompassing hundreds of human and other eukaryotic genes. A comprehensive catalogue of HSs surrounding any gene would therefore be expected to encompass the majority - if not all - of its cognate transcriptional control elements active in the tissues under study.  Next, a significant data mining effort will be undertaken. This phase will involve (i) structural comparisons among identified functional elements; (ii) identification of candidate transcription factor binding sites within HS sequences using motif analysis methodologies; (iii) identification of correlations with ancillary genomic features such as transcriptional start sites, CpG islands, and certain classes of repetitive sequences; and (iv) structural comparisons between in vivo functional sequences and evolutionarily conserved sequences within the study regions. A major focus will be application of model techniques such as hidden Markov models, technology from gene prediction programs, and classifier kernel methods such as support vector machines. Based on these analyses, initial models for prospective detection of cis-regulatory regions will be developed.  Finally, these models will be tested in and out of sample for sensitivity and specificity. Positive feedback from successfully confirmed sites will be utilized to refine the information collected above, thereby enhancing the basic model. Predictive techniques will then be applied systematically to discover cis-regulatory sequences surrounding erythroid, lymphoid, and diverse other classes of human genes.  The resulting database will be of incalculable value in furthering the study of the regulation of human genes and the computational methodologies employed therein. n/a",Computational discovery of cis-regulatory sequences,7281307,R01GM071923,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chromatin', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conserved Sequence', 'CpG Islands', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Erythroid', 'Feedback', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Localized', 'Locus Control Region', 'Lymphoid', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'data mining', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'markov model', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2007,578070,0.04529562049899201
"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer. Understanding how a factor targets genes is crucial for discovering the pathways whose malfunction leads to the symptoms. This is an achievable goal, given the right way to analyze the plethora of genome-wide data available to us.           n/a",Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes,7096896,R01HG003470,"['DNA', 'binding sites', 'bioinformatics', 'gene expression', 'genes', 'genome', 'neoplasm /cancer', 'proteins', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,RUTGERS THE ST UNIV OF NJ NEW BRUNSWICK,R01,2006,302050,0.03200943234691944
"Shifting Conceptions of Human Identity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  . One of the most important questions raised by the ongoing achievements of the Human Genome Project is how this new biological knowledge - and the powers it confers - will affect our identity and self-understanding as human beings. This book project focuses on one key aspect of this complex issue: exploring the extent to which human identity can be reconciled with deliberate design or partial redesign. The author proposes to shed new light on this question by comparing the debates surrounding two areas of scientific innovation that are not normally associated with each other, but that are in fact deeply related: the enterprise of human genetic intervention and the enterprise of building intelligent machines. Both these enterprises entail ""pushing the limits"" of traditional concepts of what it means to be human; and both ultimately confront their makers with the same core ""family"" of questions: What are the defining features of human personhood? To what extent can those features be modified or extended, before human personhood begins to break down? Can some (or all) of those features find embodiment in an entity other than a human being? These kinds of questions are no longer the sole province of science fiction writers, but have been taken up with increasing seriousness by mainstream scientists and technologists, as well as by a wide array of ""science watchers"" in academia, legislative circles, and the news media.   . Through documentary research and interviews, this project aims to deepen our understanding of the history and sociology of the debates surrounding these powerful new technologies, electro-mechanical and biological, that are perceived as destabilizing human identity. The intended audience for the book is a broad one: scientists and technological practitioners interested in the social and cultural reception of their research; legislators and other policymakers with a stake in the governance of science; general educated readers who are concerned about the role of science and technology in shaping our collective future. n/a",Shifting Conceptions of Human Identity,6915830,R03HG003298,"['adult human (21+)', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biotechnology', 'books', 'clinical research', 'ethics', 'genetic manipulation', 'history of life science', 'human subject', 'identity', 'interview', 'robotics', 'self concept', 'sociology /anthropology']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R03,2005,75833,0.02345818470516935
"Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development PROJECT SUMMARY A major unanswered question is how chromatin topology coordinates human development and cellular differentiation, and how genome folding is differentially regulated in human disease. It is thought that three- dimensional (3D) chromatin organization is driven by transcriptional regulators, but fundamental mechanisms of this regulation as it relates to disease-relevant human cells have not been well explored. We propose to elucidate the temporally dynamic 3D nucleome (4DN) that underlies human cardiac differentiation, its molecular underpinnings, and the impact of mutations that underly defective 4DN organization in human congenital heart disease (CHD). CHDs are the most common birth defect and arise from abnormal heart development. The genetic basis of CHD is largely mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers (e.g. WDR5, KMT2D) and transcription factors (TFs, e.g. TBX5, GATA4), many of which also cause adult-onset arrhythmias. The impact of CHD mutations on the 4DN has not been explored. We hypothesize that 3D genome folding is highly regulated during cardiac differentiation and is impacted by disease-causing mutations in transcriptional regulators and non-coding elements. We will use iPS cell models and machine learning to elucidate dynamic 3D chromatin organization in human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells during normal and diseased cardiac differentiation. We propose 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Establish a kilobase-scale 4D map of genome folding in human cardiomyocytes (CM) and endothelial cell (EC) differentiation. We will use directed differentiation of human iPS cells towards the two major cell types of the developing heart: CMs and ECs, and using microC across a fine time course of differentiation we will define at kilobase scale the 3D organization of the genome, capturing the states of developmental intermediates and the final differentiated cells. This aim will generate an essential integrated 4DN template for discovery in cardiac differentiation. In Aim 2: we will Determine the regulatory and disease-related basis for cardiac 3D chromatin organization. We will perform microC in iPS cell lines with CHD-associated mutations in transcriptional regulators, differentiated into CMs and ECs. These findings will establish the degree to which CHD is caused by abnormal genome folding and chromatin states, with important relevance to other human cardiovascular diseases. Finally, Aim 3 will address High-throughput screening of millions of CHD and synthetic non- coding mutations with a deep-learning model of dynamic genome folding. We will build a deep-learning model predicting 3D chromatin contact frequencies across cardiac differentiation at kilobase-resolution. By introducing thousands of CHD patient deletions and other non-coding mutations in silico, we will prioritize variants likely to interact with transcriptional regulators to cause disease through disrupted genome folding. Several candidates will be validated in engineered iPS cells differentiated into CMs and ECs. These results will provide a novel platform for computational discovery of disease variant impact across diverse human diseases PROJECT NARRATIVE Congenital heart defects are present in 1-2 out of 100 births, and are caused by mutations in genes that may control the 3-dimensional organization of chromosomes. We will use human cellular models and Artificial Intelligence to understand how chromosome organization is controlled during heart development and altered by disease processes. This will reveal fundamental concepts of gene regulation and may lead to a better understanding congenital heart defects towards improving diagnosis and treatment.",Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development,10118056,U01HL157989,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'CCCTC-binding factor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'GATA4 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Diseases', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Development', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'SMARCA2 gene', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cardiogenesis', 'cell type', 'cohesin', 'computational platform', 'congenital heart disorder', 'deep learning', 'disease-causing mutation', 'high throughput screening', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell model', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,J.

"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease",9851890,U01HG009431,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome Mappings', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Repression', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'expression vector', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large scale data', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'machine learning method', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'personalized genomic medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'software development', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,620335,0.0807969233600326
"A novel human T-cell platform to define biological effects of genome editing PROJECT SUMMARY Genome editing technologies have extraordinary potential as new genomic medicines that address underlying genetic causes of human disease; however, it remains challenging to predict their long-term safety, because we do not know the consequences of potential side effects of genome editing such as off-target mutations or immunogenicity. Our long-term goal is to understand and predict such unintended biological effects to advance the development of safe and effective therapies. T-cells are an ideal cellular model because: 1) they are highly relevant as the most widely used cells for development of therapeutic genome editing strategies (such as cell-based treatments for HIV and cancer) and 2) mature T-cells encode a diverse T-cell receptor repertoire that can be exploited as built-in cellular barcodes for quantifying clonal expansion or depletion in response to specific treatments. We, therefore, propose the following specific aims: 1) to predict which unintended editing sites have biological effects on human T-cells by integrating large-scale genome-wide activity and epigenomic profiles with state-of-the-art deep learning models and 2) to develop a human primary T-cell platform to detect functional effects of genome editing by measuring clonal representation, off-target mutation frequencies, immunogenicity, or gene expression. If successful, our experimental and predictive framework will profoundly increase confidence in the safety of the next generation of promising genome editing therapies.

"A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT  The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders has been increasing for decades, leaving millions of afflicted individuals. Despite the high heritability, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Most risk loci are located in noncoding genomic elements without direct effects on protein products. Comprehensive functional annotation and variant impact quantification are essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how genetic variants contribute to psychiatric diseases. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-seq) with population-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the genetic regulatory grammar in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to prioritize genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we will (1) dissect the cis- regulatory landscape of the PFC using population-scale epigenetics data, (2) construct multi- model gene regulatory networks by linking distal cis-regulatory elements to genes using chromatin co-variability analyses, (3) integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data to identify key transcription factors and variants that contribute to psychiatric disorders. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on one genome, this proposed work presents a truly novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles from hundreds of individuals. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements will expand the number of known functional regions in the human brain by at least an order. We will release our methods and resources in the form of web services, distributed open-source software, and annotation databases, which will also benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition to its scientific content, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in computational genomics and neurogenetics. This training will take place at Yale University (in the Dept. of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry) under the mentorship of Prof. Mark Gerstein (functional genomics), Prof. Nenad Sestan (neurogenetics), and Prof. Hongyu Zhao (statistical genetics and machine learning). A committee of experienced psychiatric disease experts and data scientists will also provide advice on both scientific research and career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover cis- regulatory elements in the noncoding genome by incorporating novel functional characterization technologies (such as STARR-seq) with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data from psychiatric patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely on a single genome, this work assumes a dynamic regulatory program in each individual and explores the regulatory heterogeneity across hundreds of epigenomes, thereby significantly expanding our current knowledge of the noncoding genome and facilitating functional interpretation of genetic variants. Furthermore, it will also generate publicly available annotation resources and software packages for the scientific community, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of novel therapeutic target discovery for treating psychiatric disorders.",A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders,10039384,K01MH123896,"['Affect', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Entropy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'genomic profiles', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenetics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'open source', 'programs', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K01,2020,94262,0.0030756723977967693
"Inferring selection from human population genomic data Project Summary/Abstract Identifying genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation is a major challenge in population genetics. Particularly in humans, the task of confidently detecting the action of recent adaptive natural selection (or positive selection) has proved troublesome. Indeed there is considerable controversy over whether recent positive selection has a substantial impact on human genetic variation. The work proposed here will address this problem by creating a more complete map of positive selection across many human populations, identifying selection on de novo mutations as well as selection on previously standing variation.  Specifically, the proposed research seeks to construct a scan for positives election that is more robust and accurate than any currently existing methods (Aim 1). This tool will utilize supervised machine learning techniques allowing it combine information from a number of existing tests for natural selection, and will be tested extensively on a large suite of population genetic simulations presenting a wide range of potentially confounding scenarios. This tool will then be released to the public. Next, it will be applied to 26 human populations in which a large sample of genomes have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Aim 2), revealing similarities and differences in the tempo, mode, and targets of adaptive evolution across human populations. Finally, because selection on both beneficial and deleterious mutations skews genetic variation, our method will be used to identify regions of the genome least affected by natural selection, which will in turn be used to produce more accurate inferences of human demographic histories (Aim 3).  The mentored phase of this work will be performed within the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University. This is an intellectually stimulating environment with numerous journal clubs, an excellent seminar series, and several other research groups using computational techniques. The project will be performed under the stewardship of Dr. Andrew Kern, from whom the candidate will also receive training in machine learning and population genetics. Dr. Schrider will also receive training in population genetics and guidance from Dr. Jody Hey (Co-mentor) at nearby Temple University. This training will help Dr. Schrider acquire skills that will aid not only in the completion of the proposed work but also his transition to principle investigator of an internationally recognized independent research program studying the evolutionary forces driving patterns of human genetic variation. Project Narrative Detecting genes underpinning recent human adaptation remains a major challenge, and such genes are often associated with human disease. The work proposed here seeks to use supervised machine learning techniques to detect genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation across 26 different human populations. This work will also clarify human population size and migration histories, information that has implications for the prevalence of disease-causing mutations and efforts to identify them.",Inferring selection from human population genomic data,9868315,R00HG008696,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'International', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'de novo mutation', 'disease-causing mutation', 'driving force', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human population genetics', 'machine learning method', 'population migration', 'pressure', 'programs', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R00,2020,237600,0.023841235366022607
"Predictive models of boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs) Predictive Models of Boundaries of Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) in Human. The PI proposes a high-impact research project to develop novel predictive models to predict boundaries of topologically associated domains in a variety of human cell lines. The goal of this proposal is not just building these models, but to interpret them to decipher some biological meaning. Studies have recently indicated that genomes of different organisms are organized into domains called topologically associated domains (TADs), which consist of self-interacting chromatin regions. The boundaries of TADs have been linked to several diseases and gene regulation by modulating the overall genome organization. Accurate identification of these boundaries and interpretation of regulatory units in the boundaries are essential for development of effective therapy for diseases in future. Since existing experimental methods are costly and challenging, we will explore, evaluate, and compare predictive models for accurate prediction of TAD boundaries in different cell lines. We propose to test if sequence and chromatin features can be used in traditional feature based predictive models for TADs boundaries. This will be compared to deep learning models which have the capacity to “learn” important discriminative features from sequence information only. By interpreting these models, we will characterize the regulatory code of TAD boundaries by (a) characterizing a comprehensive list of motifs in TAD boundaries in 10 different human cell lines, (b) characterizing the association between different chromatin features and their predicting power of the boundaries, and (c) scoring, ranking and prioritizing likely causal noncoding variants that occur in TAD boundaries. Furthermore, this proposal will enhance the infrastructure of research and education at University of Houston-Downtown, introducing computational biology research experiences to underrepresented minority, first time in college and female undergraduate students, who would otherwise lack such opportunities. This will allow them to acquire a broad area of skills in data analytics, critical thinking, and research methods, which will encourage them to pursue a biomedical career and change their lives and communities. Understanding genome organization is essential for deciphering the complex mechanisms associated with gene regulation and development of effective therapies for diseases. To address current experimental challenges to quantify genome organization, we propose to develop novel artificial intelligence predictive methods to decipher genome organization in humans. These methods will also help link how genome organization modulates gene expression and how it can contribute to diseases.",Predictive models of boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs),9965292,R15GM137254,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Consumption', 'Critical Thinking', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Education', 'Enhancers', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'college', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'long short term memory', 'mammalian genome', 'model building', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON-DOWNTOWN,R15,2020,399888,0.010289164707896268
"Identification of Transposable Element Insertions in the Kids First Data Project Summary Insertion of transposable elements (TEs, sometimes referred to as “jumping genes”) into the human genome can be pathogenic. Our aim in this project is to use sophisticated computational approaches to characterize TE insertions in the whole-genome sequencing data generated in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program and identify any insertional mutations that may disrupt gene function. The large scale of the Kids First program provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the role of TE insertions in childhood cancers and structural birth defects, as well as to create a resource of reference TE maps that will be important for all other TE studies. We will first modify our existing algorithm called xTEA for the trio design of the Kids First studies and increase the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. Then, we will apply it to the thousands of trios that have been profiled in the Kids First program, using a pipeline optimized for the cloud environment. The resulting set of TE insertions (especially L1, Alu, SVA, and HERV insertions) will be curated with all relevant features and be made into a database for the community. We will also apply machine learning methods to improve the calls once a sufficient amount of training data have been obtained. To investigate the potential pathogenicity of the mutation, we will first focus on insertions within genes, but we will also explore those in regulatory elements inferred from epigenetic profiling data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transposable elements, or “jumping genes”, are genetic elements that can alter the DNA of an individual. We aim to utilize a computational method to identify such elements in the genome sequencing data generated in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program.

"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",9840492,R01HG009906,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,395000,0.036587722767575756
"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation. Recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques has allowed us to look beyond the nucleotide sequence of DNA and investigate the principles of higher-order chromatin organization.

"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,9932470,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,517318,0.02015226837195027
"Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, thousands of experiments from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have successfully proﬁled regulatory elements and epigenetic landscape along the genome. More recently, over 2,000 chromatin organization datasets have been generated from 4D Nucleome (4DN) Project, and they provide complementary information about how these genomic and epigenomic elements are spatially organized in a nucleus. Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization with previously proﬁled 1D epigenome in different cell types will be a key step to understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation over long genomic distances. However, there are two challenges. First, there is a resolution mismatch between chromatin organization data (e.g. Hi-C contacts) which are usually measured at 10k base pair resolution, and epigenome-based chromatin state features (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) whose signals are usually at tens to hundreds of base pairs. Second, existing computational approaches for analyzing epigenome, such as annotating genome and understanding regulatory elements, all treat the DNA sequence as one-dimensional data, leaving the important 3D structural information unutilized. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches for understanding the relationship between chromatin state features and chromatin organization, performing 3D and 4D genome annotation, and identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors, respectively. After the completion of the proposed work, we expect to have: (1) an accurate and interpretable computational model to predict chromatin contact maps at nucleosome resolution for a wide range of cell lines, (2) 3D and 4D genome annotations over dynamic chromatin organization, regulatory elements and epigenomic features, and (3) a computational method for identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors which can help us understand the orchestration of noncoding genetic variants. These results will provide fundamental understanding of disease-relevant genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to jointly analyze 3D chromatin organization data and 1D epigenomic features, and reveal the interplay among regulatory elements, epigenomic features, and dynamic chromatin organization. These new methods will help us understand the mechanisms of the genetic variants identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies, and understand the genetic basis of many human diseases.",Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome,10046394,R35HG011279,"['3-Dimensional', 'Base Pairing', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Genome Project', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleosomes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'novel', 'three dimensional structure', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2020,432839,0.04747413664294909
"The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic variants that disrupt the functionality of regulatory sequences, and thereby alter gene expression levels, are major contributors to both evolutionary divergence between species and differences in risk for complex disease among humans. However, due to the complexity of the gene regulatory programs encoded in mammalian genomes and their rapid turnover between species, evaluating the function of non-protein-coding mutations is challenging. This is a major roadblock to tracing the evolution of human-specific biology. In addition, since the majority of disease-associated variants are non-coding, it impairs our ability to map the genetics of complex disease.  The long-term mission of my lab is to interpret the complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the human genome and accurately model the effects of genetic mutations to these elements on phenotypes relevant to disease and human evolution. We work toward these goals by integrating cutting-edge machine learning, statistical modeling of evolution, and the analysis of genotypes and phenotypes from large-scale clinical biobanks. In particular, my lab is uniquely well positioned to build on our previous work to address the following fundamental questions:  1. How have evolutionary transitions on the human-lineage modified the genome—in particular gene  regulatory programs—to produce human-specific biology? And how do these modifications relate to  human-specific disease risk?  2. What are the combinatorial rules underlying how TF binding patterns specify precise control of gene  regulation? And how do these gene regulatory “programs” evolve between species?  3. How do genetic and epigenetic mechanisms interact to specify the dynamic gene regulatory programs  that drive cellular development? And how are these programs perturbed in disease?  4. How can we interpret non-protein-coding mutations identified in patient genomes to inform treatment  and preventative care? Our work will produce much-needed methods for understanding the effects of mutations to gene regulatory regions and identify mutations responsible for differences in disease risk between human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The genetic mutations that distinguish humans from other great apes and that influence risk for complex disease are mostly found outside of genes. Many of these mutations influence when and where genes are expressed. However, we do not know how to interpret the effects of most such mutations on gene regulation, disease risk, or human evolution, we will develop computational models that leverage machine learning, evolutionary patterns, and large-scale clinical biobanks to identify mutations that disrupt proper control of genes and lead to disease.",The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease,9904747,R35GM127087,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'To specify', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cellular development', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'mammalian genome', 'programs', 'species difference']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,86356,0.04728511859339339
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9984421,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'diverse data', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'informatics tool', 'learning network', 'men', 'next generation sequence data', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2020,464920,0.040553138853142524
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes Project Summary/Abstract  The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. One of the main bottlenecks in analysis of genomic data is efficient and scalable visualization approaches. The PEGR open source platform will provide programmatic access to any number of human cell sequenced datasets, from any stage of NGS processing, with the pipeline analysis results available for high-throughput machine learning testing and development. This project will empower discovery through the automated analysis and visualization of results from both small- and large-scale datasets. This architecture will include the following features: 1) a secure, cloud-based, metadata management system that instills best practices of experimental rigor, reproducibility, and data sharing; 2) automated Galaxy-based epigenomic data processing pipelines that provide easy-to-use “wizards” for standardized processing of common epigenomic data types; and 3) an easily de-ployable, open source software package as a means to disseminate data, tools, and discoveries via cloud services.

"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9928344,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2020,1186500,0.03748735527252945
"Advanced algorithms to infer and analyze 3D genome structures Project Summary For the past decade, the population-cell Hi-C technique has significantly improved our ability to discover genome-wide DNA proximities. However, because population Hi-C is based on a pool of cells, it will not help us reveal each single cell's 3D genome structure or understand cell-to-cell variability in terms of 3D genome structure and gene regulation. It is also difficult to achieve a high resolution, such as 1 Kbp, with population Hi- C; therefore, when finding and analyzing the spatial interactions for the promoter or enhancer regions typically associated with biologically-important regulatory elements, population Hi-C data's resolution is too low to be useful. Moreover, while we know that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a key role in the formation of genome 3D structures, the question is whether long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the process since lncRNAs have been found to recruit proteins needed for chromatin remodeling, and our preliminary research has found that lncRNA LINC00346 directly interacts with CTCF. Finally, while members of the bioinformatics community, including the PI, have developed many algorithms to reconstruct 3D genome structures based on population Hi-C data, important questions still must be answered regarding how 3D genome structures are involved in gene regulation and whether there are relationships between 3D genome structures and genetic and epigenetic features. The PI proposes to conduct leading research to overcome these challenges and address these questions. During the next five years, the PI will develop algorithms to reconstruct the 3D whole- genome structures for single cells and analyze cell-to-cell variabilities in terms of 3D genome structure and gene regulation. The PI will develop a deep learning algorithm to enhance the resolution of population Hi-C data to that of Capture Hi-C data (1 Kbp) so that we can make good use of the large amount of Hi-C data accumulated in the past decade. An online database will be built to allow the community to access both population and single-cell 3D genome structures in an integrated way. The PI will work with a cancer biologist to discover any lncRNAs that function as a scaffold to fine-tune the CTCF-cohesin protein complex, as well as two neuron scientists to develop a more complete understanding of gene regulation while considering 3D genome and other genetic and epigenetic features. Given the PI's track record and productivity, having three computational goals and two collaborative goals is not only feasible but computationally and biologically rewarding. In five years, once the proposed studies are accomplished, the PI should have established a uniquely independent place in the field of 3D genome, maintaining leading positions in inferring single-cell 3D genome structures, enhancing Hi-C data resolution, and building 3D genome databases, while establishing similar positions in reconstructing high-resolution 3D genome structures, finding lncRNAs' roles in the formation of genome structures, and understanding how 3D genome structures are involved in gene regulation. Project Narrative The three-dimensional (3D) structure of genome is critically important for gene regulation; and the abnormal 3D genome structures are often associated with diseases such as cancer. This proposal aims to reconstruct and analyze the 3D genome structures of thousands of individual cells, study how 3D genome structures participate in gene regulation, determine whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the formation of genome structures, and build an online knowledge base integrating 3D genome structures with other biological information.",Advanced algorithms to infer and analyze 3D genome structures,10027542,R35GM137974,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Neurons', 'Other Genetics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'base', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cohesin', 'deep learning algorithm', 'genome database', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional structure', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R35,2020,354694,0.019436690626602464
"Evolutionary Human Genomics: Demography, Natural Selection, and Transcriptional Regulation To be fully understood, the human genome must be considered in the context of evolution. The activities that have dominated human genomics for three decades — such as genome sequencing and annotation, interrogation with high-throughput biochemical assays, and the identification of associations between genetic variants and diseases — have been enormously informative, but these descriptive studies must eventually be understood within the theoretical framework of evolutionary genetics. We must continue to press forward from the what? to the why? and how? of human genetics.  The goal of my laboratory is to interpret high-throughput genomic data from an evolutionary perspective. Drawing from ideas and techniques in molecular evolution, population genetics, statistics, and computer science, we aim both to understand the evolutionary forces that have shaped human genomes, and to use evolution to shed light on the phenotypic importance of particular sequences. Our recent activities have focused in three major areas: (1)  reconstruction  of  features  of  human  evolution  based  on  genome  sequences;  (2)  prediction  of  the  fitness consequences  of  human  mutations;  and  (3)  the  study  of  transcriptional  regulation  and  its  evolution  in primates.   We have reported major findings in each of these areas, including the existence of gene flow from early modern humans to Eastern Neandertals, a map of fitness consequences for mutations across the human genome, and an analysis showing that the architecture of transcription initiation is highly similar at enhancers and promoters in the human genome.  Here we propose to extend our research substantially in each of these areas, working together with a broad range  of  experimental  and  theoretical  collaborators.    Our  new  goals  include  the  development  of  improved methods for reconstructing human demography, with a focus on ancient gene flow; extensions of our ancestral recombination graph (ARG) sampling methods to accommodate much larger samples sizes, with applications in association mapping and the detection of natural selection; two complementary machine-learning approaches for  improving  the  prediction  of  fitness  consequences  from  sequence  data;  an  experimental  collaboration  to leverage CRISPR-Cas9 screens in characterizing noncoding mutations; a multi-pronged study of the sequence determinants of RNA stability and their implications for the evolution of transcription units; and development of a new probabilistic model for turnover of regulatory elements.  Together, these projects will address a wide variety of fundamental questions about the function and evolution of sequences in the human genome. Vast quantities of genomic data are now available to describe patterns of genetic variation within  human populations and across species, and various measures of biochemical activity along the human  genome. These data need to be interpreted in light of the fundamental forces of mutation,  recombination, natural selection, and genetic drift that have shaped genetic variation. This  proposal describes a series of projects that make use of new computational, statistical, and  theoretical methods to address fundamental questions in human evolutionary genetics, including how  humans arose   from our archaic hominin and ape cousins, how human populations diverged from one  another, how new mutations influence human health and fitness, and how regulatory sequences  contribute to unique aspects of human biology.","Evolutionary Human Genomics: Demography, Natural Selection, and Transcriptional Regulation",9876220,R35GM127070,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Enhancers', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Primates', 'RNA Stability', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'computer science', 'fitness', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome annotation', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'promoter', 'reconstruction', 'statistics']",NIGMS,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R35,2020,479215,0.06382234753349283
"A database for high-resolution chromatin contact maps and human genetic variants Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, several landmarking consortia have accumulated large amounts of genomic data towards understanding the functions of human genome. The ENCODE project has annotated genome-wide regulatory elements. The Roadmap Epigenomic project has characterized tissue-speciﬁc variation in epigenetic state. The NIH Common Fund GTEx project has delineated tissue-speciﬁc gene expression and transcription regulation. The NIH Common Fund 4D Nucleome (4DN) project has revealed dynamic 3D chromatin organization in many cell and tissue types. Each of the aforementioned consortia has generated thousands or even tens of thousands of datasets, and provided different insights regarding human genome at an unprecedent scale and depth. However, the datasets generated from these consortia are isolated in terms of cell types and tissue types covered, how the data are stored, and the resolution of the genomic data. These gaps bring realistic data analysis challenges to biomedical researchers when they use these public datasets jointly in their research — they need to go through different data portals with heterogeneous processing pipelines, different data formats, and unmatched resolutions. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches to impute high-resolution chromatin contact maps, and integrate the high-resolution chromatin contact maps with transcriptional data available from GTEx project and epigenomic data from ENCODE/Roadmap. We plan to share the integrated data on a public web server with a multi-panel interactive visualization genome browser. The integrated data will provide an important resource for understanding of tissue-speciﬁc genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to integrate 4DN datasets with GTEx datasets and ENCODE/Roadmap datasets. The integrated datasets will be critical resource to unveil the mechanisms of the genetic variants identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies.

"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",10021007,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic agent', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Embryonic Development', 'Estrogens', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'biophysical model', 'gene interaction', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neurogenomics', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'social', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2020,356979,0.024804070761270933
"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is to catalog all functional elements in the human genome through the integration and analysis of high-throughput data. We propose to continue the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, DAC) which will provide support and leadership in analyzing and integrating data from the ENCODE project as well as work closely with other ENCODE groups including the Data Coordination Center. Our proposed DAC team (Zhiping Weng, Mark Gerstein, Manolis Kellis, Roderic Guigo, Rafael Irizarry, X. Shirley Liu, Anshul Kundaje, and William Noble) has expertise across a wide range of fields including transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, evolution, genomics and proteomics, regulatory RNA, biophysics, and computational biology, where they are the leaders in machine learning, statistical genetics, networks, and gene annotation. These investigators also have a history of successfully working collaboratively in large consortia, particularly with other ENCODE groups. Their publication records demonstrate their synergistic approach to producing high-impact science and useful resources that benefit the broader biomedical communities. The proposed DAC will pursue the following four aims: Aim 1. Analyze and integrate data and metadata from a broad range of functional genomics projects; Aim 2. Serve as an informatics resource by supporting the activities of the ENCODE Analysis Working Group; Aim 3. Create high-quality Encyclopedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes; Aim 4.

"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9952404,UM1HG009435,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'K-562', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2020,1496387,0.08600164618479822
"Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Myosins are a diverse and ubiquitous class of molecular motors that are responsible for generating much of the macroscopic force in the human body. The human genome encodes 38 different isoforms of myosin, and members of this group act as force sensors or generators for a diverse set of processes throughout the body. To serve this wide array of functions, each myosin isoform has been biophysically tuned for its physiological role. In fact, the tuning is so precise that missense variants in one myosin isoform, !-cardiac myosin, can cause a congenital cardiomyopathy that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in people under 30. And yet, it is unknown how particular variants cause disease, or how to infer the pathogenic potential for novel mutations.  Large differences in functional properties between myosin isoforms are not the result of large differences in coding sequence or overall topology. Neither foreknowledge of phylogeny nor crystal structure is sufﬁcient to predict an isoform's biophysical properties. Furthermore, mutations causing disease frequently occur in regions of the protein far from the site of their deleterious effects. Poor understanding of the biophysical regulation of motor function has hampered the development of pharmaceuticals and the interpretation of human genomic data.  My goal is to establish a mechanistic understanding of myosin motors that is capable of predicting if and how sequence variation changes biophysical properties and can cause cardiac disease. Since myosin kinetics are not apparent from sequence or overall structure, they must be determined by other factors. I hypothesize that kinetic differences result from differences in the allosteric networks in these proteins. Allosteric network in this context refers to the coordinated conformational ﬂuctuations that give protein regulation the appearance of action at a distance. To test this hypothesis, we will use our unique combination of enormous computational power for molecular simulation and cutting-edge machine learning tools for analyzing protein allostery.  Aim 1 is to identify the biophysical determinants of myosin isoforms' differing speeds. To test our hypothesis that allosteric networks are responsible for modulating dynamics, I will use molecular simulations of different myosin isoforms and compare their allosteric networks with biochemical data about their properties. Aim 1 directly addresses outstanding questions about normal molecular-biological function of the heart, putting it in line with NHLBI overarching objective #1.  Aim 2 is to determine the difference, at atomic resolution, between healthy and diseased !-cardiac myosin. I hypothesize that the pathogenicity of variants with an unknown molecular etiology is a consequence of allosteric disruption, and will use our computational tools to test this hypothesis by simulating a set of known-pathogenic variants. This aim uses techniques from data science to understand the genetic determinants of health, and will apply equally well to rare alleles in under-represented groups as to majority groups. It is directly addresses NHLBI overarching objectives #3, #4, and #7. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Myosins are a closely-related group of molecules that are responsible for generating much of the force in the human body, including the heartbeat, the movement of limbs, and driving food through the stomach and intestines. Small changes to the myosin genes can have large effects: in healthy people, these give rise to different myosins that perform different functions, and mutations in some myosin genes can give rise to diseases that cause of sudden cardiac death. This proposal aims to learn, at the level of atoms and interatomic bonds, why and how these subtle changes to the myosin gene can create such large effects in the protein's function.",Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations,9881184,F30HL146052,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Appearance', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Cardiac Myosins', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Catalysis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Congenital cardiomyopathy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Etiology', 'Food', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Intestines', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Motors', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Myosin ATPase', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient risk', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Resolution', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solvents', 'Speed', 'Stomach', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'computerized tools', 'disease-causing mutation', 'force sensor', 'genomic data', 'heart function', 'improved', 'insight', 'limb movement', 'member', 'millisecond', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'rare variant', 'rat Ran 2 protein', 'simulation', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,48719,-0.011301212917688205
"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,9902467,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'stem cells', 'tissue stem cells', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2020,324350,0.01427583792590661
"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer.

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs.

"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology.

"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few.

"A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer genomes typically harbor a substantial number of somatic mutations. Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE While coding cancer driver mutations have been characterized in detail over the past decade, the contribution of noncoding mutations to tumor formation remains - apart from few examples (e.g. mutations in TERT promoters) - largely unknown. Recently, large-scale whole-genome sequencing datasets have been made available, but a major bottleneck for the biological and clinical interpretation of these cancer whole-genome cohorts is the lack of statistical models that identify driver mutations in noncoding regions. We developed a new statistical approach that characterizes driver mutations based on their surrounding nucleotide context in coding regions, and herein we propose a concrete plan to generalize our computational model to noncoding regions, apply our model to aggregated whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients (PCAWG, HMF datasets), and define the noncoding driver and passenger mutational landscape for biological discovery and focused clinical application.",A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions,10260680,R21CA242861,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Attention', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenicity', 'large datasets', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predicting response', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'reference genome', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2020,177000,0.05197834112382766
"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9896829,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,312660,0.014943109052637503

Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE While coding cancer driver mutations have been characterized in detail over the past decade, the contribution of noncoding mutations to tumor formation remains - apart from few examples (e.g. mutations in TERT promoters) - largely unknown. Recently, large-scale whole-genome sequencing datasets have been made available, but a major bottleneck for the biological and clinical interpretation of these cancer whole-genome cohorts is the lack of statistical models that identify driver mutations in noncoding regions. We developed a new statistical approach that characterizes driver mutations based on their surrounding nucleotide context in coding regions, and herein we propose a concrete plan to generalize our computational model to noncoding regions, apply our model to aggregated whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients (PCAWG, HMF datasets), and define the noncoding driver and passenger mutational landscape for biological discovery and focused clinical application.",A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions,9957082,R21CA242861,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Attention', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenicity', 'large datasets', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predicting response', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'reference genome', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2020,193576,0.05197834112382766
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9873080,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'functional/structural genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'psychiatric genomics', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'stem cells', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,10090262,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,38074,0.05661179793253587

"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.
