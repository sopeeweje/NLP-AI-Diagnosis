"Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods The goal of this research proposal is to develop new in-silico approaches for accurate functional annotation of genetic and post-transcriptional variants. The rapid growth of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and high- throughput -omics data have brought us one step closer towards mechanistic understanding of the complex genetic disease, such as cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes, and others at the molecular level. In particular, these data revealed that complex diseases commonly manifest changes at the genetic and post- transcriptional levels. Bot of these types of changes often affect structure and function of the corresponding genes and their products. Understanding the functional implications of the genetic and post-transcriptional variation is an important task as it can provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Here, we propose to leverage novel machine learning paradigms to design computational methods for predicting the effect of genetic and alternative splicing variants on the macromolecular interactions. Macromolecular interactions underlie many cellular functions in a healthy organism. The disease-induced changes in the genes, such as single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and alternative splicing variations (ASVs) have been recently reported to cause the protein-protein interaction network rewiring. Unfortunately, the experimental high-throughput techniques that characterize the large-scale effects of SNVs or ASVs on PPIs are expensive, time-consuming, and far from being comprehensive. The current in-silico methods either suffer from the limited applicability, or are less accurate when compared with the experimental methods. To overcome these challenges, we will use two recent machine learning paradigms, learning under privileged information (LUPI) and semi-supervised learning. If successful, we expect for the proposed methods to provide the critical advancement in the two main challenges of the current computational approaches, the limited coverage and lower than the experimental accuracy. The methods will be freely available to the community as the stand-alone tools as well as web- servers. The goal of this proposal is to build computational tools that discover the links  between the disease-associated mutations as well as alternatively spliced protein isoforms  and the protein-protein interactions mediated by the disease proteins. The tools use advanced  machine learning methods to find such links in a fast and inexpensive way. These tools  will be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms implicated in the complex genetic disorders.",Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods,9730612,R21LM012772,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Cell physiology', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human Genome', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Organism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'gene function', 'gene product', 'genetic variant', 'human interactome', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'preservation', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'rapid growth', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NLM,WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R21,2019,193732,-0.018424950261241965
"Deep learning methods to predict the function of genetic variants in orofacial clefts Project Summary  Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations (ranging between 1/500 to 1/2500 live births) and represent a major public health challenge. Individuals born with OFCs require surgical, nutritional, dental, speech, medical and behavioral interventions, imposing a substantial economic and personal burden. There has been convincing evidence that non-syndromic OFCs represent human complex disorders with a multifactorial etiology including genetic risk factors, environmental exposures, and their complex interactions. So far, there have been ~10 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted for non-syndromic CL/P (NSCL/P) and >15 genomic loci reported with compelling statistical support, including genes such as IRF6, PAX7, and ABCA4 and the 8q24 locus. In addition, next-generation sequencing (NGS) as well as exome array have been conducted with extra depth of genotyping that enable detection of rare variants associated with OFCs. However, gaps exist in how to interpret these variants and how to identify novel variants from the large volume of data, with high expectations for new methods and new models for “second- analysis” of the genome-wide data. In this proposal, we propose two complementary aims to carry out deep and second-analysis of genome-wide data for OFCs. In Aim 1, we propose a deep learning method to build in silico models that can predict the effect of genetic variants in the context of rich craniofacial epigenomic features. With substantial fine map of sequence patterns, ad hoc motifs will be revealed and variants that disturb these motifs will provide mechanistic insights on OFCs. In Aim 2, we shift our focus to the gene level and propose a network assisted method to discover sensibly combined genes in spatial and temporal points that are critical to orofacial development. We target on all forms of OFCs, with particular interest in NSCL/P. To guarantee the success of this proposal, we form a multi-disciplinary team and local computational infrastructure equipped with GPUs for the implementation of both aims. Our aims are non-overlapping; rather, they are integrated and strongly focused on our fundamental question of interest: how genetic variants function to cause OFCs. The successful completion of our proposal will lead to deep understanding of genetic components in OFCs. Project Narrative Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations and represent a major public health challenge. Substantial progress has been made to identify genes and variants for OFCs through recent genome-wide association studies and next- generation sequencing projects. In this proposal, we aim to develop computational methods to comprehensively fine map and interpret the effects of these genetics variants, which will eventually lead to understanding of the mechanisms and new therapies for OFCs.",Deep learning methods to predict the function of genetic variants in orofacial clefts,9764346,R03DE027711,"['8q24', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft lip with or without cleft palate', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Explosion', 'Expression Profiling', 'FaceBase', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'PAX7 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'computer infrastructure', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'exome', 'expectation', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'orofacial development', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sequence learning', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'trait']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R03,2019,154000,0.07484340761984162
"A Multivariate Mediation and Deep Learning Framework for Genome-Connectome -Substance Use Research Substance use and addiction are complex biopsychosocial disorders influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. A key challenge in addiction genetics research is to understand how multiple genetic variants interactively influence addiction traits through impacting the central nervous system. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale mediation analysis framework to identify addiction-related gene-brain circuitry pathways, using nicotine addiction as the targeted disorder, although the platform will be readily applicable for other addiction-related disorders and phenotypes. We will fully leverage the complex and interactive interdependent relationships between the imaging-genetics data and perform multivariate statistical inference with simultaneously increased statistical power and reduce false positive rates. The results will precisely identify multiple sets of genetic variants that interactively alter brain functional and structural circuitries, and then influence nicotine addiction. We will further supplement the mediation results with deep learning algorithms to study how genetic variants non-linearly and interactively coordinate to influence nicotine addiction and explain the phenotypic variance. Novel network topology based convolutional and pooling functions will be developed to achieve optimal prediction accuracy of addiction traits using genome-connectome pathways. All models and findings will be carefully validated through multiple independent large-sample data sets of imaging-genetics studies for nicotine addiction for ensuring the replicability and reliability of our findings derived from this framework. We plan to produce a freely available and user-friendly software incorporating the mediation analysis framework and deep learning algorithms enabling the complex whole genome - connectome analysis for addiction genetics research. Nicotine addiction is a worldwide public health priority and imposing health and economic burden on millions of individuals and families. This proposal seeks to identify how multiple genetic variants interactively influence the nicotine addiction through impacting brain circuitries. The improved understanding of genome-connectome pathways of addiction could lead to more effective treatment and prevention.",A Multivariate Mediation and Deep Learning Framework for Genome-Connectome -Substance Use Research,9810163,DP1DA048968,"['Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Mediation', 'Modeling', 'Neuraxis', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'addiction', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain circuitry', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'health economics', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'public health priorities', 'trait', 'user friendly software', 'whole genome']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,DP1,2019,463500,0.023090602041886624
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,9661406,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Community Medicine', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,404309,0.008728221155157966
"Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks The goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods that will identify genes driving epistasis between quantitative trait loci. Genetic association studies in both humans and model organisms have been increasingly able to detect interactions among genetic variants that influence disease risk and pathogenesis. However, identifying which genes are represented by individual variants is a major challenge. Many variants influencing disease are situated between genes, and even those that are in genes may be representing an effect from a neighboring gene. In model organism studies the situation is even more problematic. In breeding experiments, genetic associations with phenotypes typically encompass large regions of DNA with many genes, and experimental follow-up to identify the genes responsible for the association is resource-intensive. To address this problem, we are developing computational tools to prioritize putative gene interactions in interacting genomic regions for biological follow-up. We use machine learning classifiers trained on functional gene-gene interaction networks and combinatorial optimization to identify likely candidate gene-gene interactions responsible for epistatic interactions between genomic regions. Our methods sift through enormous spaces of candidate interactions, retaining only those whose functional interactions identify as plausible for supporting the epistatic interaction. These tools hold promise to dramatically limit the resource-intensity of biological follow up of putative epistasis and to clarify the genetic architecture of complex disease. Genetic studies in humans and model organisms are critical to understanding how genes interact to influence disease. Standard association studies, however, do not identify individual genes, but rather large genetic regions containing many genes, and determining individual genes responsible for phenotypic effects requires resource-intensive biological follow-up experiments. We are developing computational methods to prioritize genes in these regions for biological follow-up, with the ultimate goal of speeding the discovery of novel roles of genes in disease.",Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks,9712956,R21LM012615,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Breeding', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Letters', 'Lower Organism', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'mutant', 'novel', 'supervised learning', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2019,223200,0.019888487322561165
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9672510,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2019,336445,0.026395505626329363
"Optimizing imputation for diverse populations in a distributed framework The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators. The goal of our project is to accelerate the discovery of DNA variation relevant to health and disease by analyzing data from over 225,000 ethnically and racially diverse patients that will undergo genome sequencing. Of particular importance is ensuring we have powerful statistical methods for analyzing data from underserved groups including U.S. minority populations.

"Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing Abstract  Modern genetics has identified many genetic variants that affect traits such as height, but most phenotypic variation still cannot be explained by these variants alone. Importantly, differences in environment often result in individual variation of traits—including disease risk and drug response—for different genotypes. These relationships are known as genotype by environment (GxE) interactions. For example, the sickle cell allele of hemoglobin S causes sickle cell anemia, but also provides a fitness advantage in the presence of malaria by conferring resistance to infection. However, there are few examples where the exact causal variants are known. Therefore, we need to develop new methodology for identifying more of these GxE interactions, to improve prediction of disease risk and treatment outcomes.  In this study, I will fill in the gap of knowledge in GxE interactions by establishing an experimental framework for identifying hundreds of causal GxE variants in parallel, providing the first comprehensive view of GxE causal variant landscape. Specifically, I will study how thousands of genetic variants between a laboratory yeast strain (BY) and a vineyard strain (RM) lead to their differences in growth upon stress and drug treatments, as one form of GxE interaction. In Aim 1, I will use a novel gene-editing technology that can detect the fitness effects of thousands of variants in one experiment, as shown in a pilot experiment. Using this method, I will be able to map hundreds of casual variants that contribute to growth differences under various conditions, such as carbon source, oxidative stress and drug treatment. In Aim 2, I will measure allele-specific mRNA expression (ASE) from BYxRM F1 hybrids in above-mentioned conditions and associate the mapped causal GxE variants, to identify GxE variants that influence growth rate through gene expression. Then, I will apply a machine learning model to predict causal GxE genes using the molecular features found in this study. By mapping causal GxE variants, linking them to gene expression and predicting causal genes through gene expression, I will establish a complete framework for accelerating the discovery of GxE interactions. Public Health Relevance The recent explosion of precision medicine based on genotype and mutations has enabled personalized treatment of diseases. However, how environmental factors influence the outcome of such treatments is not clear. By establishing a framework to study general principles and underlying molecular mechanisms of these gene-by-environment interactions, we will be able to integrate such knowledge in disease risk prediction and personalized treatment.",Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing,9678678,F31ES030282,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Models', 'Carbon', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactase', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meiotic Recombination', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Sickle Cell', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Hemoglobin', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'career', 'causal variant', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mRNA Expression', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'precise genome editing', 'precision medicine', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'segregation', 'skills', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,29016,0.05066128287047834
"Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is distinctive amongst the inflammatory/autoimmune joint diseases in that its onset is commonly preceded by cutaneous psoriasis (PsC). This provides an unparalleled opportunity for the identification of predictive biomarkers to determine which of the approximately 25% of psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) patients will develop PsA. Over the past decade, we have expanded our genetic study of PsV to focus on PsA, resulting in the collection of 1,279 PsA patients at Michigan, 743 of whom have already been subjected to GWAS. Initiated in 2007, the International Psoriatic Arthritis Research Team (IPART) has accumulated 1,919 Canadian PsA patients, of whom 1,370 have already been subjected to GWAS. In 2015, we completed a meta- GWAS of PsC and PsA involving a discovery cohort of 1,430 PsA cases and 1,417 controls, with 9,293 additional PsV replication samples (3,061 PsA, 3,110 PsC) and 13,670 controls. We detected 10 associations for PsA and 11 for PsC, as well as a new association for PsV. Utilizing an innovative core exome array to genotype additional cases and controls, we carried out the largest meta-GWAS of PsV to date (~40,000 subjects) and found 16 more susceptibility regions, highlighting the roles of interferon signaling and the NFB cascade, and demonstrating strong enrichment for psoriasis genetic signals in T-cell regulatory elements. Using machine learning to model ~200 genetic variants in our PsA vs. PsC GWAS, we achieved 82% area under receiver operator curve for distinguishing PsA vs PsC, with 98% accuracy among the top 10% of patients with the highest genetic load. We also carried out RNA-seq on mRNA and miRNA from 65 pairs of pre- and post-conversion samples from PsC patients who developed PsA. Suggestive of a shift from skin- focused to systemic autoimmunity, we found significant post-conversion enrichment for central memory CD4+ T-cell (CD4-Tcm) transcripts among the up-regulated genes. We also observed highly correlated pre- and post- conversion behaviors of 54 differentially-expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets, as well as multiple serum miRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed in PsA vs. PsC. A metabolomic study of 50 paired converter sera revealed 293 biochemicals with significant alterations, 275 of which were increased. Finally, we identified noncoding eQTLs for IL23R that correlate strikingly with a region of selective PsA association.  Based on these results, we hypothesize that PsA and PsC have pathogenetic mechanisms that are T-cell, osteoblast and osteoclast-driven and progress from skin to systemic during transition to PsA. We propose that this paradigm can be used to develop a useful test to predict PsA in PsC patients, while increasing our basic understanding of PsA. To test this hypothesis, we propose four aims: (1) to maintain and grow our longitudinal clinical resource; (2) To identify biomarkers for the development of PsA in PsC patients; (3) To integrate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2 into a clinically-useful tool for PsA identification using machine learning ; and (4) to explore the mechanisms by which the IL23R gene contributes to PsA pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. The mechanisms that predispose patients with psoriasis to develop PsA are unknown. The proposed research will utilize the power of genome-wide association studies, transcriptome analysis, metabolomics, and the largest longitudinal resource of PsA in the world to develop a clinically-relevant tool for PsA prediction and to address a major gap in our mechanistic understanding of the causes of PsA.

"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants.

"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified.

"Algorithms to identify non-coding mutational burden and disease-relevant pathways PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a disease with complex, polygenic etiology with numerous contributing mechanisms. To devise new therapeutics to combat this epidemic, we need to identify causal genes and variants for T2D and related, cardiometabolic traits implicated by human genetic association. Recently, large- scale DNA biobanks attached to electronic health records have facilitated extensive phenotyping in surprising large sample sizes (>500,000 subjects), importantly in diverse ancestries. These data have enabled a dramatic expansion of the number of bona-fide associations for T2D and related traits. While the increase in statistical power is certainly welcome, new opportunities for how to use these data require new computational methods and analytical pipelines. In this renewal, we focus on three areas for new methods development, which we will create and subsequently deploy to accelerate the genetic dissection for cardiometabolic disease. First, the number of associated loci now available permit the opportunity to learn directly from the data, which non- coding sequences functionally relate to T2D risk. We propose to utilize techniques in machine learning to make predictions for T2D and related causal traits, used to identify and prioritize causal variants and functional elements that are disease-predictive. A second challenge is that the quantity and pace at which this data is being produced is outstripping the rate at which even highly expert quantitative scientists can explore and extract novel insights from the data. To combat this problem, we propose to develop an informatics toolkit with apps to perform compute-intensive, important analyses and visualization with these data, tethered to cloud- based or local computation infrastructure. Finally, one key observation that follows biobank-based data analysis is that, at each physically distinct associated locus, numerous additional conditionally independent associations segregate nearby. This series of alleles can be identified through existing methods, but their use in causal inference approaches (i.e., Mendelian Randomization) has not been extensively explored. Here, we will evaluate their utility and develop statistical pipelines to use this spectrum of variation to perform new causal inference studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identification of causal variants and genes underlying type-2 diabetes (T2D) and related cardiometabolic trait associations are key challenge impeding biological understand and therapeutic developments. New, large- scale data sets from DNA biobanks are poised to help overcome these challenges but require the development of new informatics and statistical methods to take full advantage of the data. In this renewal application, we will develop new methods, machine learning applications, informatics tools, and causal inference statistical approaches to identify pinpoint casual variants and genes contributing to T2D and related traits.",Algorithms to identify non-coding mutational burden and disease-relevant pathways,10007107,R56DK101478,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Catalogs', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Human Genetics', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'burden of illness', 'cardiometabolism', 'causal variant', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'combat', 'computer infrastructure', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'insight', 'instrument', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'parallelization', 'power analysis', 'task analysis', 'therapeutic development', 'trait']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R56,2019,272474,0.045720605853791896
"NEIGHBORHOOD Consortium for POAG Genetics Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure (IOP) related, progressive optic neuropathy that ultimately leads to blindness. Permanent visual field loss from POAG is a condition of public health significance worldwide. The etiology of POAG is poorly understood and primary prevention is not possible. Current treatments can slow but do not cure this progressive neuropathy. The overall goal of our research is to elucidate the pathogenesis of POAG allowing for implementation of effective screening and prevention strategies and development of novel therapies. POAG has significant heritability and recent genome-wide association studies, including our NEIGHBORHOOD GWAS, have identified 30 POAG loci defined by common genomic variants. However, in addition to common variants the complex POAG genetic architecture is likely to also include contributions from rare coding variants as has been discovered for other complex traits. Large-scale studies of rare coding variation and glaucoma have not yet been done. Of the current POAG loci, the majority appear to contribute to disease through elevation of IOP. However, approximately one third of U.S. glaucoma cases are ‘normal’ tension (NTG), charaterized by progressive optic nerve degeneration despite normal IOP. Our prior NTG GWAS identified two loci: 8q22, a loci not found in POAG GWASs and CDKN2BAS, a locus known to effect ganglion cell vulnerability. There results suggest that genes associated with NTG can influence susceptiblity to optic nerve degeneration, and that identification of these optic-nerve-related loci is more likely using NTG cases and controls for GWAS, rather than POAG overall. For the next funding period we propose the following specific aims: 1) complete a larger-scale well-powered NTG GWAS to discover novel loci; 2) assess contributions of rare coding variants to NTG and high-tension POAG (HTG) using whole exome sequencing; 3) explore potential protective effects of dietary factors and medications on cases with high-risk variants in POAG loci related to lipid metabolism and to mitochondrial function; and 4) support additional clinical data collection for the NEIGHBORHOOD. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) causes permanent loss of vision and is a condition of public health significance worldwide, affecting millions of people. The etiology of POAG is poorly understood and effective means of primary prevention and curative therapies are not available. In this proposal, our collaborative consortium will complete genetic studies to identify risk factors for POAG and the normal tension subgroup with the ultimate goals of developing effective screening and prevention strategies and novel therapies targeted to the molecular events responsible for the disease.",NEIGHBORHOOD Consortium for POAG Genetics,9819220,R01EY022305,"['ATP binding cassette transporter 1', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Blindness', 'CAV1 gene', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dietary Factors', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropathy', 'Optic Nerve', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention therapy', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Visual Fields', 'Vitamin B Complex', 'case control', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'ganglion cell', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'lipid metabolism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optic nerve disorder', 'protective effect', 'protective factors', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2019,872775,0.03751231010278915
"Genetic determinants of puberty and later life health outcomes My long-term objective is to build on my existing track record in understanding the genetic mechanisms that influence differences in pubertal developmental timing and how they impact associated adverse health outcomes. Puberty is a key adolescent developmental milestone that is strongly associated with later life health outcomes, such as poor cardiometabolic health, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and osteoporosis. Hundreds of genetic variants across the genome are known to affect the timing of puberty (assessed by age at menarche in girls and age at voice break in boys), but the sex-specific impact of this genetic variation on health outcomes in adolescence and adulthood remain poorly characterized, particularly for boys. Furthermore, another key puberty trait, the pubertal height growth spurt, is less well characterized genetically, but reflects influences from pubertal timing, height growth potential, and body mass, and deeper investigation may reveal novel insights into the links between puberty and health outcomes. During the mentored K99 phase of this proposal, I will use a machine learning approach to choose the best variants across the genome that predict pubertal timing to build optimized polygenic scores (Aim 1a). These male and female-specific polygenic scores will then be tested for association across hundreds of clinical outcomes in biobanks composed of electronic health records (EHR) in tens of thousands of children and adults (Aim 1b). Subsequently, in the independent R00 phase, I will use causal inference analyses to understand the causal impact of genetically determined pubertal timing on identified health outcomes (Aim 1c). Meanwhile, I will combine what I have learned during Aim 1 with my previous expertise to lead a genome-wide association study of the pubertal height growth spurt in the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) consortium, combining longitudinal data from ~35,000 children across multiple cohorts, followed by trans-ethnic fine-mapping (Aim 2a). Finally, I will apply the pipeline developed in Aim 1 to derive PGS for pubertal growth and determine clinically relevant health outcomes linked to differences in pubertal growth trajectories (Aims 2b-d). In this Pathway to Independence proposal, I will complete training in computational and biomedical informatics techniques to capitalize on large-scale data resources, including linked genetic and EHR data from medical and population-based biobanks and longitudinal adolescent cohorts in the EGG consortium. My mentorship committee is composed of a team of world-renowned experts in genomics, informatics, and computational approaches, who have a strong track record in transitioning postdoctoral fellows into independent researchers. Combining my previous expertise with the proposed research and training objectives, together with a strong mentorship team, the securing of EGG leadership in this phenotypic area, and career development activities, I will be uniquely poised to achieve my goal of transitioning to an independent researcher with the skills needed to advance our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of pubertal development and its linked adult outcomes. This research will reveal novel understanding of the sex-specific molecular regulation of pubertal timing and how differences in pubertal timing are related to adverse adult health outcomes. This work will ultimately lead to studies that identify key areas where early interventions may mitigate the negative health effects of earlier or later than average pubertal timing, which serves the NICHD’s mission of ensuring that all children achieve their full potential for healthy lives.",Genetic determinants of puberty and later life health outcomes,9805815,K99HD099330,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age at Menarche', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Menarche', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention strategy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Factors', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Work', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'boys', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'girls', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'male', 'men', 'novel', 'phenome', 'population based', 'pubertal timing', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K99,2019,131733,0.012108629750608434
"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients. Here we will identify new genes that cause these disorders and evaluate mutations in silico, in a cellular assay, and in whole animals to better predict the disease course in each patient. Treatment options associated with the type of individual patient mutations will also be explored, bringing individualized medicine to these diseases.",ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations,9778816,R01DK058816,"['Age', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Budgets', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cyst', 'Cystic kidney', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Other Genetics', 'PRKCSH protein', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proprotein Convertase 1', 'Proprotein Convertase 2', 'Proteins', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'base', 'disease phenotype', 'dosage', 'early onset', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'polycystic liver disease', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'protein folding', 'screening', 'therapy development', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,510292,0.03800122608688553
"Micropublications for Automating Genome Sequence Variant Interpretation from Medical Literature PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate and efficient interpretation of genomic variants for clinical decision making is predicated on ready access to useful information in the medical literature. The sheer number of potentially relevant articles that must be examined during this curation process poses a major challenge in ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of clinical variant interpretation as it is time-consuming and the results highly user-dependent. To this end, we have developed the Mastermind Genomic Search Engine - a commercial database that automatically organizes disease, gene and variant information from the medical literature by systematically indexing millions of scientific articles. In direct comparison to manually developed databases of genetic variants, we have achieved greater than 97% concordance and accurately identified >50% more variants with an average of 3-fold more references demonstrating the effectiveness of our automated approach. Currently, Mastermind is used by over 1800 variant scientists in 25 different countries to more quickly curate literature for genetic variants in clinical settings. In response to feedback from ClinGen curators and others, the present proposal seeks to create a framework to facilitate literature curation and clinical variant interpretation activities within Mastermind by 1) prioritizing relevant references and external database entries containing content meaningful to variant classification guidelines, 2) assembling this information into a “micropublication” text format with codified data fields including population frequencies, computational predictions, reference citations and relevant sentence fragments with conclusive content, 3) allowing users to manually review, alter and augment pre-populated entries and 4) providing a platform to share and continuously update this information with other variant scientists in the Mastermind community and elsewhere. Developing tools that allow for collaborative curation in real-time at the point of interaction with source material (i.e. individual articles) will mitigate reproducibility challenges plaguing other large-scale crowd-sourced projects. In contrast to genetic variant databases of user submitted classification information and associated data, the present proposal seeks to create enhanced curation tools to fill such variant databases with more accurate and reproducible data and in a way that would promote dramatic scaling of variant curation activities including those undertaken by groups like ClinVar. To test this approach, we will work with industry partners engaged in variant curation activities to 1) determine the requisite data fields, 2) integrate external database information, 3) test the accuracy and relevance of results and the overall efficacy of the approach using hundreds of manually curated genetic variants, and 4) solicit and incorporate feedback from our development partners to iterate and refine the software features for the greatest effect. Within the $4B genome sequencing software market, there is significant commercial potential and scientific merit in bringing more automated techniques of data analysis to large-scale genome sequencing variant interpretation as described in this proposal. [Word count – 447; Line count - 30] PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful completion of the present project will contribute to the public health mission of the NIH by promoting more widespread adoption of genome sequencing by making the interpretation of genome variant data more accurate, reproducible and cost-effective in clinical and research laboratories.

"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,9786811,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'regression algorithm', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,190941,0.050193593990260084
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population. Such variants offer great potential for understanding the functional impact of risk alleles and improving mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and related disorders.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families,9749268,R01MH114593,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ireland', 'LGALS3BP gene', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'offspring', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'working group']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,430191,0.04674906607855183
"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases. We will focus on the development of methods that are able to detect synergistic effects of multiple genetic variants regardless of whether they are rare of common in human populations.

"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,9739114,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Cell Death', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Deacetylation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HDAC7 histone deacetylase', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous body substance', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic platform', 'healthspan', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel strategies', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'programs', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,483750,0.031541113473875476
"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9616870,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'population stratification', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,297373,0.06619745084806235
"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9693289,U01HG009086,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Government', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biobank', 'cost', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sciences', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,864186,0.010138887094542224
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9757833,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2019,4129117,0.026417542731804796
"Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Abnormalities in heart rate, cardiac conduction (PR and QRS) and repolarization (QT) measured on the ECG predispose to the clinically important cardiac arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) / sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examine the genomic basis of these ECG endophenotypes in order to deconstruct arrhythmias into more proximate traits and discrete components, allowing us to better understand underlying mechanisms, provide insight into arrhythmia generation, and help target development of novel therapies.  The molecular architecture of cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias is not fully understood, but likely involves genomic, epigenomic, and environmental influences. Over the past 10 years, we have identified numerous common loci associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias, yet these common variants account for only a portion of the heritability of electrophysiologic and arrhythmic phenotypes. The agnostic examination of genotype-phenotype associations employed in genome- wide association studies (GWAS) does not incorporate knowledge of functional genomic regions or important biologic relationships. Additionally, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms connecting mostly intergenic and intronic GWAS signals to phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that a systems biology approach integrating genetic sequence variation with omic data (epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) will uncover novel associations and elucidate biologic mechanisms associated with arrhythmia-related phenotypes. We further hypothesize that examining the simultaneous association between sequence variation and multiple cardiac electrophysiologic phenotypes will help uncover additional novel mechanisms associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias.  TOPMed's combination of rich phenotype data, with whole genome sequence (WGS), epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, provides a unique opportunity to more comprehensively explore these hypotheses. We leverage sequence, omic, and phenotype data from multiple cohort studies to efficiently and cost-effectively examine and dissect association of omic factors with cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia risk. Our application is an ambitious yet eminently feasible effort that integrates clinical, genetic, and systems biology expertise. We aim to discover associations using omics data (Aims 1 and 2) and elucidate specific genes and biologic pathways underlying these associations (Aims 3 and 4). Our ultimate goal is to identify pathways, genes, and genetic variation that are clinically relevant, and therefore potentially the target of new therapies, diagnostics, or risk predictions. Narrative Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This proposal aims to use genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, combined with complex systems biology and pleiotropic analyses, to better understand the underlying pathways and genes involved in normal electrophysiology and arrhythmia formation. The identification of biologic factors that influence cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias will provide insight into the mechanisms of arrhythmia generation, and perhaps identify better targets for drug development and prevention.",Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias.,9737693,R01HL141989,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'heart electrical activity', 'insight', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'rare variant', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,490901,0.01760169391310723
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease.

"Integrate gene expression data to characterize the contribution of rare genetic risk factors to structural birth defects Project Summary  We aim to maximize discovery of new risk genes and elucidate the genetic architecture of structural birth defects. To achieve that, we propose cross-disease genetic analysis of both protein-coding and noncoding variants and integration of gene expression data to prioritize candidate risk genes.  Better understanding of the genetic basis of structural birth defects will lead to new insights into human developmental biology and will provide targets for medical intervention and treatment. Recent large-scale genome and exome sequencing studies of birth defects have identified new risk genes, especially through the analysis of de novo variants in protein coding regions. However, we are still far from complete understanding of the genetic causes of birth defects. Estimates are that there are 400- 800 risk genes of large effect size for birth defects such as congenital heart disease, and the vast majority of these genes are unknown. This is primarily due to the lack of statistical power. While increasing sample size is essential and is part of the core deliverables of the Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF) programs, we also need to develop and apply new analytical methods that improve power and maximize the utility of the available genetic data by using other types of data and biological knowledge. In addition, in most prior studies, the analysis of rare genetic variation has been focused on small variants in the coding regions or large copy number variants (CNV). The data and methods to interrogate the contribution of rare noncoding variants is rudimentary, limiting our understanding of genetic architecture of these diseases. In this study, we propose two aims to address these questions by leverage GMKF cross-disease whole genome sequencing data sets: Specific Aim 1. Elucidate genetic architecture by cross-disease analysis of rare coding and non-coding variants. Specific Aim 2. Integrate gene expression with genome sequencing data to improve discovery and biological interpretation of risk genes of structural birth defects.  The proposed study will maximize the genetic discovery potential of the GMKF WGS data sets for birth defects and improve our understanding of the pleiotropic effects and tissue specificity of risk genes and variants. The analytical approaches developed in this study will be applicable to genetic data of birth defects and developmental disorders from future GMKF cohorts and other programs.

"Cardiac genetic effects across HLBS phenotypes Forward genetic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully mapped thousands of loci regulating disorders of the heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS), implicating widespread sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, their functions, mechanisms of action and how they impact disease is still unclear. To solve this new and important GWAS bottleneck, we use a functional genomics-inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the `transcriptional machinery' (transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), target genes) controlling HLBS-relevant tissue functions and how DNA variants in them affect HLBS diseases. Taking advantage of our long-standing expertise and successes in complex, cardiovascular disorders, and novel computational methods we have recently developed, we propose novel genomics analyses of the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program phenotypes and their whole genome sequences, together with publicly available epigenomics data, to identify the molecular bases of HLBS disease. We will first focus on the transcriptional machinery controlling heart physiology and its disorders before exploring other HLBS-relevant tissues and disorders in collaboration with other TOPMed investigators. Our specific aims are: (1) Identifying the transcriptional machinery in the heart and other HLBS relevant tissues; and, (2) Connecting genomic variation in the transcriptional machinery to HLBS traits. Our approach will enable identification of the core molecular components that control HLBS tissues and how they are compromised in HLBS disorders. The major hypothesis explaining the results of heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific HLBS genes and, thereby, modulate variation in the phenotype and disorders. In this proposal, we advance new computational approaches to identify the `transcriptional machinery' (TF, CRE, target genes) controlling HLBS-relevant tissue functions so that the effects of causal genetic variation can be identified within identified trait loci genome- wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding HLBS trait and disease variation, a major public health challenge.",Cardiac genetic effects across HLBS phenotypes,9692018,R01HL141980,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Blood', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'causal variant', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'reverse genetics', 'success', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,436249,0.025597486635955197
"Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing of complex diseases have revealed a plethora of disease risk variants, most of which lie in noncoding regions of DNA without easily interpretable function. A main functional mechanism of noncoding variants is to alter chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), thereby influencing gene expression. Predicting the effects of noncoding variants on TF binding and gene expression on a large scale is thus important but remains challenging. Available computational tools for predicting regulatory variants largely rely on TF-binding motif models and/or local chromatin modification features. Here, we aim to develop a novel computational framework to address two major limitations of these methods. First, given that known disease causal noncoding variants often reside outside of TF binding motifs, how can we improve the prediction of TF binding variants outside of motifs? For this, we plan to integrate TF ChIP-seq data with features that are important for TF binding but have not been considered in previous methods, in particular the DNA breathing dynamics (AIM1). DNA breathing reflects local transient opening of the DNA double helix due to thermal fluctuations. We have shown that genetic variants can affect nearby (up to a few hundred base pairs) DNA breathing dynamics that affect TF binding. Using TF ChIP-seq data, we will train models that predict specific TF binding variants in or outside TF motifs, incorporating DNA breathing dynamics with other features such as DNA shapes and cooperative TF binding. Secondly, given that chromatin features only show modest (<2-fold) enrichment of genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits, how can we improve the prediction of regulatory variants? For this, we will build a computation model, considering the allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA; i.e., two alleles of a heterozygous individual show read imbalance in chromatin accessibility assays) as a functional readout of a regulatory variant (AIM2). We have shown that neuronal ASCA SNPs are highly enriched for those implicated by schizophrenia (SZ) GWAS. Using neuronal ASCA data, we will train models that predict variants with regulatory effects, taking advantage of our TF-specific classifiers (from AIM1). As a proof of concept, the models will be applied to a large SZ GWAS dataset to predict putative causal regulatory variants. We will validate the effects of the predicted top-ranking regulatory SZ variants on gene expression in a well-powered hiPSC sample by combining multiplex CRISPR-based SNP editing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis (AIM3). For SNPs showing the strongest regulatory effects, we will further use CRISPR editing to verify the SNP effect on gene expression and disease-relevant neuronal phenotypes. Accurately predicting TF-affecting noncoding variants will enable better understanding of the large number of noncoding variants implicated in complex disorders and help formulate testable biological hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapeutics. NARRATIVE We will develop novel computational methods and a cost-effective functional validation approach to systematically infer the effect of disease-associated noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and gene expression. Identifying the functional noncoding variants that are associated with disease risk will help illuminate causal molecular mechanisms, facilitating the clinical translation of genetic findings into disease risk prediction and treatment.",Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants,9670347,R01MH116281,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adenine', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cell Line', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'chromatin modification', 'clinical translation', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost effective', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIMH,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2019,672622,0.05423559736077329
"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion. Estimates based on common variants and between- species substitutions are confounded by natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion (BGC). Methods relying on incidence rates of monogenic diseases or finding de novo variants by trio sequencing can inform global trends, but do not provide sufficient data to assess fine-scale local parameters. This study will overcome these limitations by using the extremely rare variants (ERVs) as a new data source to characterize patterns of recent germline variation in humans. ERVs, defined in this study as singletons in 30,000 samples, are becoming available via large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of population samples. Unlike common variants or substitutions, ERVs arose very recently and are largely unaffected by selection, BGC, etc. We will analyze 200-300 million singleton variants observed in 30,000 subjects at 20-30X coverage. The regional distribution of ERV subtypes will establish a quantitative atlas of the rate and spectrum of human germline mutations mostly unaltered by selection. We will share this resource with the research community and apply it to determine the impact of local genomic features and epigenomic attributes. We will use the systematic departures between ERVs and variants of higher frequencies (polymorphisms and substitutions) to infer local effects of selection, and this may uncover hitherto unknown functional regions of the genome. By comparing mutation signatures in ERVs with those in somatic variations observed in diverse cancers we will attribute distinct mutational signatures to known biochemical processes and thus infer the major contributors to new germline mutations in the human genome. This subtype-specific atlas will also be used to predict the probability of observing every possible single-base mutation in the genome, thus facilitating the interpretation of candidate causal variants of human diseases. We will assess mutation pattern differences among European Americans, African Americans and Latinos, and seek to discover genetic modifiers of germline mutation rate by finding functionally damaging mutations that show increased ERV counts in the surrounding genomic region, potentially identifying both known and previous unknown ""mutator"" genes that play a role in transmission fidelity in humans. This research will provide an essential resource to study the genesis and maintenance of germline mutations in humans. Understanding such a fundamental process will be the basis for a deeper understanding of human evolution and diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will study the patterns of inherited mutations in humans using approximately 250 million extremely rare DNA variants in human populations. Our results will allow the prediction of the rate of new mutations at every site in the genome based on features of the surrounding DNA sequence, thus providing a common resource to study the arrival and maintenance of mutations in humans. Understanding such a basic process is important for answering fundamental questions in human evolution, the cause of inherited diseases, and the role of DNA abnormality in cancer and aging.",High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms,9702844,R01GM118928,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'European', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'causal variant', 'data sharing', 'density', 'driving force', 'epigenomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'next generation sequencing', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'repository', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'web server', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,300191,0.026730130702277463
"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",9645655,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,615264,0.02539951979205587
"Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks Abstract Accurately detecting structural variation in the genome is a challenging task. Many approaches have been developed over the last few decades, yet it is estimated that tens of thousands of variants are still being missed in a given sample. Many of these variants are missed due to the limitations of using short-read sequencing to identify large variants. Although many of these missed variants are located within complex regions of the genome, it has been shown that some still have clinical relevance making their discovery important. New platforms have been developed for sequencing the genome using long-reads and show promise for overcoming many of these limitations creating the ability to identify the full spectrum of simple and complex structural variants. Because this technology is relatively young, new computational approaches to support the analysis of long-read sequencing data can aid in the discovery of these variants which are still being missed. In addition to detecting novel variation in samples with long-read sequencing data, computational approaches can be developed to leverage these novel variant calls to reanalyze the hundreds of thousands of short-read datasets currently available. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational approaches to identify novel structural variation in the genome. In Aim 1, we will apply a recurrence approach to analyze long read sequencing datasets utilizing deep neural networks. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool to derive profiles of structural variants predicted in long- reads which can be used to identify and genotype structural variants calls in short read data-sets. Together, these approaches will allow researchers to accurately characterize structural variation in both long and short- read datasets. Narrative Structural variation has been implicated in numerous human diseases but there are still tens of thousands of variants being overlooked in the genome. The proposed research aims to detect novel variation by developing new computational tools to analyze data generated by state-of-the-art sequencing methods. These tools will aid in the discovery of variants associated with human health.",Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks,9755117,F31HG010569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Label', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'structural genomics', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2019,37153,0.034183489697898424
"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis,9675210,R01AR070139,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Differentiation and Growth', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Haplotypes', 'High Prevalence', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'cartilage cell', 'causal variant', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'spatiotemporal', 'whole genome']",NIAMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,836792,0.04684794729558352
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,9593020,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Tests', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'hard of hearing', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing loss phenotype', 'hearing preservation', 'hearing threshold', 'hereditary hearing loss', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,480576,0.058753033392126466
"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care.

"Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease Project Summary/ Abstract  Over the past decade there has been a rapid expansion of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as the development of large-scale consortia like the UKBioBank and the All of Us project. While the number of genetic associations to human traits and disease is soaring, tools to characterize and interpret these variants are lacking. One challenge to realizing the potential of genomics is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, regulatory sequences. However, ‘regulatory grammar’ – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with transcription factors to control gene expression, is poorly understood. A repertoire of well-characterized causal variants is needed to build generalizable models with which to unlock insights into the genetic basis of human health and history.  Natural selection is a powerful driver of human genetic variation. As our species has encountered new climates, dramatic alterations in diet, and novel pathogens, these selective pressures have left hundreds of signatures of adaptation in our genomes, reflected in our species’ diversity of disease risk and morphology. For selection to have acted positively on them, these adaptive alleles must exhibit relatively strong phenotypic effects, and they continue to contribute to modern traits and disease (e.g. height or sickle cell anemia). Salient examples of human adaptation include immunity, metabolism, and morphology, all of which have extensive, unresolved GWAS signals. This renders the lens of recent evolution a powerful, but underutilized, tool for identifying alleles that contribute to phenotypic variation in modern association studies.  This proposal aims to expand the repertoire of well-characterized GWAS signals, by A) using evolution to prioritize adaptive variants, and B) applying novel, high-throughput experimental and computational tools to comprehensively decipher the functions of regulatory variants. These approaches will identify much needed causal variants, devise paradigms for their study, and inform future predictive models to characterize them. During the mentored phase of the K99, I will first develop methods to colocalize signals of selection and GWAS, and then use Variant Effect Predictions (VEP) to predict their function. I will then employ high-through methods such as a the massively parallel reporter assay and CRISPR non-coding screen to functionally characterize them directly. From the adaptive GWAS alleles our screens identify, we will make in-vivo system to more deeply characterize them during the Independent R00 phase. During this time I will deploy a variety of genomic tools such as ChIP, ChIA-PET, and RNA-seq to understand the adaptive variants’ molecular etiology. I will use the empirical data fro these studies, and the MPRA/HCR-FlowFISH screens to build more accurate VEP models. ! Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to identify adaptive human alleles underlying genome wide association studies and comprehensively characterize them using novel computational and experimental tools. I will then make in-vivo models of these to test their function and effects on fitness, improving future predictions of how genetic variants impact human evolution and health.",Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease,9805238,K99HG010669,"['African', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'CCRL2 gene', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Climate', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Height', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Immunity', 'Lassa Fever', 'Left', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Selections', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic tools', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'lens', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2019,124916,0.049647699349312735
"Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance Reduced insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance (IR) is a forerunner of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Differences in the prevalence of IR among ethnic groups suggest its genetic etiology. However, recent studies implementing genetic association approaches were only nominally successful in defining the genetically-regulated molecular and cellular mechanisms of IR. Our physiologic and genomic studies suggest that (a) IR results from derangement in expression of thousands of genes in tissues involved in glucose homeostasis, and (b) genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), determine the expression level of a subset of IR-associated genes. Thus, transcript levels are key molecular phenotypes associated with IR and are proximal to the action of genetic variants. A subset of genetically-regulated transcript subnetworks that operate within the large highly interconnected global expression networks in disease-relevant tissues can cause IR, but remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that, regulatory SNPs in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) determine transcript levels of key driver genes, configure the expression subnetworks in adipose and muscle tissue, and are causal determinants for IR. The genetic architecture of eQTLs determines the heterogeneity in causal mechanisms of IR. Our preliminary data support the concept of causal genetic regulators of subnetworks in modulating insulin sensitivity. Challenging the current paradigms, our Aim 1 is to implement our cutting-edge Multiscale Network Modelling Approach to integrate measures of glucose homeostasis (SI and Matsuda index from FSIVGT and OGTT, respectively); adipose and muscle tissue transcript profiles; eSNP data from African American participants in the AAGMEx cohort (N=260); and genetic and epigenetic regulation data from knowledge bases to discover subnetworks and genetic drivers that are causally linked to IR. In Aim 2, we will validate insulin sensitivity-associated genetically-regulated subnetworks, and determine common and ethnically-predominant genetic regulatory mechanisms of IR, using multi-omics data from similarly phenotyped European ancestry individuals from the METSIM (N=770) and AREA (N=99) cohorts. These results will be compared with those from the AAGMEx cohort. Key driver genes of insulin sensitivity-associated genetically regulated adipose and muscle tissue subnetworks from Aims 1-2 will then be prioritized based on statistical ranking to validate their regulatory roles. In Aim 3, we will focus on understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms modulated by 10 selected putative key regulatory genes. Using in vitro genetic perturbation experiments in relevant human cell models we have already established, we will modulate the expression of these genes, identify target pathways, and examine IR-determining cellular mechanisms (e.g. metabolism, signal transduction, differentiation, inflammation, cell-cell interaction) regulated by these genes. Our study will be among the first to define the genetic regulatory networks of IR, a key step towards development of novel therapeutic options for prevention of IR and subsequent T2D. Deciphering the underlying molecular defects and genetic regulatory mechanisms of insulin sensitivity is an unmet need to develop novel and safe therapeutic options to prevent insulin resistance and progression to type 2 diabetes and other diseases of major public health importance. Building on our success in recruiting cohorts of metabolically well-characterized and molecularly profiled non-diabetic African and European Ancestry individuals, and creating a data resource that is suitably powered to conduct integrative multi-omics analysis, we will implement a novel computational approach to discover fat and muscle tissue gene regulatory networks and driver genes that are causally linked to insulin resistance. Leveraging expertise of our multidisciplinary research team in cell and molecular biological studies this project will define mechanistic roles for the computationally predicted key regulatory genes in determining insulin resistance and thus help inform new strategies to treat and even prevent the rapidly growing public-health challenge of type 2 diabetes, particularly among African Americans.",Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance,9728964,R01DK118243,"['Adipose tissue', 'African', 'African American', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Muscle', 'Network-based', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'causal model', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'density', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic phenotype', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'small hairpin RNA', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,347047,0.015869907181258032
"Novel Statistical methods for DNA Sequencing Data, and applications to Autism. Summary One of the major problems in human genetics is understanding the genetic causes underlying complex phenotypes, including neuropsychiatric traits such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Despite tremendous work over the past few decades, the underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood in most cases. Recent advances in high-throughput, massively parallel genomic technologies have revolutionized the field of human genetics and promise to lead to important scientific advances. Despite this progress in data generation, it remains very challenging to analyze and interpret these data. The main focus of this proposal is the development of powerful statistical methods for the integration of whole-genome sequencing data with rich functional genomics data with the goal to improve the discovery of genes involved in autism spectrum disorders. We propose to integrate data from many different sources, including epigenetic data from projects such as ENCODE, Roadmap, and PsychENCODE, eQTL data from the GTEx, PsychENCODE and CommonMind consortia, data from large scale databases of genetic variation such as ExAC and gnomAD, in order to predict functional effects of genetic variants in non-coding genetic regions in a tissue and cell type specific manner, and generate functional maps across large number of tissues and cell types in the human body that we can then use to identify novel associations with autism in whole-genome sequencing studies. The proposed functional predictions and functional maps will be broadly available in the popular ANNOVAR database. We further propose to use these functional predictions in the analysis of almost 20,000 whole genomes from three large whole genome sequencing studies for autism. We believe that the proposed research is very timely and has the potential to substantially improve the analysis of non-coding genetic variation, and hence provide new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying risk to autism, and more broadly to other neuropsychiatric diseases. Narrative Autism Spectrum Disorders are common diseases with major impact on public health. Although coding variation has been extensively studied for its role in affecting risk to autism, the analysis of non-coding variation poses tremendous challenges. The proposed statistical methods and their applications to nearly 20,000 whole genomes from three large autism whole genome sequencing studies will improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in autism with important implications for disease treatment strategies.","Novel Statistical methods for DNA Sequencing Data, and applications to Autism.",9735436,R01MH095797,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain region', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cell type', 'cingulate cortex', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'exome', 'frontal lobe', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'insight', 'large-scale database', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'whole genome']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,454366,0.01493873644998256
"Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms The training included in this career development award promotes the applicant's development as a physician-scientist during his the PhD phase of his MD/PhD training in transdisciplinary computational genomics. The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics. Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause.

"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. The computational tools stemming from this research will enable efficient and accurate inference under complex population genetic models, thereby broadly facilitating research efforts to understand the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk.",Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics,9552183,R01GM094402,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'STEM research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic selection', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'open source', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,297725,0.031102669510395486
"Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods The goal of this research proposal is to develop new in-silico approaches for accurate functional annotation of genetic and post-transcriptional variants. The rapid growth of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and high- throughput -omics data have brought us one step closer towards mechanistic understanding of the complex genetic disease, such as cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes, and others at the molecular level. In particular, these data revealed that complex diseases commonly manifest changes at the genetic and post- transcriptional levels. Bot of these types of changes often affect structure and function of the corresponding genes and their products. Understanding the functional implications of the genetic and post-transcriptional variation is an important task as it can provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Here, we propose to leverage novel machine learning paradigms to design computational methods for predicting the effect of genetic and alternative splicing variants on the macromolecular interactions. Macromolecular interactions underlie many cellular functions in a healthy organism. The disease-induced changes in the genes, such as single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and alternative splicing variations (ASVs) have been recently reported to cause the protein-protein interaction network rewiring. Unfortunately, the experimental high-throughput techniques that characterize the large-scale effects of SNVs or ASVs on PPIs are expensive, time-consuming, and far from being comprehensive. The current in-silico methods either suffer from the limited applicability, or are less accurate when compared with the experimental methods. To overcome these challenges, we will use two recent machine learning paradigms, learning under privileged information (LUPI) and semi-supervised learning. If successful, we expect for the proposed methods to provide the critical advancement in the two main challenges of the current computational approaches, the limited coverage and lower than the experimental accuracy. The methods will be freely available to the community as the stand-alone tools as well as web- servers. The goal of this proposal is to build computational tools that discover the links  between the disease-associated mutations as well as alternatively spliced protein isoforms  and the protein-protein interactions mediated by the disease proteins. The tools use advanced  machine learning methods to find such links in a fast and inexpensive way. These tools  will be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms implicated in the complex genetic disorders.",Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods,9601437,R21LM012772,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Cell physiology', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human Genome', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Organism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'forest', 'gene function', 'gene product', 'genetic variant', 'human interactome', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'protein protein interaction', 'rapid growth', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NLM,WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R21,2018,159669,-0.018424950261241965
"Deep learning methods to predict the function of genetic variants in orofacial clefts Project Summary  Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations (ranging between 1/500 to 1/2500 live births) and represent a major public health challenge. Individuals born with OFCs require surgical, nutritional, dental, speech, medical and behavioral interventions, imposing a substantial economic and personal burden. There has been convincing evidence that non-syndromic OFCs represent human complex disorders with a multifactorial etiology including genetic risk factors, environmental exposures, and their complex interactions. So far, there have been ~10 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted for non-syndromic CL/P (NSCL/P) and >15 genomic loci reported with compelling statistical support, including genes such as IRF6, PAX7, and ABCA4 and the 8q24 locus. In addition, next-generation sequencing (NGS) as well as exome array have been conducted with extra depth of genotyping that enable detection of rare variants associated with OFCs. However, gaps exist in how to interpret these variants and how to identify novel variants from the large volume of data, with high expectations for new methods and new models for “second- analysis” of the genome-wide data. In this proposal, we propose two complementary aims to carry out deep and second-analysis of genome-wide data for OFCs. In Aim 1, we propose a deep learning method to build in silico models that can predict the effect of genetic variants in the context of rich craniofacial epigenomic features. With substantial fine map of sequence patterns, ad hoc motifs will be revealed and variants that disturb these motifs will provide mechanistic insights on OFCs. In Aim 2, we shift our focus to the gene level and propose a network assisted method to discover sensibly combined genes in spatial and temporal points that are critical to orofacial development. We target on all forms of OFCs, with particular interest in NSCL/P. To guarantee the success of this proposal, we form a multi-disciplinary team and local computational infrastructure equipped with GPUs for the implementation of both aims. Our aims are non-overlapping; rather, they are integrated and strongly focused on our fundamental question of interest: how genetic variants function to cause OFCs. The successful completion of our proposal will lead to deep understanding of genetic components in OFCs. Project Narrative Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations and represent a major public health challenge. Substantial progress has been made to identify genes and variants for OFCs through recent genome-wide association studies and next- generation sequencing projects.

"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efﬁciently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be inﬁnitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic refer- ence population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, ﬂies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions consid- ered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and ﬁnd variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and ex- pansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered in- clude: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only ﬁll signiﬁcant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientiﬁc output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9485688,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2018,336445,0.026775409123339637
"Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks The goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods that will identify genes driving epistasis between quantitative trait loci. Genetic association studies in both humans and model organisms have been increasingly able to detect interactions among genetic variants that influence disease risk and pathogenesis. However, identifying which genes are represented by individual variants is a major challenge. Many variants influencing disease are situated between genes, and even those that are in genes may be representing an effect from a neighboring gene. In model organism studies the situation is even more problematic. In breeding experiments, genetic associations with phenotypes typically encompass large regions of DNA with many genes, and experimental follow-up to identify the genes responsible for the association is resource-intensive. To address this problem, we are developing computational tools to prioritize putative gene interactions in interacting genomic regions for biological follow-up. We use machine learning classifiers trained on functional gene-gene interaction networks and combinatorial optimization to identify likely candidate gene-gene interactions responsible for epistatic interactions between genomic regions. Our methods sift through enormous spaces of candidate interactions, retaining only those whose functional interactions identify as plausible for supporting the epistatic interaction. These tools hold promise to dramatically limit the resource-intensity of biological follow up of putative epistasis and to clarify the genetic architecture of complex disease. Genetic studies in humans and model organisms are critical to understanding how genes interact to influence disease. Standard association studies, however, do not identify individual genes, but rather large genetic regions containing many genes, and determining individual genes responsible for phenotypic effects requires resource-intensive biological follow-up experiments. We are developing computational methods to prioritize genes in these regions for biological follow-up, with the ultimate goal of speeding the discovery of novel roles of genes in disease.",Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks,9528022,R21LM012615,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Breeding', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lower Organism', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2018,200175,0.019888487322561165
"Discovery of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric cancers using genomics. Project Summary/Abstract Genomic alterations drive cancer development in pediatric and adult patients, but pediatric cancers display a relative scarcity of somatic variants. This observation coupled with the earlier age of onset in familial cancer syndromes suggests that germline variants contribute to the development of many pediatric cancers. Many known pathogenic germline variants exhibit biological features such as loss of heterozygosity and rarity within the general population; certain germline cancer-causing variants also cause cancer when acquired somatically. Identifying pathogenic germline variants from whole exome sequence (WES) data would clarify the pathogenesis of pediatric cancers, and might support improved treatments for cancer subtypes with poor prognosis such as relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), high-grade glioma (glioma), and ependymoma. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the role of germline variants in pediatric cancer development using genomic data. The objective of this application is to develop a computational biology tool that identifies pathogenic germline variants from WES data, and to apply this tool to analyze germline variants in relapse ALL, glioma, and ependymoma. This application's central hypothesis is that pathogenic germline variants have biological and cohort-specific features that distinguish them from benign variants, such that a machine learning pipeline trained on these features can predict pathogenic germline variants. Aim 1 will call germline variants in WES data from 1) pediatric patients with known cancer-causing germline variants and 2) control patients without cancer; patients in data set 1) are randomly divided into a training and test set. A bioinformatics pipeline will call variants, add annotation, and filter out low quality variants. Aim 2 will use the training set to train and optimize a machine-learning algorithm to predict high confidence germline driver variants. Aim 3 will apply the final pipeline to validation sets of pediatric relapsed ALL, glioma, and ependymoma samples. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that predicts pathogenicity of germline variants using a pediatric cancer cohort, enabling improved understanding of the contribution of germline variants to multiple pediatric cancers. Project Narrative Improved understanding how certain germline DNA variants (those DNA changes that are inherited or occur early in development) promote cancer might lead to better treatments for pediatric cancers. However, identifying which germline variants cause cancer is challenging without genetic information from family members. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational tool that learns from germline variants known to cause cancer and then predicts cancer-causing variants from pediatric cancer patient DNA sequences in the absence of family information; these predicted variants will undergo computational and experimental testing, and may clarify how pediatric cancers like relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, glioma, and ependymoma develop.",Discovery of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric cancers using genomics.,9547342,F31CA210607,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Childhood Cancer Treatment', 'Computational Biology', 'Control Groups', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ependymoma', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family member', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm', 'Inherited', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'functional loss', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2018,36532,0.041117688303201824
"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators.

"UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. These tools help clarify the genetic cause of mental diseases, characterize individual disease risks and develop individualized treatment strategies.",UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS,9645863,R01MH108728,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Reporting', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2018,430000,0.06651808298242874
"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9478321,R01HL134015,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Automobiles', 'Biological Models', 'Bladder', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'First Degree Relative', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial tissue', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genotyped patients', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'rare variant', 'secondary analysis', 'soft tissue', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,692794,-0.017549258345333732
"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced. We will validate our findings with a replication analysis in which we use an independent cohort dataset to quantify the association of the tested variants with the original GWAS phenotype. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis in the coronary or cerebrovascular circulation is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. Numerous DNA variations have been associated with these disorders, but the causal genes are unknown. This research will test whether genes near these DNA variations - and candidate variations themselves - alter platelet function or number to understand better the molecular mechanisms causing heart attacks and strokes.",An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke,9528639,R01HL128234,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Platelets', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Coronary Circulation', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Integrins', 'Intergenic Sequence', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human subject', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'mortality', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small hairpin RNA', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'working group']",NHLBI,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,392470,0.06666118933268933
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,9666548,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2018,190941,0.050193593990260084
"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients. Here we will identify new genes that cause these disorders and evaluate mutations in silico, in a cellular assay, and in whole animals to better predict the disease course in each patient. Treatment options associated with the type of individual patient mutations will also be explored, bringing individualized medicine to these diseases.",ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations,9522439,R01DK058816,"['Age', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Budgets', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cyst', 'Cystic kidney', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Other Genetics', 'PRKCSH protein', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proprotein Convertase 1', 'Proprotein Convertase 2', 'Proteins', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'base', 'disease phenotype', 'dosage', 'early onset', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'polycystic liver disease', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'protein folding', 'screening', 'therapy development', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,510292,0.03800122608688553
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population. Such variants offer great potential for understanding the functional impact of risk alleles and improving mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and related disorders.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families,9555069,R01MH114593,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ireland', 'LGALS3BP gene', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'offspring', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'working group']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,457798,0.04674906607855183
"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases.

"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9405576,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'population stratification', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,297619,0.06619745084806235
"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9483341,U01HG009086,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Government', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'cost', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sciences', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,864186,0.010138887094542224
"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases.

"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9568024,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2018,4132864,0.026417542731804796
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving methods for the 'early' detection of keratoconus will help patients avoid complications of LASIK surgery, allow us to identify genetic variants that contribute to its development, and design therapies to retard its progression.",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,9467545,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Family member', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Videokeratographies', 'Vision', 'base', 'bead chip', 'cardiovascular health', 'cholesterol control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'therapy design', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,759253,0.03355952289554403
"Cardiac genetic effects across HLBS phenotypes Forward genetic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully mapped thousands of loci regulating disorders of the heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS), implicating widespread sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, their functions, mechanisms of action and how they impact disease is still unclear. To solve this new and important GWAS bottleneck, we use a functional genomics-inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the `transcriptional machinery' (transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), target genes) controlling HLBS-relevant tissue functions and how DNA variants in them affect HLBS diseases. Taking advantage of our long-standing expertise and successes in complex, cardiovascular disorders, and novel computational methods we have recently developed, we propose novel genomics analyses of the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program phenotypes and their whole genome sequences, together with publicly available epigenomics data, to identify the molecular bases of HLBS disease. We will first focus on the transcriptional machinery controlling heart physiology and its disorders before exploring other HLBS-relevant tissues and disorders in collaboration with other TOPMed investigators. Our specific aims are: (1) Identifying the transcriptional machinery in the heart and other HLBS relevant tissues; and, (2) Connecting genomic variation in the transcriptional machinery to HLBS traits. Our approach will enable identification of the core molecular components that control HLBS tissues and how they are compromised in HLBS disorders. The major hypothesis explaining the results of heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific HLBS genes and, thereby, modulate variation in the phenotype and disorders. In this proposal, we advance new computational approaches to identify the `transcriptional machinery' (TF, CRE, target genes) controlling HLBS-relevant tissue functions so that the effects of causal genetic variation can be identified within identified trait loci genome- wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding HLBS trait and disease variation, a major public health challenge.",Cardiac genetic effects across HLBS phenotypes,9521873,R01HL141980,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Blood', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'reverse genetics', 'success', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,438051,0.025597486635955197
"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion. Estimates based on common variants and between- species substitutions are confounded by natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion (BGC). Methods relying on incidence rates of monogenic diseases or finding de novo variants by trio sequencing can inform global trends, but do not provide sufficient data to assess fine-scale local parameters. This study will overcome these limitations by using the extremely rare variants (ERVs) as a new data source to characterize patterns of recent germline variation in humans. ERVs, defined in this study as singletons in 30,000 samples, are becoming available via large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of population samples. Unlike common variants or substitutions, ERVs arose very recently and are largely unaffected by selection, BGC, etc. We will analyze 200-300 million singleton variants observed in 30,000 subjects at 20-30X coverage. The regional distribution of ERV subtypes will establish a quantitative atlas of the rate and spectrum of human germline mutations mostly unaltered by selection. We will share this resource with the research community and apply it to determine the impact of local genomic features and epigenomic attributes. We will use the systematic departures between ERVs and variants of higher frequencies (polymorphisms and substitutions) to infer local effects of selection, and this may uncover hitherto unknown functional regions of the genome. By comparing mutation signatures in ERVs with those in somatic variations observed in diverse cancers we will attribute distinct mutational signatures to known biochemical processes and thus infer the major contributors to new germline mutations in the human genome. This subtype-specific atlas will also be used to predict the probability of observing every possible single-base mutation in the genome, thus facilitating the interpretation of candidate causal variants of human diseases. We will assess mutation pattern differences among European Americans, African Americans and Latinos, and seek to discover genetic modifiers of germline mutation rate by finding functionally damaging mutations that show increased ERV counts in the surrounding genomic region, potentially identifying both known and previous unknown ""mutator"" genes that play a role in transmission fidelity in humans. This research will provide an essential resource to study the genesis and maintenance of germline mutations in humans. Understanding such a fundamental process will be the basis for a deeper understanding of human evolution and diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will study the patterns of inherited mutations in humans using approximately 250 million extremely rare DNA variants in human populations. Our results will allow the prediction of the rate of new mutations at every site in the genome based on features of the surrounding DNA sequence, thus providing a common resource to study the arrival and maintenance of mutations in humans. Understanding such a basic process is important for answering fundamental questions in human evolution, the cause of inherited diseases, and the role of DNA abnormality in cancer and aging.",High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms,9494629,R01GM118928,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'European', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'data sharing', 'density', 'driving force', 'epigenomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'next generation sequencing', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'repository', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,300473,0.026730130702277463
"Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat  Genomes DESCRIPTION: The goal of this BD2K K01 application is to provide Dr. Jeremy W. Prokop with the mentoring and training to be an independent investigator in big data to knowledge. Mentoring and training will be provided to Dr. Prokop in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and statistics to advance his skill to allow for independence. This will allow for further develop of his sequence-to-structure-to-function analysis for interpretation of protein coding genetic variants into a usable workflow available to other scientists. The mentoring throughout this award will be from Dr. Howard Jacob, a leader in rat/human genetics and tool development to understand variants in whole genomes. Additionally, Dr. Andrew Greene serves as a co-mentor to help advance skills in proteomics and Dr. Christina Kendziorski as a co-mentor to advance statistical tools/approaches. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a leader in the use of whole genome sequencing in understanding human health, with a Cap/CLIA certified clinical sequencing facility, tools for identifying genetic variants from whole genomes (such as Carpe Novo), and operation of databases like the Rat Genome Database. These tools and knowledge at MCW will serve as an asset for the training and completion of the Aims in this award. Dr. Prokop's research focus in this grant is to further expand the sequence-to-structure-to-function approaches he developed during his Ph.D. and initial postdoc into a workflow and web submission server for other users. Aim 1 of the grant organizes these steps into a workflow allowing for the development of the web based submission server. To test the workflow, 75 candidate genes for cardiovascular disease will be screened. Initial use of the approach has revealed hypotheses for how genetic variants in Havcr1 and Shroom3 result in altered cardiovascular drug response or disease. Variants in these two proteins will be biochemically characterized using a novel decision tree to standardize experiments (Aim 2) and to serve as a quality control for the approaches of Aim 1. From the results of the 75 screened cardiovascular genes, the four genes with the highest confidence score will be validated using the biochemical decision tree in year four and five of this award serving as an additional quality control for the approaches in Aim 1. This grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Prokop to be integrated into the Medical College of Wisconsin's Clinical Sequencing program, allowing for additional R01 proposals for validation of genetic causes of disease, and facilitate the development of Dr. Prokop into an independent researcher in the use of big data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a new tool package that is able to interpret genetic variants of disease genomes into a testable hypothesis of how protein function is perturbed. This tool will allow for improved diagnostic and treatment methods for many human diseases that employ whole genome/exome sequencing such as cardiovascular, cancer, and rare diseases.",Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat  Genomes,9521380,K01ES025435,"['Actins', 'Affinity', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'CLIA certified', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lisinopril', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Precipitation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SFN gene', 'Science of genetics', 'Scientist', 'Serine', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'clinical sequencing', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data to knowledge', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mutant', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'rat genome', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,97903,0.017667081273226203
"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. No changes from original submission Contact PD/PI: Chakravarti, Aravinda The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss.

"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis,9448210,R01AR070139,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Differentiation and Growth', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Haplotypes', 'High Prevalence', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'cartilage cell', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'spatiotemporal', 'whole genome']",NIAMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,699831,0.04684794729558352
"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.",IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset,9567544,U01DK062431,"['ATAC-seq', 'Admixture', 'African', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asians', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Charge', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancers', 'Epithelium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Human Characteristics', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive measure', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macrophage', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'racial disparity', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'study population', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'two-dimensional', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,U01,2018,477338,0.043385787597536085
"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9536132,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'insight', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phenomenological models', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2018,3291017,0.00024931659944876653
"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. The computational tools stemming from this research will enable efficient and accurate inference under complex population genetic models, thereby broadly facilitating research efforts to understand the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk.",Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics,9328097,R01GM094402,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'STEM research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic selection', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'open source', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,298655,0.031102669510395486
"Inferring the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants identified in clinical whole- genome and whole-exome sequencing studies through the development of computational methods to predict functional effects of individual variants. Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of individuals; however, interpreting the clinical significance of the hundreds of thousands of genetic variants identified in these studies remains a critical challenge. Gene expression regulation is one mechanism by which variants can result in disease or other clinically-significant phenotypes. This mechanism is likely to be particularly important for disease-causing variants that do not directly affect protein structure by altering an amino acid sequence. The methods developed here will enable researchers to predict whether genetic variants are likely to have a regulatory effect on gene expression. The first stage of the project is to build computational models to predict such regulatory effects using a random forest machine learning approach. These models will be trained to recognize regulatory variation using a set of variants that have been shown to be involved in expression regulation in a recent study of gene expression across hundreds of individuals. Separate algorithms will be developed to predict two different types of regulatory effects: changes in the total amount of RNA produced from a particular gene (expression level variation) and changes in the specific form of RNA produced from a particular gene (splicing or isoform ratio variation). The second stage of the project is to evaluate the performance of these models on gene expression datasets from a separate human population and from different tissues within the human body, to explore their generalizability and to determine to what extent the characteristics of regulatory variants are conserved across tissues and populations. The final stage of the project is to use genetic variants in publicly-available databases that are known to be pathogenic to characterize how well these models perform at predicting clinical significance. This stage will test the hypothesis that variants that regulate gene expression are more likely to be clinically significant than variants that do not regulate expression. This project will impact public health by providing useful tools to improve prediction of the clinical significance of genetic variants identified in genome- scale sequencing studies. In addition, the project will provide biological insight into the tissue-specificity and population-specificity of genomic features that characterize regulatory genetic variants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of patients and other individuals. However, interpreting the clinical significance of the hundreds of thousands of genetic variants identified in these studies remains a critical challenge.

"Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All genetic variation is created by mutations, changes that arise due to DNA damage or copying mistakes during DNA replication. Mutations are frequent enough that, on average, a child's 3-billion base pair genome contains 74 new genetic variants that are not present in the genome of either parent. Such new mutations confer a higher disease risk than older mutations because they have not passed the test of surviving through several generations of parents and offspring. We aim to pinpoint how the human mutation rate has evolved as humans left Africa and adapted to diverse new environments across the globe.  One specific aim will follow up on my preliminary research which showed that Europeans experienced a mutation rate change after diverging from Africans and Asians. The primary evidence for this change is that European genomes have a higher burden than African or Asian genomes of the mutation type TCC→TTC, where the trinucleotide ""TCC"" has experienced a mutation from ""C"" to ""T"" at its central site. We wish to and the genetic basis of this mutation rate change by looking at rare variants in mixed- ancestry Latino and African-American individuals. Specially, we will isolate young genetic variants that probably arose via mutation within the past 10-15 generations, after gene ow from Europe into the Americas had already begun. We will infer the genetic background (European, African, or Native American) upon which each new mutation arose and look for genomic regions where European ances- try correlates strongly with an excess of TCC→TTC mutations. These will be the regions most likely to harbor a causal allele that changed the process of mutation accumulation in Europeans. This work has the potential to yield valuable insights into melanoma, a cancer that predominantly affects individuals of European ancestry and whose somatic mutational signature is dominated by TCC→TTC.  A second specific aim is to look for other signatures of mutation rate change that have occurred within the human species or, more broadly, within the great apes. We will use a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify collections of mutation types whose rates appear to be under common genetic control. A few mutation types besides TCC→TTC show weak signals of rate differentiation between populations, and we will attempt to infer how many separate mutation rate change events are necessary to explain these signals. The admixture mapping technique from Specific Aim I can also be adapted to interrogate the genetic basis of other mutation rate changes that might have occurred in the recent past. These efforts should improve our understanding of the human mutation rate's genetic architecture and how mutation rates differ between populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All genetic variation is created by mutations, the copying mistakes that occasionally happen during DNA replication. There is evidence that children born with a higher burden of new mutations are at increased risk for autism, schizophrenia, and serious congenital diseases [1, 2, 3], but it is not well understood how much the human mutation rate varies and what genetic risk factors affect the mutation rate [4].

"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing. The impact of genetic variation on splicing is not well understood. The goal of this research project i to computationally identify features of variants useful in predicting aberrant splicing, then incorporate the features into a machine learning algorithm and test the utility of the predictions using publically available sequencing studies. 1            ",Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing,9213314,F31HG007804,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Inherited', 'Introns', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,17892,0.02759783607627793
"Discovery of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric cancers using genomics. Project Summary/Abstract Genomic alterations drive cancer development in pediatric and adult patients, but pediatric cancers display a relative scarcity of somatic variants. This observation coupled with the earlier age of onset in familial cancer syndromes suggests that germline variants contribute to the development of many pediatric cancers. Many known pathogenic germline variants exhibit biological features such as loss of heterozygosity and rarity within the general population; certain germline cancer-causing variants also cause cancer when acquired somatically. Identifying pathogenic germline variants from whole exome sequence (WES) data would clarify the pathogenesis of pediatric cancers, and might support improved treatments for cancer subtypes with poor prognosis such as relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), high-grade glioma (glioma), and ependymoma. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the role of germline variants in pediatric cancer development using genomic data. The objective of this application is to develop a computational biology tool that identifies pathogenic germline variants from WES data, and to apply this tool to analyze germline variants in relapse ALL, glioma, and ependymoma. This application's central hypothesis is that pathogenic germline variants have biological and cohort-specific features that distinguish them from benign variants, such that a machine learning pipeline trained on these features can predict pathogenic germline variants. Aim 1 will call germline variants in WES data from 1) pediatric patients with known cancer-causing germline variants and 2) control patients without cancer; patients in data set 1) are randomly divided into a training and test set. A bioinformatics pipeline will call variants, add annotation, and filter out low quality variants. Aim 2 will use the training set to train and optimize a machine-learning algorithm to predict high confidence germline driver variants. Aim 3 will apply the final pipeline to validation sets of pediatric relapsed ALL, glioma, and ependymoma samples. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that predicts pathogenicity of germline variants using a pediatric cancer cohort, enabling improved understanding of the contribution of germline variants to multiple pediatric cancers. Project Narrative Improved understanding how certain germline DNA variants (those DNA changes that are inherited or occur early in development) promote cancer might lead to better treatments for pediatric cancers. However, identifying which germline variants cause cancer is challenging without genetic information from family members. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational tool that learns from germline variants known to cause cancer and then predicts cancer-causing variants from pediatric cancer patient DNA sequences in the absence of family information; these predicted variants will undergo computational and experimental testing, and may clarify how pediatric cancers like relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, glioma, and ependymoma develop.",Discovery of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric cancers using genomics.,9313620,F31CA210607,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Childhood Cancer Treatment', 'Computational Biology', 'Control Groups', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ependymoma', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family member', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm', 'Inherited', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'functional loss', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2017,40106,0.041117688303201824
"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators.

"UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. These tools help clarify the genetic cause of mental diseases, characterize individual disease risks and develop individualized treatment strategies.            ",UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS,9389287,R01MH108728,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Reporting', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,381539,0.06651808298242874
"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,9313321,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Privatization', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'heart rhythm', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'standard of care', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,1280593,0.1150374168342617
"An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity. Comprehensive identification and analysis of these genetic variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health and demography. Despite recent advances, the tools and data needed to comprehensively identify all types of SVs, genotype each variant, integrate and phase these variants remain lacking. Indeed, the data released from the early phases of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are biased primarily towards the detection of deletions within relatively unique regions of the genome.

"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9331729,R01HL134015,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Automobiles', 'Biological Models', 'Bladder', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'First Degree Relative', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'craniofacial', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genotyped patients', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'rare variant', 'secondary analysis', 'soft tissue', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,650526,-0.017549258345333732
"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced.

"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study? (3) How to accurately capture possible interactions between multiple genetic factors and their joint contribution to phenotypic variation? In particular, we will develop data structures and efficient algorithms for accurate and robust significance assessment that account for local population structure and joint effect of multiple genetic factors.    The proposed computational tools will be integrated into software packages under common application framework adopted by the broad scientific community.

"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population. Such variants offer great potential for understanding the functional impact of risk alleles and improving mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and related disorders.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families,9403711,R01MH114593,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economic Inflation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ireland', 'LGALS3BP gene', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'offspring', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'working group']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,464747,0.04674906607855183
"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4).

"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9275537,U01HG009086,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Government', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'cost', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,864186,0.010138887094542224
"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data.

"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases.

"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9207474,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'population stratification', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,297842,0.06619745084806235
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9479556,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2017,4412707,0.026417542731804796
"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion. Estimates based on common variants and between- species substitutions are confounded by natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion (BGC). Methods relying on incidence rates of monogenic diseases or finding de novo variants by trio sequencing can inform global trends, but do not provide sufficient data to assess fine-scale local parameters. This study will overcome these limitations by using the extremely rare variants (ERVs) as a new data source to characterize patterns of recent germline variation in humans. ERVs, defined in this study as singletons in 30,000 samples, are becoming available via large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of population samples. Unlike common variants or substitutions, ERVs arose very recently and are largely unaffected by selection, BGC, etc. We will analyze 200-300 million singleton variants observed in 30,000 subjects at 20-30X coverage. The regional distribution of ERV subtypes will establish a quantitative atlas of the rate and spectrum of human germline mutations mostly unaltered by selection. We will share this resource with the research community and apply it to determine the impact of local genomic features and epigenomic attributes. We will use the systematic departures between ERVs and variants of higher frequencies (polymorphisms and substitutions) to infer local effects of selection, and this may uncover hitherto unknown functional regions of the genome. By comparing mutation signatures in ERVs with those in somatic variations observed in diverse cancers we will attribute distinct mutational signatures to known biochemical processes and thus infer the major contributors to new germline mutations in the human genome. This subtype-specific atlas will also be used to predict the probability of observing every possible single-base mutation in the genome, thus facilitating the interpretation of candidate causal variants of human diseases. We will assess mutation pattern differences among European Americans, African Americans and Latinos, and seek to discover genetic modifiers of germline mutation rate by finding functionally damaging mutations that show increased ERV counts in the surrounding genomic region, potentially identifying both known and previous unknown ""mutator"" genes that play a role in transmission fidelity in humans. This research will provide an essential resource to study the genesis and maintenance of germline mutations in humans. Understanding such a fundamental process will be the basis for a deeper understanding of human evolution and diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will study the patterns of inherited mutations in humans using approximately 250 million extremely rare DNA variants in human populations. Our results will allow the prediction of the rate of new mutations at every site in the genome based on features of the surrounding DNA sequence, thus providing a common resource to study the arrival and maintenance of mutations in humans. Understanding such a basic process is important for answering fundamental questions in human evolution, the cause of inherited diseases, and the role of DNA abnormality in cancer and aging.",High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms,9275505,R01GM118928,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'European', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'data sharing', 'density', 'driving force', 'epigenomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'next generation sequencing', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'repository', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,300742,0.026730130702277463
"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers. We propose to connect pharmacogenomic variant discovery with novel high-throughput experimental approaches to deliver a resource to guide the use of individual pharmacogenomic information in personalizing drug treatment.",F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes,9302807,R24GM115277,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CYP2C19 gene', 'CYP2C9 gene', 'CYP2D6 gene', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Assay', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Funding', 'Gene Library', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Numerical value', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Source', 'TPMT gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'mutation screening', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stability testing', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R24,2017,737011,0.05720863698169062
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving methods for the 'early' detection of keratoconus will help patients avoid complications of LASIK surgery, allow us to identify genetic variants that contribute to its development, and design therapies to retard its progression.",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,9238774,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Family member', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Videokeratographies', 'Vision', 'base', 'bead chip', 'cardiovascular health', 'cholesterol control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'therapy design', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,770725,0.03355952289554403
"Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our capacity to sequence human genomes has exceeded our ability to interpret genetic variation, particularly in non-coding regions. To address this challenge, we recently developed a novel framework, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), for estimating the deleteriousness of any genetic variant. CADD defines an objective, data-rich, and quantitative integration of many genomic annotations into a single measure of variant effect at the organismal level. The goals of this R01 proposal are to further develop the CADD framework, to apply it in the context of ongoing genetic studies of both rare and common human diseases, and to experimentally evaluate its predictions. In Specific Aim 1, we will substantially modify CADD in both straightforward and creative ways, with the goal of dramatically improving CADD's ability to annotate non- coding variants, not only to estimate their organismal effects but also to provide insights into molecular mechanisms. In Specific Aim 2, we will apply CADD to a variety of ongoing whole genome sequencing studies of human disease, especially those in which non-coding variants are either known or suspected to be causal. As part of this effort, we will develop new statistical frameworks that directly incorporat CADD into traditional genome-wide discovery approaches. In Specific Aim 3, we will perform a combination of high-throughput (massively parallel reporter assays), medium-throughput (CRISPR/Cas9), and low-throughput (in vivo mouse transgenics) experimental assays for systematic and targeted assessment of CADD predictions. This proposal includes both computational and experimental innovations, and builds on established collaborative relationships between investigators with complementary strengths. The completion of our aims will yield novel methods, data, and resources with which to annotate whole genome sequences, broadly enabling the field to more effectively identify and mechanistically understand non-coding genetic variants that are causally relevant to human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As we enter an era of personalized medicine, a deep understanding of human genomes will be increasingly important to public health, contributing to the unraveling of the genetic basis of human disease, as well as serving an increasing role in clinical diagnostics. However, our limited understanding of the functional consequences of most genetic variants, especially those that do not alter protein sequence, represents a major obstacle. This proposal seeks to dramatically improve our ability to identify and interpret ""non-coding"" variants that causally contribute to human disease. A recently developed computational approach will be substantially improved and evaluated in a variety of genetic studies, and its predictions will be experimentally validated. This project will provide much needed methods and resources to address the looming analytical challenges associated with individual whole genome sequencing in both biomedical research and patient care.",Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation,9228346,R01CA197139,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'candidate identification', 'clinical diagnostics', 'data resource', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,632716,0.056260874939747886
"Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes DESCRIPTION: The goal of this BD2K K01 application is to provide Dr. Jeremy W. Prokop with the mentoring and training to be an independent investigator in big data to knowledge. Mentoring and training will be provided to Dr. Prokop in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and statistics to advance his skill to allow for independence. This will allow for further develop of his sequence-to-structure-to-function analysis for interpretation of protein coding genetic variants into a usable workflow available to other scientists. The mentoring throughout this award will be from Dr. Howard Jacob, a leader in rat/human genetics and tool development to understand variants in whole genomes. Additionally, Dr. Andrew Greene serves as a co-mentor to help advance skills in proteomics and Dr. Christina Kendziorski as a co-mentor to advance statistical tools/approaches. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a leader in the use of whole genome sequencing in understanding human health, with a Cap/CLIA certified clinical sequencing facility, tools for identifying genetic variants from whole genomes (such as Carpe Novo), and operation of databases like the Rat Genome Database. These tools and knowledge at MCW will serve as an asset for the training and completion of the Aims in this award. Dr. Prokop's research focus in this grant is to further expand the sequence-to-structure-to-function approaches he developed during his Ph.D. and initial postdoc into a workflow and web submission server for other users. Aim 1 of the grant organizes these steps into a workflow allowing for the development of the web based submission server. To test the workflow, 75 candidate genes for cardiovascular disease will be screened. Initial use of the approach has revealed hypotheses for how genetic variants in Havcr1 and Shroom3 result in altered cardiovascular drug response or disease. Variants in these two proteins will be biochemically characterized using a novel decision tree to standardize experiments (Aim 2) and to serve as a quality control for the approaches of Aim 1. From the results of the 75 screened cardiovascular genes, the four genes with the highest confidence score will be validated using the biochemical decision tree in year four and five of this award serving as an additional quality control for the approaches in Aim 1. This grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Prokop to be integrated into the Medical College of Wisconsin's Clinical Sequencing program, allowing for additional R01 proposals for validation of genetic causes of disease, and facilitate the development of Dr. Prokop into an independent researcher in the use of big data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a new tool package that is able to interpret genetic variants of disease genomes into a testable hypothesis of how protein function is perturbed.

"Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to characterize the molecular and cellular causes of human disease, it will be essential to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation. However, we are currently unable to predict the impact of the majority genetic variants that lie in non-coding regions of the genome, where indeed most complex disease-associated variants are found. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that a significant fraction of the non-coding genome is likely to be functional, often playing a role in gene regulation. Therefore, our limited understanding of non- coding variation is a critical hurdle to characterizing the genetic basis of disease. The goal of this project is to develop methods for interpreting non-coding genetic variation: to provide a robust and extensible Bayesian method for predicting causal variants from full genomes, to identify and validate a large set of functional non- coding variants using CRISPR technology, and to predict disease-relevant traits likely to be affected by each variant. Our project will leverage a unique cohort from a founder population in Sardinia, with genome sequence and/or transcriptome data available from 3000 individuals, along with extensive phenotyping for hundreds of traits. We will combine advanced statistical modeling with experimental validation based on genome engineering to identify causal non-coding variants affecting biomedical traits in the cohort, along with predicting functional mechanisms through which these variants ultimately perturb the cell. In Aim 1, we develop computational methods for predicting causal non-coding variation from full genomes, incorporating informative genomic features including epigenetic data, sequence motifs, and conservation information into a Bayesian approach jointly modeling multiple transcriptomic signals. We will optimize and apply these methods on genome and transcriptome data available for the Sardinia cohort to identify a large set of variants predicted to causally affect gene expression. Based on these predictions, in Aim 2, we connect putative causal variants with the diverse set of disease-relevant traits measured in the cohort, using network inference to capture the cascade from genetic variation to gene expression to disease. We will develop methods to integrate across variants, using the models in Aim 1, to identify the common causal mechanisms related to each trait. In Aim 3, we validate the causal impact of non-coding variants predicted to affect high-level traits. We will us genome editing through CRISPR to introduce individual genetic variants into cell lines and use qPCR to validate the predicted effects on gene expression. Finally, a major goal throughout this proposal will be to provide the research community with convenient computational tools for the prediction of causal non-coding variants from individual genomes, updated on an ongoing basis to integrate the most recent genomic annotations and public data in order to provide the best possible accuracy in predicting causal variants and the traits they are likely to affect. Our projet will greatly advance our understanding of non-coding genetic variation, the specific mechanisms affected by causal variants, and the downstream consequences to the cell and individual health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Understanding the impact of variation in the entire genome, beyond the well-studied protein-coding regions, is essential to understanding the relationship between genetics and human health. This proposal addresses the problem of identifying functional non-coding genetic variants and predicting the impact of each variant on hundreds of disease-relevant traits.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss.

"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of functional trait variants are polymorphic, non-coding and perturb transcription of a specific gene by altering the functions of their cis-regulatory elements. We propose a research paradigm for systematically identifying these non-coding trait variants, the regulatory functions they disrupt and the specific genes whose functions are altered at each quantitative trait locus. We will utilize integrative statisticl genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, using QT interval as a model 'system'. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform high- resolution mapping of GWAS signals to identify all polymorphic (>1%) and rare variants at loci that modulate the QT-interval; (2) to conduct in silico and in vitro analysis to predict and prioritize all cardiac regulatory (enhancer, silencer, insulator) elements and their cognate DNA-binding proteins; and, (3) to identify trait variants, genes and their mechanisms of genetic action. The overall goals are to improve the molecular genetic and mechanistic understanding of multifactorial traits for applications to other complex phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The electrocardiographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, has 68 predominantly non-coding variants at 35 loci explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance upon meta-analyses in >76,000 individuals of European and >11,000 individuals of African ancestry: nevertheless, the molecular details remain unknown. We propose a program of research for systematically identifying the functional non-coding quantitative trait variants, the regulatory function they disrupt and the specific gene whose functions are altered, at each locus. We utilize integrative statistical genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms in this model trait with the overall goal to improve the molecular understanding of all complex phenotypes.",GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES,9321841,R01GM104469,"['Action Potentials', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'African', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Base Sequence', 'Beer', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'EP300 gene', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enhancers', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'GATA4 gene', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome Mappings', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hypersensitivity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insulator Elements', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Muscle Cells', 'Neonatal', 'Nuclear Extract', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Microchips', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Weight', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene function', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'novel', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,186010,0.06735169273661798
"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.",IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset,9402477,U01DK062431,"['ATAC-seq', 'Admixture', 'African', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asians', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Charge', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancers', 'Epithelium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Human Characteristics', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive measure', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'differential expression', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macrophage', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'racial disparity', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'study population', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'two-dimensional', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,U01,2017,505613,0.043385787597536085
"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9320861,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'insight', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phenomenological models', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2017,2548493,0.00024931659944876653
"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. The computational tools stemming from this research will enable efficient and accurate inference under complex population genetic models, thereby broadly facilitating research efforts to understand the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk.",Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics,9145232,R01GM094402,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic selection', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'open source', 'pressure', 'stem', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2016,303092,0.031102669510395486
"Inferring the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants identified in clinical whole- genome and whole-exome sequencing studies through the development of computational methods to predict functional effects of individual variants. Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of individuals; however, interpreting the clinical significance of the hundreds of thousands of genetic variants identified in these studies remains a critical challenge. Gene expression regulation is one mechanism by which variants can result in disease or other clinically-significant phenotypes. This mechanism is likely to be particularly important for disease-causing variants that do not directly affect protein structure by altering an amino acid sequence. The methods developed here will enable researchers to predict whether genetic variants are likely to have a regulatory effect on gene expression. The first stage of the project is to build computational models to predict such regulatory effects using a random forest machine learning approach. These models will be trained to recognize regulatory variation using a set of variants that have been shown to be involved in expression regulation in a recent study of gene expression across hundreds of individuals. Separate algorithms will be developed to predict two different types of regulatory effects: changes in the total amount of RNA produced from a particular gene (expression level variation) and changes in the specific form of RNA produced from a particular gene (splicing or isoform ratio variation). The second stage of the project is to evaluate the performance of these models on gene expression datasets from a separate human population and from different tissues within the human body, to explore their generalizability and to determine to what extent the characteristics of regulatory variants are conserved across tissues and populations. The final stage of the project is to use genetic variants in publicly-available databases that are known to be pathogenic to characterize how well these models perform at predicting clinical significance. This stage will test the hypothesis that variants that regulate gene expression are more likely to be clinically significant than variants that do not regulate expression. This project will impact public health by providing useful tools to improve prediction of the clinical significance of genetic variants identified in genome- scale sequencing studies. In addition, the project will provide biological insight into the tissue-specificity and population-specificity of genomic features that characterize regulatory genetic variants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of patients and other individuals. However, interpreting the clinical significance of the hundreds of thousands of genetic variants identified in these studies remains a critical challenge.

"Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All genetic variation is created by mutations, changes that arise due to DNA damage or copying mistakes during DNA replication. Mutations are frequent enough that, on average, a child's 3-billion base pair genome contains 74 new genetic variants that are not present in the genome of either parent. Such new mutations confer a higher disease risk than older mutations because they have not passed the test of surviving through several generations of parents and offspring. We aim to pinpoint how the human mutation rate has evolved as humans left Africa and adapted to diverse new environments across the globe.  One specific aim will follow up on my preliminary research which showed that Europeans experienced a mutation rate change after diverging from Africans and Asians. The primary evidence for this change is that European genomes have a higher burden than African or Asian genomes of the mutation type TCC→TTC, where the trinucleotide ""TCC"" has experienced a mutation from ""C"" to ""T"" at its central site. We wish to and the genetic basis of this mutation rate change by looking at rare variants in mixed- ancestry Latino and African-American individuals. Specially, we will isolate young genetic variants that probably arose via mutation within the past 10-15 generations, after gene ow from Europe into the Americas had already begun. We will infer the genetic background (European, African, or Native American) upon which each new mutation arose and look for genomic regions where European ances- try correlates strongly with an excess of TCC→TTC mutations. These will be the regions most likely to harbor a causal allele that changed the process of mutation accumulation in Europeans. This work has the potential to yield valuable insights into melanoma, a cancer that predominantly affects individuals of European ancestry and whose somatic mutational signature is dominated by TCC→TTC.  A second specific aim is to look for other signatures of mutation rate change that have occurred within the human species or, more broadly, within the great apes. We will use a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify collections of mutation types whose rates appear to be under common genetic control. A few mutation types besides TCC→TTC show weak signals of rate differentiation between populations, and we will attempt to infer how many separate mutation rate change events are necessary to explain these signals. The admixture mapping technique from Specific Aim I can also be adapted to interrogate the genetic basis of other mutation rate changes that might have occurred in the recent past. These efforts should improve our understanding of the human mutation rate's genetic architecture and how mutation rates differ between populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All genetic variation is created by mutations, the copying mistakes that occasionally happen during DNA replication. There is evidence that children born with a higher burden of new mutations are at increased risk for autism, schizophrenia, and serious congenital diseases [1, 2, 3], but it is not well understood how much the human mutation rate varies and what genetic risk factors affect the mutation rate [4]. We aim to follow up on preliminary evidence that the Europeans have a higher mutation rate than Asians or Africans [5], looking for the genetic basis of this rate difference and investigating how often the mutation rate has changed during human evolution.",Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate,9117987,F32GM116381,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Americas', 'Architecture', 'Asians', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base Pairing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Cancer Biology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Europe', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Latino', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parents', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'admixture mapping', 'base', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'melanoma', 'offspring', 'rare variant', 'rate of change', 'success', 'trait', 'transition mutation']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2016,56118,0.04168032501575783
"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing. The impact of genetic variation on splicing is not well understood. The goal of this research project i to computationally identify features of variants useful in predicting aberrant splicing, then incorporate the features into a machine learning algorithm and test the utility of the predictions using publically available sequencing studies. 1            ",Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing,8991662,F31HG007804,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Inherited', 'Introns', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,0.02759783607627793
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs).

This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2.

"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs).

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants. Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.",Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation,9039648,R01HG006264,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Housing', 'Human Genetics', 'Intervention', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Splicing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,308000,0.0729124336809166
"Discovery of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric cancers using genomics. Project Summary/Abstract Genomic alterations drive cancer development in pediatric and adult patients, but pediatric cancers display a relative scarcity of somatic variants. This observation coupled with the earlier age of onset in familial cancer syndromes suggests that germline variants contribute to the development of many pediatric cancers. Many known pathogenic germline variants exhibit biological features such as loss of heterozygosity and rarity within the general population; certain germline cancer-causing variants also cause cancer when acquired somatically. Identifying pathogenic germline variants from whole exome sequence (WES) data would clarify the pathogenesis of pediatric cancers, and might support improved treatments for cancer subtypes with poor prognosis such as relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), high-grade glioma (glioma), and ependymoma. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the role of germline variants in pediatric cancer development using genomic data. The objective of this application is to develop a computational biology tool that identifies pathogenic germline variants from WES data, and to apply this tool to analyze germline variants in relapse ALL, glioma, and ependymoma. This application's central hypothesis is that pathogenic germline variants have biological and cohort-specific features that distinguish them from benign variants, such that a machine learning pipeline trained on these features can predict pathogenic germline variants. Aim 1 will call germline variants in WES data from 1) pediatric patients with known cancer-causing germline variants and 2) control patients without cancer; patients in data set 1) are randomly divided into a training and test set. A bioinformatics pipeline will call variants, add annotation, and filter out low quality variants. Aim 2 will use the training set to train and optimize a machine-learning algorithm to predict high confidence germline driver variants. Aim 3 will apply the final pipeline to validation sets of pediatric relapsed ALL, glioma, and ependymoma samples. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that predicts pathogenicity of germline variants using a pediatric cancer cohort, enabling improved understanding of the contribution of germline variants to multiple pediatric cancers. Project Narrative Improved understanding how certain germline DNA variants (those DNA changes that are inherited or occur early in development) promote cancer might lead to better treatments for pediatric cancers. However, identifying which germline variants cause cancer is challenging without genetic information from family members. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational tool that learns from germline variants known to cause cancer and then predicts cancer-causing variants from pediatric cancer patient DNA sequences in the absence of family information; these predicted variants will undergo computational and experimental testing, and may clarify how pediatric cancers like relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, glioma, and ependymoma develop.",Discovery of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric cancers using genomics.,9195404,F31CA210607,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Childhood Cancer Treatment', 'Computational Biology', 'Control Groups', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ependymoma', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family member', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm', 'Inherited', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cancer subtypes', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'functional loss', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2016,39638,0.041117688303201824
"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease. The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.",Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations,9126587,R01GM104125,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Inbreeding', 'Influentials', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'genetic resource', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'prospective', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,241086,0.03319328498476981
"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of our project is to accelerate the discovery of DNA variation relevant to health and disease by analyzing data from over 225,000 ethnically and racially diverse patients that will undergo genome sequencing.

"Understanding the functional impacts of genetic variants in mental disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. These tools help clarify the genetic cause of mental diseases, characterize individual disease risks and develop individualized treatment strategies.            ",Understanding the functional impacts of genetic variants in mental disorders,9009397,R01MH108728,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Reporting', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'novel', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,396250,0.06651808298242874
"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,9111957,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart rhythm', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'standard of care', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,1277210,0.1150374168342617
"An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity. Comprehensive identification and analysis of these genetic variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health and demography. Despite recent advances, the tools and data needed to comprehensively identify all types of SVs, genotype each variant, integrate and phase these variants remain lacking. Indeed, the data released from the early phases of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are biased primarily towards the detection of deletions within relatively unique regions of the genome. As a consortium, we propose to pool expertise from various research groups to provide an integrative analysis of SVs by combining rigorous computational algorithmic development with extensive experimental validation. The new algorithms we develop and the high confidence lists of SVs obtained will be rapidly made available as a public resource. n/a",An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project,9208745,U41HG007497,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleotides', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'deletion detection', 'design', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'integration site', 'method development', 'novel', 'research study', 'tool']",NHGRI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U41,2016,2868077,0.0538128739144684
"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9177170,R01HL134015,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Automobiles', 'Biological Models', 'Bladder', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'First Degree Relative', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'craniofacial', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genotyped patients', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'rare variant', 'soft tissue', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,740775,-0.017549258345333732
"Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to decipher the genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with the chromatin modification information in human immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that IBD results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to intestinal microbes in a genetically susceptible host. Among complex diseases, GWAS methods have been successful in IBD, identifying hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci. However, the majority of these disease-associated DNA variants fall into the gene-desert part of the genome, complicating their functional evaluation. There is now overwhelming evidence that the noncoding disease-associated DNA variants disrupt the action of key regulatory elements in relevant cell types. Since genomic coordinates of active regulatory elements can be charted using unique chromatin features, genome-wide profiling of chromatin modifications in relevant cell types can be used to pinpoint to DNA variants disrupting active regulatory elements.  Two recent studies discovered a novel kind of enhancers that occurs within exceptionally large genomic domains. These regions were initially dubbed as 'super-enhancers'. Super-enhancer domains occur at key identity genes in a variety of cell types. Strikingly, these enhancer domains are more sensitive to perturbation such as loss of transcription factors than typical shorter enhancers.  Because of the fragility of super-enhancers to perturbation, I postulate that super-enhancer domains of relevant immune cells harbor IBD-associated DNA variants. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 of this proposal, I will characterize super-enhancer structures of the human immune system. I will first develop an unsupervised machine learning technique to chart super-enhancer structures from histone acetylation (H3K27Ac) data in diverse immune cells. Using this technique, I will next delineate cell type- specific enhancer domains in the immune cells and investigate the relationship among cells types with respect to their super-enhancer structures. In Aim 2 of this proposal, I will investigate the enrichment of IBD-associated DNA variants within the super-enhancers of the most relevant immune cells. I then link these variants to genes and pathways that they regulate and are affected in disease utilizing gene expression and long-range chromatin interaction datasets. Completion of these aims, along with training opportunities associated with this proposal will establish the necessary foundation for my career as an independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people in North America and Europe. GWAS methods have identified hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci in IBD. Yet, the functional effects of mos IBD-implicated variants remain largely unexplained. The finding that nearly 90% of these sites occur outside of protein-coding sequences suggests that many associated variants may instead have a role in gene regulation. Cell context is a key determinant of gene regulation but where IBD genetic variants are functional is largely unknown. This proposal seeks to utilize the chromatin structure of human immune cells to discover the cell context for IBD-associated variants. The identification of the pathogenic cell types as well as the molecular pathways that contribute to the disease will contribute greatly to our ability to treat patients.",Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),9068802,K22AI112570,"['Address', 'Affect', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Enhancers', 'Epithelial', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intestines', 'Junk DNA', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'NCAM1 gene', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Immunity', 'North America', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'cohort', 'commensal microbes', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'training opportunity', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K22,2016,105224,0.028123562171918633
"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced. We will validate our findings with a replication analysis in which we use an independent cohort dataset to quantify the association of the tested variants with the original GWAS phenotype. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis in the coronary or cerebrovascular circulation is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. Numerous DNA variations have been associated with these disorders, but the causal genes are unknown. This research will test whether genes near these DNA variations - and candidate variations themselves - alter platelet function or number to understand better the molecular mechanisms causing heart attacks and strokes.",An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke,9115225,R01HL128234,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Platelet Disorders', 'Blood Platelets', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'ChIP-seq', 'Coronary Circulation', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Integrins', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Sentinel', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human subject', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'mortality', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'screening', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'working group']",NHLBI,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,392349,0.06666118933268933
"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.",Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences,9118280,R01HG007068,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'direct application', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'rare variant', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,380625,0.07171701089323362
"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases.

"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.            ","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9132585,U01HG009086,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'cost', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,854333,0.010138887094542224
"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases. This goal is directly relevant to the missions of NIH to improve the capability of disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.            ",Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants,9071997,R01CA213466,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Mediated Cytolysis', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical Research', 'Clofarabine', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Exons', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Introns', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Spliced Genes', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cytotoxic', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'mRNA Precursor', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oncology', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'structural genomics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2016,576262,0.07702657564784586
"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.                ",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9055844,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,309883,0.06619745084806235
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the ‘early’ detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to its development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to finemap already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this twostage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 “convenience controls” f rom the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the ‘early’ subclinical phenotypes identified through the use of VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease. Improving methods for the ‘early’ detection of keratoconus will help patients avoid complications of LASIK surgery, allow us to identify genetic variants that contribute to its development, and design therapies to retard its progression.",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,9353966,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cholesterol', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Family member', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Videokeratographies', 'Vision', 'base', 'bead chip', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'therapy design/development', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,100384,0.03257240877462824
"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers. We propose to connect pharmacogenomic variant discovery with novel high-throughput experimental approaches to deliver a resource to guide the use of individual pharmacogenomic information in personalizing drug treatment.",F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes,9110269,R24GM115277,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CYP2C19 gene', 'CYP2C9 gene', 'CYP2D6 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Assay', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Numerical value', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Source', 'TPMT gene', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'computerized data processing', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'stability testing', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R24,2016,747826,0.05720863698169062
"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data.

"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion. Estimates based on common variants and between- species substitutions are confounded by natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion (BGC). Methods relying on incidence rates of monogenic diseases or finding de novo variants by trio sequencing can inform global trends, but do not provide sufficient data to assess fine-scale local parameters. This study will overcome these limitations by using the extremely rare variants (ERVs) as a new data source to characterize patterns of recent germline variation in humans. ERVs, defined in this study as singletons in 30,000 samples, are becoming available via large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of population samples. Unlike common variants or substitutions, ERVs arose very recently and are largely unaffected by selection, BGC, etc. We will analyze 200-300 million singleton variants observed in 30,000 subjects at 20-30X coverage. The regional distribution of ERV subtypes will establish a quantitative atlas of the rate and spectrum of human germline mutations mostly unaltered by selection. We will share this resource with the research community and apply it to determine the impact of local genomic features and epigenomic attributes. We will use the systematic departures between ERVs and variants of higher frequencies (polymorphisms and substitutions) to infer local effects of selection, and this may uncover hitherto unknown functional regions of the genome. By comparing mutation signatures in ERVs with those in somatic variations observed in diverse cancers we will attribute distinct mutational signatures to known biochemical processes and thus infer the major contributors to new germline mutations in the human genome. This subtype-specific atlas will also be used to predict the probability of observing every possible single-base mutation in the genome, thus facilitating the interpretation of candidate causal variants of human diseases. We will assess mutation pattern differences among European Americans, African Americans and Latinos, and seek to discover genetic modifiers of germline mutation rate by finding functionally damaging mutations that show increased ERV counts in the surrounding genomic region, potentially identifying both known and previous unknown ""mutator"" genes that play a role in transmission fidelity in humans. This research will provide an essential resource to study the genesis and maintenance of germline mutations in humans. Understanding such a fundamental process will be the basis for a deeper understanding of human evolution and diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will study the patterns of inherited mutations in humans using approximately 250 million extremely rare DNA variants in human populations. Our results will allow the prediction of the rate of new mutations at every site in the genome based on features of the surrounding DNA sequence, thus providing a common resource to study the arrival and maintenance of mutations in humans. Understanding such a basic process is important for answering fundamental questions in human evolution, the cause of inherited diseases, and the role of DNA abnormality in cancer and aging.            ",High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms,9083570,R01GM118928,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'European', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'data sharing', 'density', 'driving force', 'epigenomics', 'genetic evolution', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'next generation sequencing', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'repository', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,300999,0.026730130702277463
"Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes DESCRIPTION: The goal of this BD2K K01 application is to provide Dr. Jeremy W. Prokop with the mentoring and training to be an independent investigator in big data to knowledge. Mentoring and training will be provided to Dr. Prokop in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and statistics to advance his skill to allow for independence. This will allow for further develop of his sequence-to-structure-to-function analysis for interpretation of protein coding genetic variants into a usable workflow available to other scientists. The mentoring throughout this award will be from Dr. Howard Jacob, a leader in rat/human genetics and tool development to understand variants in whole genomes. Additionally, Dr. Andrew Greene serves as a co-mentor to help advance skills in proteomics and Dr. Christina Kendziorski as a co-mentor to advance statistical tools/approaches. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a leader in the use of whole genome sequencing in understanding human health, with a Cap/CLIA certified clinical sequencing facility, tools for identifying genetic variants from whole genomes (such as Carpe Novo), and operation of databases like the Rat Genome Database. These tools and knowledge at MCW will serve as an asset for the training and completion of the Aims in this award. Dr. Prokop's research focus in this grant is to further expand the sequence-to-structure-to-function approaches he developed during his Ph.D. and initial postdoc into a workflow and web submission server for other users. Aim 1 of the grant organizes these steps into a workflow allowing for the development of the web based submission server. To test the workflow, 75 candidate genes for cardiovascular disease will be screened. Initial use of the approach has revealed hypotheses for how genetic variants in Havcr1 and Shroom3 result in altered cardiovascular drug response or disease. Variants in these two proteins will be biochemically characterized using a novel decision tree to standardize experiments (Aim 2) and to serve as a quality control for the approaches of Aim 1. From the results of the 75 screened cardiovascular genes, the four genes with the highest confidence score will be validated using the biochemical decision tree in year four and five of this award serving as an additional quality control for the approaches in Aim 1. This grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Prokop to be integrated into the Medical College of Wisconsin's Clinical Sequencing program, allowing for additional R01 proposals for validation of genetic causes of disease, and facilitate the development of Dr. Prokop into an independent researcher in the use of big data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a new tool package that is able to interpret genetic variants of disease genomes into a testable hypothesis of how protein function is perturbed.

"Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our capacity to sequence human genomes has exceeded our ability to interpret genetic variation, particularly in non-coding regions. To address this challenge, we recently developed a novel framework, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), for estimating the deleteriousness of any genetic variant. CADD defines an objective, data-rich, and quantitative integration of many genomic annotations into a single measure of variant effect at the organismal level. The goals of this R01 proposal are to further develop the CADD framework, to apply it in the context of ongoing genetic studies of both rare and common human diseases, and to experimentally evaluate its predictions. In Specific Aim 1, we will substantially modify CADD in both straightforward and creative ways, with the goal of dramatically improving CADD's ability to annotate non- coding variants, not only to estimate their organismal effects but also to provide insights into molecular mechanisms. In Specific Aim 2, we will apply CADD to a variety of ongoing whole genome sequencing studies of human disease, especially those in which non-coding variants are either known or suspected to be causal. As part of this effort, we will develop new statistical frameworks that directly incorporat CADD into traditional genome-wide discovery approaches. In Specific Aim 3, we will perform a combination of high-throughput (massively parallel reporter assays), medium-throughput (CRISPR/Cas9), and low-throughput (in vivo mouse transgenics) experimental assays for systematic and targeted assessment of CADD predictions. This proposal includes both computational and experimental innovations, and builds on established collaborative relationships between investigators with complementary strengths. The completion of our aims will yield novel methods, data, and resources with which to annotate whole genome sequences, broadly enabling the field to more effectively identify and mechanistically understand non-coding genetic variants that are causally relevant to human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As we enter an era of personalized medicine, a deep understanding of human genomes will be increasingly important to public health, contributing to the unraveling of the genetic basis of human disease, as well as serving an increasing role in clinical diagnostics. However, our limited understanding of the functional consequences of most genetic variants, especially those that do not alter protein sequence, represents a major obstacle. This proposal seeks to dramatically improve our ability to identify and interpret ""non-coding"" variants that causally contribute to human disease. A recently developed computational approach will be substantially improved and evaluated in a variety of genetic studies, and its predictions will be experimentally validated. This project will provide much needed methods and resources to address the looming analytical challenges associated with individual whole genome sequencing in both biomedical research and patient care.",Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation,9024484,R01CA197139,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human genome sequencing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'research study', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,636532,0.056260874939747886
"Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to characterize the molecular and cellular causes of human disease, it will be essential to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation. However, we are currently unable to predict the impact of the majority genetic variants that lie in non-coding regions of the genome, where indeed most complex disease-associated variants are found. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that a significant fraction of the non-coding genome is likely to be functional, often playing a role in gene regulation. Therefore, our limited understanding of non- coding variation is a critical hurdle to characterizing the genetic basis of disease. The goal of this project is to develop methods for interpreting non-coding genetic variation: to provide a robust and extensible Bayesian method for predicting causal variants from full genomes, to identify and validate a large set of functional non- coding variants using CRISPR technology, and to predict disease-relevant traits likely to be affected by each variant. Our project will leverage a unique cohort from a founder population in Sardinia, with genome sequence and/or transcriptome data available from 3000 individuals, along with extensive phenotyping for hundreds of traits. We will combine advanced statistical modeling with experimental validation based on genome engineering to identify causal non-coding variants affecting biomedical traits in the cohort, along with predicting functional mechanisms through which these variants ultimately perturb the cell. In Aim 1, we develop computational methods for predicting causal non-coding variation from full genomes, incorporating informative genomic features including epigenetic data, sequence motifs, and conservation information into a Bayesian approach jointly modeling multiple transcriptomic signals. We will optimize and apply these methods on genome and transcriptome data available for the Sardinia cohort to identify a large set of variants predicted to causally affect gene expression. Based on these predictions, in Aim 2, we connect putative causal variants with the diverse set of disease-relevant traits measured in the cohort, using network inference to capture the cascade from genetic variation to gene expression to disease. We will develop methods to integrate across variants, using the models in Aim 1, to identify the common causal mechanisms related to each trait. In Aim 3, we validate the causal impact of non-coding variants predicted to affect high-level traits. We will us genome editing through CRISPR to introduce individual genetic variants into cell lines and use qPCR to validate the predicted effects on gene expression. Finally, a major goal throughout this proposal will be to provide the research community with convenient computational tools for the prediction of causal non-coding variants from individual genomes, updated on an ongoing basis to integrate the most recent genomic annotations and public data in order to provide the best possible accuracy in predicting causal variants and the traits they are likely to affect. Our projet will greatly advance our understanding of non-coding genetic variation, the specific mechanisms affected by causal variants, and the downstream consequences to the cell and individual health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Understanding the impact of variation in the entire genome, beyond the well-studied protein-coding regions, is essential to understanding the relationship between genetics and human health. This proposal addresses the problem of identifying functional non-coding genetic variants and predicting the impact of each variant on hundreds of disease-relevant traits.

"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of functional trait variants are polymorphic, non-coding and perturb transcription of a specific gene by altering the functions of their cis-regulatory elements. We propose a research paradigm for systematically identifying these non-coding trait variants, the regulatory functions they disrupt and the specific genes whose functions are altered at each quantitative trait locus. We will utilize integrative statisticl genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, using QT interval as a model 'system'. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform high- resolution mapping of GWAS signals to identify all polymorphic (>1%) and rare variants at loci that modulate the QT-interval; (2) to conduct in silico and in vitro analysis to predict and prioritize all cardiac regulatory (enhancer, silencer, insulator) elements and their cognate DNA-binding proteins; and, (3) to identify trait variants, genes and their mechanisms of genetic action. The overall goals are to improve the molecular genetic and mechanistic understanding of multifactorial traits for applications to other complex phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The electrocardiographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, has 68 predominantly non-coding variants at 35 loci explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance upon meta-analyses in >76,000 individuals of European and >11,000 individuals of African ancestry: nevertheless, the molecular details remain unknown. We propose a program of research for systematically identifying the functional non-coding quantitative trait variants, the regulatory function they disrupt and the specific gene whose functions are altered, at each locus.

"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9114170,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Mood Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phenomenological models', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2016,2560433,0.00024931659944876653

"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. The computational tools stemming from this research will enable efficient and accurate inference under complex population genetic models, thereby broadly facilitating research efforts to understand the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk.                ",Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics,8887722,R01GM094402,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic selection', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'open source', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'stem', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2015,303504,0.031102669510395486
"Inferring the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants identified in clinical whole- genome and whole-exome sequencing studies through the development of computational methods to predict functional effects of individual variants. Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of individuals; however, interpreting the clinical significance of the hundreds of thousands of genetic variants identified in these studies remains a critical challenge. Gene expression regulation is one mechanism by which variants can result in disease or other clinically-significant phenotypes. This mechanism is likely to be particularly important for disease-causing variants that do not directly affect protein structure by altering an amino acid sequence. The methods developed here will enable researchers to predict whether genetic variants are likely to have a regulatory effect on gene expression. The first stage of the project is to build computational models to predict such regulatory effects using a random forest machine learning approach. These models will be trained to recognize regulatory variation using a set of variants that have been shown to be involved in expression regulation in a recent study of gene expression across hundreds of individuals. Separate algorithms will be developed to predict two different types of regulatory effects: changes in the total amount of RNA produced from a particular gene (expression level variation) and changes in the specific form of RNA produced from a particular gene (splicing or isoform ratio variation). The second stage of the project is to evaluate the performance of these models on gene expression datasets from a separate human population and from different tissues within the human body, to explore their generalizability and to determine to what extent the characteristics of regulatory variants are conserved across tissues and populations. The final stage of the project is to use genetic variants in publicly-available databases that are known to be pathogenic to characterize how well these models perform at predicting clinical significance. This stage will test the hypothesis that variants that regulate gene expression are more likely to be clinically significant than variants that do not regulate expression. This project will impact public health by providing useful tools to improve prediction of the clinical significance of genetic variants identified in genome- scale sequencing studies. In addition, the project will provide biological insight into the tissue-specificity and population-specificity of genomic features that characterize regulatory genetic variants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of patients and other individuals. However, interpreting the clinical significance of the hundreds of thousands of genetic variants identified in these studies remains a critical challenge. This project will provide useful tools to improve automated prediction of the clinical significance of such genetic variants as well as their regulatory effects on gene expression.            ",Inferring the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and splicing,8835598,F32HG008330,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organized by Structure Protein', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Prostate', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Specificity', 'Spliced Genes', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2015,52306,0.070950603651756
"Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All genetic variation is created by mutations, changes that arise due to DNA damage or copying mistakes during DNA replication. Mutations are frequent enough that, on average, a child's 3-billion base pair genome contains 74 new genetic variants that are not present in the genome of either parent. Such new mutations confer a higher disease risk than older mutations because they have not passed the test of surviving through several generations of parents and offspring. We aim to pinpoint how the human mutation rate has evolved as humans left Africa and adapted to diverse new environments across the globe.  One specific aim will follow up on my preliminary research which showed that Europeans experienced a mutation rate change after diverging from Africans and Asians. The primary evidence for this change is that European genomes have a higher burden than African or Asian genomes of the mutation type TCC→TTC, where the trinucleotide ""TCC"" has experienced a mutation from ""C"" to ""T"" at its central site. We wish to and the genetic basis of this mutation rate change by looking at rare variants in mixed- ancestry Latino and African-American individuals. Specially, we will isolate young genetic variants that probably arose via mutation within the past 10-15 generations, after gene ow from Europe into the Americas had already begun. We will infer the genetic background (European, African, or Native American) upon which each new mutation arose and look for genomic regions where European ances- try correlates strongly with an excess of TCC→TTC mutations. These will be the regions most likely to harbor a causal allele that changed the process of mutation accumulation in Europeans. This work has the potential to yield valuable insights into melanoma, a cancer that predominantly affects individuals of European ancestry and whose somatic mutational signature is dominated by TCC→TTC.  A second specific aim is to look for other signatures of mutation rate change that have occurred within the human species or, more broadly, within the great apes. We will use a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify collections of mutation types whose rates appear to be under common genetic control. A few mutation types besides TCC→TTC show weak signals of rate differentiation between populations, and we will attempt to infer how many separate mutation rate change events are necessary to explain these signals. The admixture mapping technique from Specific Aim I can also be adapted to interrogate the genetic basis of other mutation rate changes that might have occurred in the recent past. These efforts should improve our understanding of the human mutation rate's genetic architecture and how mutation rates differ between populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All genetic variation is created by mutations, the copying mistakes that occasionally happen during DNA replication. There is evidence that children born with a higher burden of new mutations are at increased risk for autism, schizophrenia, and serious congenital diseases [1, 2, 3], but it is not well understood how much the human mutation rate varies and what genetic risk factors affect the mutation rate [4]. We aim to follow up on preliminary evidence that the Europeans have a higher mutation rate than Asians or Africans [5], looking for the genetic basis of this rate difference and investigating how often the mutation rate has changed during human evolution.",Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate,8982093,F32GM116381,"['Acceleration', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Americas', 'Architecture', 'Asians', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base Pairing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Cancer Biology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Europe', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Latino', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parents', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'insight', 'melanoma', 'offspring', 'rare variant', 'success', 'trait', 'transition mutation']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2015,50690,0.04168032501575783
"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing. The impact of genetic variation on splicing is not well understood. The goal of this research project i to computationally identify features of variants useful in predicting aberrant splicing, then incorporate the features into a machine learning algorithm and test the utility of the predictions using publically available sequencing studies. 1            ",Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing,8833507,F31HG007804,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Inherited', 'Introns', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'improved', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,43120,0.02759783607627793
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants. Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.",Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation,8822892,R01HG006264,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Housing', 'Human Genetics', 'Intervention', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Splicing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,300300,0.0729124336809166
"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease. The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.",Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations,8919917,R01GM104125,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Inbreeding', 'Influentials', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Recombinants', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'genetic resource', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'prospective', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,241086,0.03319328498476981
"Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations. Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified. The next step to use this information to improve human health is to determine how these changes alter cellular function. Here, methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with these genetic studies are proposed to enable investigators to generate hypotheses regarding the function of these genetic changes.",Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE,9090935,U01HG007033,"['Achievement', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Indium', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'neoplastic', 'risk variant', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2015,362142,0.033099433813771964
"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,8892240,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart rhythm', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,1254784,0.1150374168342617
"Integrating epigenomic maps to predict regulatory functions of genetic variants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illnesses are some of the most devastating diseases affecting human populations, placing a huge burden on individuals, families and society. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with psychiatric diseases, but a majority of those SNPs have been mapped to intergenic or intronic regions and are functionally unclassified. Existing software or algorithms only query multiple databases and produce lists of hits without intelligent integration and ignore much of the valuable regulatory information. The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate all available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data to generate a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression level in brain. Our previous studies have shown that psychiatric GWAS signals are enriched with brain eQTL SNPs (eSNPs), and these brain eSNPs are likely to be functional and contribute to disease susceptibilities. We will use SNPs in eQTLs to anchor a chain of evidence incorporating histone marks, conserved sequences, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation, accessible chromatins, non-coding RNA, and other data. We will use a machine learning method to predict regulatory SNPs based on known relationships between these epigenetic marks and their target genes, as well as their distinct patterns in genome. We will also use our novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type (i.e., neuron vs. non-neuron) specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our predictions. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Quantitative PCR and CRISPR-cas9 will be used on induced pluripotent cell lines to compare gene expression levels of alleles of predicted functional SNPs. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will made public via a website and standalone application. The novel algorithm will significantly improve our understanding of psychiatric disease genetics by uncovering the gene-regulatory functions for disease-associated, non-coding SNPs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common SNPs associated with major complex diseases, but the majority of those SNPs are located in non-coding regions, leaving those genetic associations functionally unexplained. Existing functional predication software or algorithms only query some databases without providing statistical or biological integration, and dismiss much valuable regulatory information. We propose to integrate all the available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data and use machine learning to produce a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression levels in brain. We will also use a novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our prediction.

"An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity.

"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced. We will validate our findings with a replication analysis in which we use an independent cohort dataset to quantify the association of the tested variants with the original GWAS phenotype.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis in the coronary or cerebrovascular circulation is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. Numerous DNA variations have been associated with these disorders, but the causal genes are unknown.

"Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to decipher the genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with the chromatin modification information in human immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that IBD results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to intestinal microbes in a genetically susceptible host. Among complex diseases, GWAS methods have been successful in IBD, identifying hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci. However, the majority of these disease-associated DNA variants fall into the gene-desert part of the genome, complicating their functional evaluation. There is now overwhelming evidence that the noncoding disease-associated DNA variants disrupt the action of key regulatory elements in relevant cell types. Since genomic coordinates of active regulatory elements can be charted using unique chromatin features, genome-wide profiling of chromatin modifications in relevant cell types can be used to pinpoint to DNA variants disrupting active regulatory elements.  Two recent studies discovered a novel kind of enhancers that occurs within exceptionally large genomic domains. These regions were initially dubbed as 'super-enhancers'. Super-enhancer domains occur at key identity genes in a variety of cell types. Strikingly, these enhancer domains are more sensitive to perturbation such as loss of transcription factors than typical shorter enhancers.  Because of the fragility of super-enhancers to perturbation, I postulate that super-enhancer domains of relevant immune cells harbor IBD-associated DNA variants. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 of this proposal, I will characterize super-enhancer structures of the human immune system. I will first develop an unsupervised machine learning technique to chart super-enhancer structures from histone acetylation (H3K27Ac) data in diverse immune cells. Using this technique, I will next delineate cell type- specific enhancer domains in the immune cells and investigate the relationship among cells types with respect to their super-enhancer structures. In Aim 2 of this proposal, I will investigate the enrichment of IBD-associated DNA variants within the super-enhancers of the most relevant immune cells. I then link these variants to genes and pathways that they regulate and are affected in disease utilizing gene expression and long-range chromatin interaction datasets. Completion of these aims, along with training opportunities associated with this proposal will establish the necessary foundation for my career as an independent investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people in North America and Europe. GWAS methods have identified hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci in IBD. Yet, the functional effects of mos IBD-implicated variants remain largely unexplained. The finding that nearly 90% of these sites occur outside of protein-coding sequences suggests that many associated variants may instead have a role in gene regulation. Cell context is a key determinant of gene regulation but where IBD genetic variants are functional is largely unknown. This proposal seeks to utilize the chromatin structure of human immune cells to discover the cell context for IBD-associated variants. The identification of the pathogenic cell types as well as the molecular pathways that contribute to the disease will contribute greatly to our ability to treat patients.              ",Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),8749475,K22AI112570,"['Address', 'Affect', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Enhancers', 'Epithelial', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intestines', 'Junk DNA', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'NCAM1 gene', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Immunity', 'North America', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'cohort', 'commensal microbes', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K22,2015,161200,0.028123562171918633
"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study? (3) How to accurately capture possible interactions between multiple genetic factors and their joint contribution to phenotypic variation? In particular, we will develop data structures and efficient algorithms for accurate and robust significance assessment that account for local population structure and joint effect of multiple genetic factors.    The proposed computational tools will be integrated into software packages under common application framework adopted by the broad scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Existing methods are not able to adequately address the complexity of high throughput data.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.",Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences,8906910,R01HG007068,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'direct application', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'rare variant', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,371408,0.07171701089323362
"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers. We propose to connect pharmacogenomic variant discovery with novel high-throughput experimental approaches to deliver a resource to guide the use of individual pharmacogenomic information in personalizing drug treatment.            ",F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes,8933744,R24GM115277,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CYP2C19 gene', 'CYP2C9 gene', 'CYP2D6 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Assay', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Numerical value', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Source', 'TPMT gene', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'computerized data processing', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stability testing', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R24,2015,751729,0.05720863698169062
"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving methods for the 'early' detection of keratoconus will help patients avoid complications of LASIK surgery, allow us to identify genetic variants that contribute to its development, and design therapies to retard its progression.            ",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,8817912,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Family member', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Videokeratographies', 'Vision', 'base', 'bead chip', 'cardiovascular health', 'cholesterol control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'therapy design/development', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,661520,0.03355952289554403
"Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our capacity to sequence human genomes has exceeded our ability to interpret genetic variation, particularly in non-coding regions. To address this challenge, we recently developed a novel framework, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), for estimating the deleteriousness of any genetic variant. CADD defines an objective, data-rich, and quantitative integration of many genomic annotations into a single measure of variant effect at the organismal level. The goals of this R01 proposal are to further develop the CADD framework, to apply it in the context of ongoing genetic studies of both rare and common human diseases, and to experimentally evaluate its predictions. In Specific Aim 1, we will substantially modify CADD in both straightforward and creative ways, with the goal of dramatically improving CADD's ability to annotate non- coding variants, not only to estimate their organismal effects but also to provide insights into molecular mechanisms. In Specific Aim 2, we will apply CADD to a variety of ongoing whole genome sequencing studies of human disease, especially those in which non-coding variants are either known or suspected to be causal. As part of this effort, we will develop new statistical frameworks that directly incorporat CADD into traditional genome-wide discovery approaches. In Specific Aim 3, we will perform a combination of high-throughput (massively parallel reporter assays), medium-throughput (CRISPR/Cas9), and low-throughput (in vivo mouse transgenics) experimental assays for systematic and targeted assessment of CADD predictions. This proposal includes both computational and experimental innovations, and builds on established collaborative relationships between investigators with complementary strengths. The completion of our aims will yield novel methods, data, and resources with which to annotate whole genome sequences, broadly enabling the field to more effectively identify and mechanistically understand non-coding genetic variants that are causally relevant to human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As we enter an era of personalized medicine, a deep understanding of human genomes will be increasingly important to public health, contributing to the unraveling of the genetic basis of human disease, as well as serving an increasing role in clinical diagnostics. However, our limited understanding of the functional consequences of most genetic variants, especially those that do not alter protein sequence, represents a major obstacle. This proposal seeks to dramatically improve our ability to identify and interpret ""non-coding"" variants that causally contribute to human disease. A recently developed computational approach will be substantially improved and evaluated in a variety of genetic studies, and its predictions will be experimentally validated. This project will provide much needed methods and resources to address the looming analytical challenges associated with individual whole genome sequencing in both biomedical research and patient care.                ",Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation,8792292,R01CA197139,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human genome sequencing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,666593,0.056260874939747886
"Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population Enter the text here that is the new abstract information for your application. This section must be no longer than 30 lines of text. In order to characterize the molecular and cellular causes of human disease, it will be essential to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation. However, we are currently unable to predict the impact of the majority of genetic variants that lie in non-coding regions of the genome, where indeed most complex disease-associated variants are found. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that a significant fraction of the non-coding genome is likely to be functional, often playing a role in gene regulation. Therefore, our limited understanding of non- coding variation is a critical hurdle to characterizing the genetic basis of disease. The goal of this project is to develop methods for interpreting non-coding genetic variation: to provide a robust and extensible Bayesian method for predicting causal variants from full genomes, to identify and validate a large set of functional non- coding variants using CRISPR technology, and to predict disease-relevant traits likely to be affected by each variant. Our project will leverage the increasing availability of cohorts such as UK10K, GTEx, CARTaGENE and SardiNIA, with genome sequence and transcriptome data available from thousands of individuals, along with extensive phenotyping for hundreds of traits. We will combine advanced statistical modeling with experimental validation based on genome engineering to identify causal non-coding variants affecting biomedical traits in the cohort, along with predicting functional mechanisms through which these variants ultimately perturb the cell. In Aim 1, we develop computational methods for predicting causal non-coding variation from full genomes, incorporating multiple informative genomic features into a Bayesian approach. We will optimize and apply these methods on genome and transcriptome data available for well-studied and broadly-accessible cohorts to identify a large set of variants predicted to causally affect gene expression. Based on these predictions, in Aim 2, we connect putative causal variants with the diverse set of disease- relevant traits measured in the cohort, using network inference to capture the cascade from genetic variation to gene expression to disease. We will develop methods to integrate across variants, using the models in Aim 1, to identify the common causal mechanisms related to each trait. In Aim 3, we validate the causal impact of non-coding variants predicted to affect high-level traits. We will use genome editing through CRISPR to introduce individual genetic variants into cell lines and use qPCR to validate the predicted effects on gene expression. Finally, a major goal throughout this proposal will be to provide the research community with convenient computational tools for the prediction of causal non-coding variants from individual genomes, updated on an ongoing basis to integrate the most recent genomic annotations and public data in order to provide the best possible accuracy in predicting causal variants and the traits they are likely to affect. Our project will greatly advance our understanding of non-coding genetic variation, the specific mechanisms affected by causal variants, and the downstream consequences to the cell and individual health. 2. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Understanding the impact of variation in the entire genome, beyond the well-studied protein-coding regions, is essential to understanding the relationship between genetics and human health. This proposal addresses the problem of identifying functional non-coding genetic variants and predicting the impact of each variant on hundreds of disease-relevant traits. Our approach will focus on integrative, transformative methods for understanding mechanisms underlying the function of the human genome.                ",Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population,8792751,R01HG008150,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Founder Generation', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sardinia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Widespread Disease', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human data', 'human disease', 'human genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,477647,0.08210304684302432
"Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped thousands of common trait-influencing variants yet the overwhelming majority of trait loci have yet to be discovered. The goal of this proposal is to develop and apply statistical approaches that move beyond the standard GWAS paradigm to map additional trait-influencing variation within the human genome. Most of our proposed tools are based on a flexible high-dimensional framework called kernel machine regression, which we have had past success employing for powerful gene mapping of complex traits in GWAS and next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. We believe the inherent flexibility of the kernel framework makes it ideal for exploring new paradigms in gene mapping of complex human traits. Aim 1 proposes novel kernel methods for integrated analysis of both single-nucleotide variation data (derived from GWAS and/or NGS) and genomic data (such as gene-expression and methylation patterns) that we believe will provide improved power for trait mapping. Aim 2 proposes novel kernel methods for large scale gene-gene interaction analysis across the genome, as well as a computational approach that enables efficient adjustment for multiple testing when applying such exhaustive testing procedures. Aim 3 establishes novel kernel methods for association mapping of SNVs on the X chromosome. The flexible nature of kernel machines makes it ideal for modeling potential sex-specific effects on this chromosome and the methods further can accommodate random X inactivation. Aim 4 proposes novel kernel approach for robust analysis of rare trait-influencing variation within families; such family-based designs are generally not considered in current rare-variant procedures. We will evaluate these methods on large-scale datasets that we are actively involved in and will implement the methods in user-friendly software for public distribution (Aim 5). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel and powerful statistical tools for identifying genetic loci acting independently or in conjunction with other genetic/environmental factors to influence complex human diseases or disease-related quantitative traits.

"Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes DESCRIPTION: The goal of this BD2K K01 application is to provide Dr. Jeremy W. Prokop with the mentoring and training to be an independent investigator in big data to knowledge. Mentoring and training will be provided to Dr. Prokop in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and statistics to advance his skill to allow for independence. This will allow for further develop of his sequence-to-structure-to-function analysis for interpretation of protein coding genetic variants into a usable workflow available to other scientists. The mentoring throughout this award will be from Dr. Howard Jacob, a leader in rat/human genetics and tool development to understand variants in whole genomes. Additionally, Dr. Andrew Greene serves as a co-mentor to help advance skills in proteomics and Dr. Christina Kendziorski as a co-mentor to advance statistical tools/approaches. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a leader in the use of whole genome sequencing in understanding human health, with a Cap/CLIA certified clinical sequencing facility, tools for identifying genetic variants from whole genomes (such as Carpe Novo), and operation of databases like the Rat Genome Database. These tools and knowledge at MCW will serve as an asset for the training and completion of the Aims in this award. Dr. Prokop's research focus in this grant is to further expand the sequence-to-structure-to-function approaches he developed during his Ph.D. and initial postdoc into a workflow and web submission server for other users. Aim 1 of the grant organizes these steps into a workflow allowing for the development of the web based submission server. To test the workflow, 75 candidate genes for cardiovascular disease will be screened. Initial use of the approach has revealed hypotheses for how genetic variants in Havcr1 and Shroom3 result in altered cardiovascular drug response or disease. Variants in these two proteins will be biochemically characterized using a novel decision tree to standardize experiments (Aim 2) and to serve as a quality control for the approaches of Aim 1. From the results of the 75 screened cardiovascular genes, the four genes with the highest confidence score will be validated using the biochemical decision tree in year four and five of this award serving as an additional quality control for the approaches in Aim 1. This grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Prokop to be integrated into the Medical College of Wisconsin's Clinical Sequencing program, allowing for additional R01 proposals for validation of genetic causes of disease, and facilitate the development of Dr. Prokop into an independent researcher in the use of big data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a new tool package that is able to interpret genetic variants of disease genomes into a testable hypothesis of how protein function is perturbed.

"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of functional trait variants are polymorphic, non-coding and perturb transcription of a specific gene by altering the functions of their cis-regulatory elements. We propose a research paradigm for systematically identifying these non-coding trait variants, the regulatory functions they disrupt and the specific genes whose functions are altered at each quantitative trait locus. We will utilize integrative statisticl genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, using QT interval as a model 'system'. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform high- resolution mapping of GWAS signals to identify all polymorphic (>1%) and rare variants at loci that modulate the QT-interval; (2) to conduct in silico and in vitro analysis to predict and prioritize all cardiac regulatory (enhancer, silencer, insulator) elements and their cognate DNA-binding proteins; and, (3) to identify trait variants, genes and their mechanisms of genetic action. The overall goals are to improve the molecular genetic and mechanistic understanding of multifactorial traits for applications to other complex phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The electrocardiographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, has 68 predominantly non-coding variants at 35 loci explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance upon meta-analyses in >76,000 individuals of European and >11,000 individuals of African ancestry: nevertheless, the molecular details remain unknown. We propose a program of research for systematically identifying the functional non-coding quantitative trait variants, the regulatory function they disrupt and the specific gene whose functions are altered, at each locus. We utilize integrative statistical genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms in this model trait with the overall goal to improve the molecular understanding of all complex phenotypes.",GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES,8904675,R01GM104469,"['Action Potentials', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'African', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Base Sequence', 'Beer', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'EP300 gene', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enhancers', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insulator Elements', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Muscle Cells', 'Neonatal', 'Nuclear Extract', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Microchips', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Weight', 'base', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'novel', 'programs', 'promoter', 'rare variant', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,606539,0.06735169273661798
"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases.

"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing. Because much of the information required for such decisions is scattered among public and private databases, we propose combining the medical literature, expert summary of millions of de- identified genetic tests, and results from current and past NIH-funded genetic studies into a single unified database.",Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database,8738706,U01HG007436,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease Pathway', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Population Study', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Professional counselor', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'working group']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,2351999,0.10340883154185138
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants.          Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.              The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.

"Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations.           Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified. The next step to use this information to improve human health is to determine how these changes alter cellular function. Here, methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with these genetic studies are proposed to enable investigators to generate hypotheses regarding the function of these genetic changes.

"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.                ",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,8786636,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart rhythm', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,1308724,0.1150374168342617
"Integrating epigenomic maps to predict regulatory functions of genetic variants     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illnesses are some of the most devastating diseases affecting human populations, placing a huge burden on individuals, families and society. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with psychiatric diseases, but a majority of those SNPs have been mapped to intergenic or intronic regions and are functionally unclassified. Existing software or algorithms only query multiple databases and produce lists of hits without intelligent integration and ignore much of the valuable regulatory information. The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate all available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data to generate a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression level in brain. Our previous studies have shown that psychiatric GWAS signals are enriched with brain eQTL SNPs (eSNPs), and these brain eSNPs are likely to be functional and contribute to disease susceptibilities. We will use SNPs in eQTLs to anchor a chain of evidence incorporating histone marks, conserved sequences, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation, accessible chromatins, non-coding RNA, and other data. We will use a machine learning method to predict regulatory SNPs based on known relationships between these epigenetic marks and their target genes, as well as their distinct patterns in genome. We will also use our novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type (i.e., neuron vs. non-neuron) specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our predictions. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Quantitative PCR and CRISPR-cas9 will be used on induced pluripotent cell lines to compare gene expression levels of alleles of predicted functional SNPs. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will made public via a website and standalone application. The novel algorithm will significantly improve our understanding of psychiatric disease genetics by uncovering the gene-regulatory functions for disease-associated, non-coding SNPs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common SNPs associated with major complex diseases, but the majority of those SNPs are located in non-coding regions, leaving those genetic associations functionally unexplained.

We propose to integrate all the available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data and use machine learning to produce a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression levels in brain. We will also use a novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our prediction.

"An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity. Comprehensive identification and analysis of these genetic variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health and demography. Despite recent advances, the tools and data needed to comprehensively identify all types of SVs, genotype each variant, integrate and phase these variants remain lacking. Indeed, the data released from the early phases of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are biased primarily towards the detection of deletions within relatively unique regions of the genome.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.

"Informatic Profiling of Clinically Relevant Mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group focuses on genetic variants that disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In this renewal R01 application, we propose to begin the process of realizing our long-term goals, and to expand our original scope of research to include the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation in noncoding regions. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply these methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three aims. First, we will integrate predictions of protein-disease associations with mutation predictions to develop a new quantitative model of genotype and phenotype. Second, we will integrate each of these together to develop a systems level, molecular function genome annotator with functionality to import into the genome databases. Finally, we will continue to build new methods for characterization of mutations using sequence, function and structure and begin testing our published hypotheses. Each of these aims will include collaboration with the maintainers of genetic datasets to better understand their underlying molecular effects.

"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk. This project is focused on analysis of the relationship between genetic variation and common disease with the goal of identifying new therapeutic opportunities.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The PAGE study focuses on analysis of existing large samples of primarily non- European ancestry to broaden our understanding of the ethnic differences in the genetic basis of complex disease.

"Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped thousands of common trait-influencing variants yet the overwhelming majority of trait loci have yet to be discovered. The goal of this proposal is to develop and apply statistical approaches that move beyond the standard GWAS paradigm to map additional trait-influencing variation within the human genome. Most of our proposed tools are based on a flexible high-dimensional framework called kernel machine regression, which we have had past success employing for powerful gene mapping of complex traits in GWAS and next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. We believe the inherent flexibility of the kernel framework makes it ideal for exploring new paradigms in gene mapping of complex human traits. Aim 1 proposes novel kernel methods for integrated analysis of both single-nucleotide variation data (derived from GWAS and/or NGS) and genomic data (such as gene-expression and methylation patterns) that we believe will provide improved power for trait mapping. Aim 2 proposes novel kernel methods for large scale gene-gene interaction analysis across the genome, as well as a computational approach that enables efficient adjustment for multiple testing when applying such exhaustive testing procedures. Aim 3 establishes novel kernel methods for association mapping of SNVs on the X chromosome. The flexible nature of kernel machines makes it ideal for modeling potential sex-specific effects on this chromosome and the methods further can accommodate random X inactivation. Aim 4 proposes novel kernel approach for robust analysis of rare trait-influencing variation within families; such family-based designs are generally not considered in current rare-variant procedures. We will evaluate these methods on large-scale datasets that we are actively involved in and will implement the methods in user-friendly software for public distribution (Aim 5).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel and powerful statistical tools for identifying genetic loci acting independently or in conjunction with other genetic/environmental factors to influence complex human diseases or disease-related quantitative traits. Application of the proposed methods to applied datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of complex traits and enhance existing risk-prediction models of complex disease.

"Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes     DESCRIPTION: The goal of this BD2K K01 application is to provide Dr. Jeremy W. Prokop with the mentoring and training to be an independent investigator in big data to knowledge. Mentoring and training will be provided to Dr. Prokop in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and statistics to advance his skill to allow for independence. This will allow for further develop of his sequence-to-structure-to-function analysis for interpretation of protein coding genetic variants into a usable workflow available to other scientists. The mentoring throughout this award will be from Dr. Howard Jacob, a leader in rat/human genetics and tool development to understand variants in whole genomes. Additionally, Dr. Andrew Greene serves as a co-mentor to help advance skills in proteomics and Dr. Christina Kendziorski as a co-mentor to advance statistical tools/approaches. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a leader in the use of whole genome sequencing in understanding human health, with a Cap/CLIA certified clinical sequencing facility, tools for identifying genetic variants from whole genomes (such as Carpe Novo), and operation of databases like the Rat Genome Database. These tools and knowledge at MCW will serve as an asset for the training and completion of the Aims in this award. Dr. Prokop's research focus in this grant is to further expand the sequence-to-structure-to-function approaches he developed during his Ph.D. and initial postdoc into a workflow and web submission server for other users. Aim 1 of the grant organizes these steps into a workflow allowing for the development of the web based submission server. To test the workflow, 75 candidate genes for cardiovascular disease will be screened. Initial use of the approach has revealed hypotheses for how genetic variants in Havcr1 and Shroom3 result in altered cardiovascular drug response or disease. Variants in these two proteins will be biochemically characterized using a novel decision tree to standardize experiments (Aim 2) and to serve as a quality control for the approaches of Aim 1. From the results of the 75 screened cardiovascular genes, the four genes with the highest confidence score will be validated using the biochemical decision tree in year four and five of this award serving as an additional quality control for the approaches in Aim 1. This grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Prokop to be integrated into the Medical College of Wisconsin's Clinical Sequencing program, allowing for additional R01 proposals for validation of genetic causes of disease, and facilitate the development of Dr. Prokop into an independent researcher in the use of big data.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a new tool package that is able to interpret genetic variants of disease genomes into a testable hypothesis of how protein function is perturbed.

"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of functional trait variants are polymorphic, non-coding and perturb transcription of a specific gene by altering the functions of their cis-regulatory elements. We propose a research paradigm for systematically identifying these non-coding trait variants, the regulatory functions they disrupt and the specific genes whose functions are altered at each quantitative trait locus. We will utilize integrative statisticl genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, using QT interval as a model 'system'. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform high- resolution mapping of GWAS signals to identify all polymorphic (>1%) and rare variants at loci that modulate the QT-interval; (2) to conduct in silico and in vitro analysis to predict and prioritize all cardiac regulatory (enhancer, silencer, insulator) elements and their cognate DNA-binding proteins; and, (3) to identify trait variants, genes and their mechanisms of genetic action. The overall goals are to improve the molecular genetic and mechanistic understanding of multifactorial traits for applications to other complex phenotypes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The electrocardiographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, has 68 predominantly non-coding variants at 35 loci explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance upon meta-analyses in >76,000 individuals of European and >11,000 individuals of African ancestry: nevertheless, the molecular details remain unknown. We propose a program of research for systematically identifying the functional non-coding quantitative trait variants, the regulatory function they disrupt and the specific gene whose functions are altered, at each locus. We utilize integrative statistical genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms in this model trait with the overall goal to improve the molecular understanding of all complex phenotypes.                ",GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES,8625164,R01GM104469,"['Action Potentials', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'African', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Base Sequence', 'Beer', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'EP300 gene', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enhancers', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Functional RNA', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insulator Elements', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Muscle Cells', 'Neonatal', 'Nuclear Extract', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Microchips', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Weight', 'base', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'epigenomics', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'novel', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,621641,0.06735169273661798
"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.                ",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),8698507,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2014,2625284,0.00024931659944876653
"Pharmacogenomics of serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, have not shown conclusive linkage or association study results. Today, an enormous portion of heritability for depression remains unexplained. Rather than reiterating studies attempting to identify genetic variants underlying depression pathophysiology, I propose a different approach of evaluating genetic variation in the safety and efficacy of the major class of antidepressants. I will identify patients with the quantitative and discrete phenotypes of serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) response (as measured through the Patient's Health Questionnaire-9 pre- and post-SSRI treatment), and SSRI-associated serious side effects, such as abnormal bleeding and serotonin syndrome. After identification of these phenotypes from the electronic Medical Records and Genetic Epidemiology (eMERGE) consortium, I will perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 50,109 subjects to identify candidate genes involved in SSRI pharmacology and then leverage overlapping exome sequence data to identify rare, potentially causative mutations. As many GWAS and rare variant studies suffer from a lack of functional validation (i.e., that the identified variant truly causes the phenotype), I will functionally valiate these identified rare mutations in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a yeast growth-based assay as a direct measure of protein function. The P450 enzyme CYP3A4, which has been implicated in SSRI metabolism, will be used as a proof of concept for the yeast assay. Finally, I will then use this yeast growth assay to perform deep mutational scanning to create a pharmacogenomic map of all possible mutations and their effect on enzyme hydrolysis, thereby linking DNA sequence to protein function. This work will provide a unique resource for understanding SSRI pharmacology. Through completion of a GWAS on the pharmacogenomic phenotypes of SSRI response and separately, risk of SSRI-associated bleeding and serotonin syndrome, I will likely identify numerous candidate genes that may further inform on the metabolism, transport, and mechanism of action of SSRIs, thereby furthering basic science. Moreover, through functional validation and creation of a pharmacogenomic map with deep mutational scanning, I will create an invaluable resource for clinicians to interpret the likely efect of their patient's rare mutation. Through this project, I hope to further the effort to bring personalized, genomic medicine into clinical practice, to decrease the morbidity and mortality of depression, which is estimated by the Center for Disease Control to affect 1 in 10 adults in the U.S.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is affects 1 in 10 adults in the United States and is one of the leading causes of disability.

"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing. Because much of the information required for such decisions is scattered among public and private databases, we propose combining the medical literature, expert summary of millions of de- identified genetic tests, and results from current and past NIH-funded genetic studies into a single unified database.",Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database,8574128,U01HG007436,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease Pathway', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Population Study', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Professional counselor', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'working group']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2013,1400000,0.10340883154185138
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants.          Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.        While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.              The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.

"Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations.           Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified. The next step to use this information to improve human health is to determine how these changes alter cellular function. Here, methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with these genetic studies are proposed to enable investigators to generate hypotheses regarding the function of these genetic changes.

"An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity. Comprehensive identification and analysis of these genetic variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health and demography. Despite recent advances, the tools and data needed to comprehensively identify all types of SVs, genotype each variant, integrate and phase these variants remain lacking. Indeed, the data released from the early phases of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are biased primarily towards the detection of deletions within relatively unique regions of the genome. As a consortium, we propose to pool expertise from various research groups to provide an integrative analysis of SVs by combining rigorous computational algorithmic development with extensive experimental validation.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.            ",Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences,8528145,R01HG007068,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'direct application', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'public health relevance', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,382699,0.07171701089323362
"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group focuses on genetic variants that disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In this renewal R01 application, we propose to begin the process of realizing our long-term goals, and to expand our original scope of research to include the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation in noncoding regions. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply these methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three aims. First, we will integrate predictions of protein-disease associations with mutation predictions to develop a new quantitative model of genotype and phenotype. Second, we will integrate each of these together to develop a systems level, molecular function genome annotator with functionality to import into the genome databases. Finally, we will continue to build new methods for characterization of mutations using sequence, function and structure and begin testing our published hypotheses. Each of these aims will include collaboration with the maintainers of genetic datasets to better understand their underlying molecular effects.

"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk. This project is focused on analysis of the relationship between genetic variation and common disease with the goal of identifying new therapeutic opportunities.                ",Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease,8431505,R01GM104436,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Explosion', 'Floods', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'new technology', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2013,278213,0.07878472269012363
"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The PAGE study focuses on analysis of existing large samples of primarily non- European ancestry to broaden our understanding of the ethnic differences in the genetic basis of complex disease.

"Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped thousands of common trait-influencing variants yet the overwhelming majority of trait loci have yet to be discovered. The goal of this proposal is to develop and apply statistical approaches that move beyond the standard GWAS paradigm to map additional trait-influencing variation within the human genome. Most of our proposed tools are based on a flexible high-dimensional framework called kernel machine regression, which we have had past success employing for powerful gene mapping of complex traits in GWAS and next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. We believe the inherent flexibility of the kernel framework makes it ideal for exploring new paradigms in gene mapping of complex human traits. Aim 1 proposes novel kernel methods for integrated analysis of both single-nucleotide variation data (derived from GWAS and/or NGS) and genomic data (such as gene-expression and methylation patterns) that we believe will provide improved power for trait mapping. Aim 2 proposes novel kernel methods for large scale gene-gene interaction analysis across the genome, as well as a computational approach that enables efficient adjustment for multiple testing when applying such exhaustive testing procedures. Aim 3 establishes novel kernel methods for association mapping of SNVs on the X chromosome. The flexible nature of kernel machines makes it ideal for modeling potential sex-specific effects on this chromosome and the methods further can accommodate random X inactivation. Aim 4 proposes novel kernel approach for robust analysis of rare trait-influencing variation within families; such family-based designs are generally not considered in current rare-variant procedures. We will evaluate these methods on large-scale datasets that we are actively involved in and will implement the methods in user-friendly software for public distribution (Aim 5). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel and powerful statistical tools for identifying genetic loci acting independently or in conjunction with other genetic/environmental factors to influence complex human diseases or disease-related quantitative traits.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.                      Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.        While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to quickly identify data sets of interest, expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate test incorporating multiple phenotypes, and perform larger meta-analyses easily by honing in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest with increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel.

"Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified. The next step to use this information to improve human health is to determine how these changes alter cellular function. Here, methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with these genetic studies are proposed to enable investigators to generate hypotheses regarding the function of these genetic changes.               Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC.

"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group focuses on genetic variants that disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In this renewal R01 application, we propose to begin the process of realizing our long-term goals, and to expand our original scope of research to include the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation in noncoding regions. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply these methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three aims. First, we will integrate predictions of protein-disease associations with mutation predictions to develop a new quantitative model of genotype and phenotype. Second, we will integrate each of these together to develop a systems level, molecular function genome annotator with functionality to import into the genome databases. Finally, we will continue to build new methods for characterization of mutations using sequence, function and structure and begin testing our published hypotheses. Each of these aims will include collaboration with the maintainers of genetic datasets to better understand their underlying molecular effects.

"Methods for high-resolution analysis of genetic effects on gene expression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Summary Gene expression is a fundamental function of any cell. It is the main mechanism by which information is transmitted from the nucleus to the rest of the cell and eventually to other cells and the body of the organism. Genetic variation in components of the transcriptional machinery and signals that regulate gene function generates variation in transcriptional response and consequently variation in phenotypes. It has become apparent that many of the common genetic signals associated with disease are found away from the DNA sequence that encodes for protein sequence and is likely to be functioning in regulating gene expression. In this project we propose to develop methodologies that will explore the consequences of genetic variation in gene expression. There are three main goals of this project. First we will explore and develop methodologies to mine information from experiments that perform deep sequencing of the human transcriptome. The new sequencing technologies are providing us with unprecedented resolution into the transcriptome but are also raising challenges in the computational and biological models to use to interpret such large amounts of data. Secondly, we will use high-resolution genetic data to develop and use methodologies to dissect the fine structure of genetic variants that affect regulation of gene expression. Finally, we will implement and test models to infer the higher-order interactions of genome function so as to dig deeply into the biological consequences of genetic variants and how the signal is transmitted from the DNA sequence to higher levels of cell and body function. Our goals is to develop methodologies that will significantly improve our insight to the variability in human populations and assist in interpreting predisposition to genetic diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Project narrative The proposed project aims at the development of statistical methods for the interpretation and study of the impact of genetic variants in cell function. Understanding the cellular effects of genetic variants provides a fundamental framework for the deep understanding of human genetic disease and increases the potential for the development of relevant treatments and drugs. It is the understanding of the basic molecular functions in health and disease that will provide the utmost resolution of information for the improvement of human health.

"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC. Ultimately, this work may improve our ability to treat KC and/or prevent the development of KC.          n/a",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,8018102,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Study Subject', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Videokeratographies', 'Work', 'aquaporin 5', 'case control', 'cohort', 'corneal epithelium', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2011,672532,0.015648317974780668
"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group focuses on genetic variants that disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In this renewal R01 application, we propose to begin the process of realizing our long-term goals, and to expand our original scope of research to include the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation in noncoding regions. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply these methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three aims. First, we will integrate predictions of protein-disease associations with mutation predictions to develop a new quantitative model of genotype and phenotype. Second, we will integrate each of these together to develop a systems level, molecular function genome annotator with functionality to import into the genome databases. Finally, we will continue to build new methods for characterization of mutations using sequence, function and structure and begin testing our published hypotheses.

"Methods for high-resolution analysis of genetic effects on gene expression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Summary Gene expression is a fundamental function of any cell. It is the main mechanism by which information is transmitted from the nucleus to the rest of the cell and eventually to other cells and the body of the organism. Genetic variation in components of the transcriptional machinery and signals that regulate gene function generates variation in transcriptional response and consequently variation in phenotypes. It has become apparent that many of the common genetic signals associated with disease are found away from the DNA sequence that encodes for protein sequence and is likely to be functioning in regulating gene expression. In this project we propose to develop methodologies that will explore the consequences of genetic variation in gene expression. There are three main goals of this project. First we will explore and develop methodologies to mine information from experiments that perform deep sequencing of the human transcriptome. The new sequencing technologies are providing us with unprecedented resolution into the transcriptome but are also raising challenges in the computational and biological models to use to interpret such large amounts of data. Secondly, we will use high-resolution genetic data to develop and use methodologies to dissect the fine structure of genetic variants that affect regulation of gene expression. Finally, we will implement and test models to infer the higher-order interactions of genome function so as to dig deeply into the biological consequences of genetic variants and how the signal is transmitted from the DNA sequence to higher levels of cell and body function. Our goals is to develop methodologies that will significantly improve our insight to the variability in human populations and assist in interpreting predisposition to genetic diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Project narrative The proposed project aims at the development of statistical methods for the interpretation and study of the impact of genetic variants in cell function.

"Genetics Variants in the Genome Predisposing to Aggressive PCa DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fortunately, most men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) will not die from their disease, and some men diagnosed may not even require treatment for their cancers. However, on the other end of the spectrum, ~30,000 men annually die from PCa in the US alone. For these latter men, the concept of PCa as an indolent disease obviously does not apply. Understanding the molecular basis of aggressive PCa (aPCa) vs. indolent PCa (non-aPCa) is perhaps the most important basic, yet translational question in PCa biology. We hypothesize that multiple sequence variants in the genome confer risk to aPCa but not to non-aPCa. Taking advantage of the publicly available CGEMS genome wide association data, as well as the large and unique PCa patient population at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH), we propose a systematic genetic association study to confirm, fine map, and better characterize genetic risk variants for aPCa. We propose three specific aims: 1)Test the genetic variants implicated in the CGEMS study that distinguish aPCa from non-aPCa among ~3,000 aPCa and ~5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, 2) Fine map the genomic regions for the SNPs implicated in Aim 1 among 3,000 aPCa and 5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, and 3) Assess the association of the most significant SNPs found in Aim 2 with disease characteristics in all 8,000 patients, and with disease progression in a subset of patients that have follow-up data at JHH. In addition, we have two exploratory aims: 1) fine mapping of regions containing SNPs significant in European Americans in aPCa and non-aPCa in African Americans, and 2) testing for gene-gene interaction. Besides the obvious clues that the proposed research may provide in terms of etiologic mechanisms, this study may also lead to identification of new target genes and proteins for therapy and possible preventive strategies. Furthermore, the identification of multiple variants can lead to the development of a test panel that may improve prediction of aPCa risk. Project Narrative  Prostate cancer is a common cancer that varies widely in its aggressiveness. The ability to predict which men  are at risk for the development of aggressive prostate cancer is urgently needed. This proposal addresses the  possibility that genetic variants may differentiate risk for aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancer and  the results can be used to predict men at higher risk for aggressive prostate cancer.",Genetics Variants in the Genome Predisposing to Aggressive PCa,8037735,R01CA133009,"['17q', '17q12', '17q24.3', '8q24', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Pathological Staging', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling Errors', 'Severity of illness', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer risk', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease characteristic', 'disease natural history', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genome-wide linkage', 'high risk', 'high risk men', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,585183,0.026213677398870972
"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"Human Variation Detection and Visualization on the DNAnexus Web 2.0 platform    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNAnexus proposes to develop a complete solution for the identification and stratification of personal genetic variation from ultra-high-throughput sequencing projects. The solution will be implemented as a Web 2.0 service and online browsing tool that will integrate public data sources such as the 1000 genomes project, comparative information, and the ENCODE II project data. Users will be able to browse and stratify the identified variation in the context of these genomic annotations, and according to the likely functional impact. In Phase I of our project, we will develop a basic browser for displaying sequence reads that are mapped to a reference genome with our state-of-the-art read mapper. The browser will support viewing mate paired reads as well as display of the variation between these reads and the reference genome. It will facilitate the algorithmic development that we will perform during Phase II, and it will be the foundation for the more sophisticated variation browser also proposed in Phase II. In Phase II, we will develop algorithms for detecting genomic variation, and a state-of-the-art browser for viewing variation in the context of existing genome annotations, functional genomic and comparative genomic data. Our algorithms for detecting variation will support all major types of genomic variation, including SNPs, microindels, larger insertions and deletions, duplications, copy number variations, inversions, and translocations. Our algorithms will be based on state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning methodology for human genome resequencing. The DNAnexus browser will have two components: a list browser that displays variation as a list filtered and stratified by criteria that a user chooses, and a powerful GUI whose navigation capabilities are inspired by modern online tools such as Google Maps.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNAnexus proposes to develop a complete solution for identifying and analyzing personal genetic variation for individuals whose genomes are sequenced using new sequencing technologies.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC. Ultimately, this work may improve our ability to treat KC and/or prevent the development of KC.          n/a",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,7780356,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Study Subject', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Videokeratographies', 'Work', 'aquaporin 5', 'case control', 'cohort', 'corneal epithelium', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2010,680924,0.015648317974780668
"Methods for high-resolution analysis of genetic effects on gene expression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Summary Gene expression is a fundamental function of any cell. It is the main mechanism by which information is transmitted from the nucleus to the rest of the cell and eventually to other cells and the body of the organism. Genetic variation in components of the transcriptional machinery and signals that regulate gene function generates variation in transcriptional response and consequently variation in phenotypes. It has become apparent that many of the common genetic signals associated with disease are found away from the DNA sequence that encodes for protein sequence and is likely to be functioning in regulating gene expression. In this project we propose to develop methodologies that will explore the consequences of genetic variation in gene expression. There are three main goals of this project. First we will explore and develop methodologies to mine information from experiments that perform deep sequencing of the human transcriptome. The new sequencing technologies are providing us with unprecedented resolution into the transcriptome but are also raising challenges in the computational and biological models to use to interpret such large amounts of data. Secondly, we will use high-resolution genetic data to develop and use methodologies to dissect the fine structure of genetic variants that affect regulation of gene expression. Finally, we will implement and test models to infer the higher-order interactions of genome function so as to dig deeply into the biological consequences of genetic variants and how the signal is transmitted from the DNA sequence to higher levels of cell and body function. Our goals is to develop methodologies that will significantly improve our insight to the variability in human populations and assist in interpreting predisposition to genetic diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Project narrative The proposed project aims at the development of statistical methods for the interpretation and study of the impact of genetic variants in cell function. Understanding the cellular effects of genetic variants provides a fundamental framework for the deep understanding of human genetic disease and increases the potential for the development of relevant treatments and drugs.

"Genetics Variants in the Genome Predisposing to Aggressive PCa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fortunately, most men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) will not die from their disease, and some men diagnosed may not even require treatment for their cancers. However, on the other end of the spectrum, ~30,000 men annually die from PCa in the US alone. For these latter men, the concept of PCa as an indolent disease obviously does not apply. Understanding the molecular basis of aggressive PCa (aPCa) vs. indolent PCa (non-aPCa) is perhaps the most important basic, yet translational question in PCa biology. We hypothesize that multiple sequence variants in the genome confer risk to aPCa but not to non-aPCa. Taking advantage of the publicly available CGEMS genome wide association data, as well as the large and unique PCa patient population at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH), we propose a systematic genetic association study to confirm, fine map, and better characterize genetic risk variants for aPCa. We propose three specific aims: 1)Test the genetic variants implicated in the CGEMS study that distinguish aPCa from non-aPCa among ~3,000 aPCa and ~5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, 2) Fine map the genomic regions for the SNPs implicated in Aim 1 among 3,000 aPCa and 5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, and 3) Assess the association of the most significant SNPs found in Aim 2 with disease characteristics in all 8,000 patients, and with disease progression in a subset of patients that have follow-up data at JHH. In addition, we have two exploratory aims: 1) fine mapping of regions containing SNPs significant in European Americans in aPCa and non-aPCa in African Americans, and 2) testing for gene-gene interaction. Besides the obvious clues that the proposed research may provide in terms of etiologic mechanisms, this study may also lead to identification of new target genes and proteins for therapy and possible preventive strategies. Furthermore, the identification of multiple variants can lead to the development of a test panel that may improve prediction of aPCa risk.                                                 Project Narrative  Prostate cancer is a common cancer that varies widely in its aggressiveness. The ability to predict which men are at risk for the development of aggressive prostate cancer is urgently needed. This proposal addresses the possibility that genetic variants may differentiate risk for aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancer and the results can be used to predict men at higher risk for aggressive prostate cancer.",Genetics Variants in the Genome Predisposing to Aggressive PCa,7788795,R01CA133009,"['17q', '17q12', '17q24.3', '8q24', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Haplotypes', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Pathological Staging', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling Errors', 'Severity of illness', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer risk', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease characteristic', 'disease natural history', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genome-wide linkage', 'high risk', 'high risk men', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,620255,0.026213677398870972
"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"Machine Learning Analysis of Genetic Modulators of Vaccine Immune Response Abstract Machine Learning Analysis of Genetic Modulators of Vaccine Immune Response. This proposal describes the development of a machine-learning strategy to identify interacting susceptibility loci in polygenic biological endpoints, with a focus on smallpox and anthrax vaccine-related adverse events (AEs) and variation in serologic antibody response. The appearance of AEs following smallpox vaccination stems from excess stimulation of inflammatory pathways and is likely affected by multiple, interacting genetic factors. Some of these gene-gene interactions may be epistatic, having no distinct marginal effect for any single variant. Analytical approaches are needed for testing association in genome-wide data to account for conditional dependencies between genetic variants while still accounting for co-occurring variants with high marginal effects. We have introduced a machine-learning feature selection and optimization method called Evaporative Cooling (EC), which is based on information theory and the statistical thermodynamics of cooling a system of interacting particles by evaporation. The objective of the EC learner is the identification of susceptibility or protective genes in genome-wide DNA sequence data. This novel filter method, which includes no assumptions regarding gene interaction architecture or interaction order, has been shown to identify a spectrum of disease susceptibility models, including marginal main effects and pure interaction effects. Characterizing the genetic basis of multifactorial phenotypes in genome-wide sequence data is also computationally challenging due to the presence of a large number of noise variants, or variants that are irrelevant to the phenotype. Thus, the EC algorithm evaporates (i.e., removes) noise variants, leaving behind a minimal collection of variants enriched for relevance to the given phenotype. We propose to advance this method to characterize and interpret singe-gene, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions all of which may modulate complex phenotypes such as vaccine-associated AEs and human immune response. This strategy will be developed with the aid of artificial data, simulated under a variety of conditions observed in real data, and the strategy will be tested on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and clinical data from volunteers from a NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine and a Center for Disease Control sponsored trial to evaluate Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed. Susceptibility to common complex disorders is likely due to a combination of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions as well as single-gene associations. In this proposal, we will develop a new bioinformatics strategy for identifying networks of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence susceptibility to complex disorders from genome-wide data. The proposed strategy will be developed to identify networks associated with adverse events and the human immune response following smallpox and anthrax vaccination.",Machine Learning Analysis of Genetic Modulators of Vaccine Immune Response,7919847,R56AI080932,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anthrax Vaccines', 'Anthrax disease', 'Antibody Formation', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Engineering', 'Gases', 'Gene Combinations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Theory', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Serological', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'evaporation', 'forest', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'novel', 'open source', 'particle', 'stem', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,R56,2009,346329,0.014593830471099026
"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits.

In our currently funded R01, we are developing methods we call in silico functional profiling. This method works by learning residue-specific protein function and then estimates when it is disrupted. This research funds our efforts to characterize what the underlying molecular disruption a protein mutation is causing and thereby improve accuracy of these approaches. In this competitive revision application, we are proposing to expand our efforts to the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation or transcript splicing. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply all of our methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three supplemental aims. First, we will evaluate genomic features for prediction of regulatory nucleotide substitutions and construct new methods to aid in their classification. Second, we will collaboratively work to develop machine learning methods for classification of nucleotide substitutions that disrupt transcript splicing.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).

"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution.

"MODELS IN POPULATION GENETICS The genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region control a variety          Of functions involved in the immune response, and influence                      susceptibility to over 40 diseases.  Our understanding of the structure          and function of the HLA genes, their disease associations, and the               evolutionary features of this multigene family has benefitted from recent        advances in molecular biology, immunology, disease modelling and                 population genetics.  Theoretical studies in the development of models to        determine the modes of inheritance of the HLA associated diseases have           led to a better understanding of the inheritance patterns in insulin             dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,           ankylosing spondylitis, hemochromatosis, celiac disease, and others.  It         is now clear that many of the HLA associated diseases involve                    heterogeneity in their HLA components, as well as non-HLA genetic                components.                                                                                                                                                       The specific aims of our research are to study the genetic components in         the etiology of the HLA associated diseases, and population genetic              features of the HLA system.  A variety of methods to test modes of               inheritance of diseases using marker allele information, will be                 developed.  Methods appropriate for the analysis of marker systems which         are not highly polymorphic, to both detect linkage and determine modes of        inheritance, will be investigated.  The information content of particular        pedigree types for LOD score analysis will be investigated.  Two methods         using patterns of linkage disequilibrium will be investigated to                 determine their usefulness in mapping disease predisposing genes.  A             number of large collaborative data sets of HLA associated diseases will          be analyzed.  A framework for genetic counselling of HLA associated, and         other complex diseases, will be developed.

"Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most disease-associated variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome and exert their influence through effects on gene expression. However, we lack a predictive framework to interpret such non-coding variants, limiting how genomic data is used in precision medicine. We may be able to interpret non-coding variants with new machine learning algorithms, but so far the practical applications of machine learning in functional genomics have been limited because of two major challenges. First, the size and diversity of training data sets in functional genomics are orders of magnitude smaller than in applications where machine learning has been successful, such as image recognition and product recommendation. A second challenge is that if training data are not collected in an appropriate in vitro cellular model, then the resulting machine learning models may not generalize to relevant in vivo cell types. To improve the application of machine learning to non-coding variants, I propose to address both the limited size of training data sets and the efficacy of cell culture models. A core principle of machine learning is that model performance improves with more data. In Aim 1, I propose to increase the size and diversity of training data by performing iterative cycles of machine learning and experimental validation with Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). The key aspect of my approach is to algorithmically design each successive MPRA library to contain sequences that are most likely to improve the next round of modeling. I recently trained my first model on data that I collected from MPRA experiments of cis-regulatory sequences that function in mammalian photoreceptors. To avoid any issues with cell lines, I performed these experiments in ex vivo developing retinas, which retain the appropriate tissue architecture. However, unlike photoreceptors, most cell types are not experimentally tractable in their native physiological context. Thus, it will be important to determine how well in vitro cell lines recapitulate in vivo cis-regulation. In Aim 2, I propose to determine whether a tractable cell culture model can recapitulate results from ex vivo retinas. I will use existing MPRA data from ex vivo retinas as a standard to compare against data collected in cell lines engineered to express combinations of photoreceptor transcription factors. I aim to address whether engineering tractable cell lines to express tissue-specific transcription factors might be a general approach for collecting data to train machine learning models that generalize to in vivo systems. Successful completion of these aims will produce a general approach to increase the size and diversity of functional genomic training data, and may result in a general method for producing experimentally tractable systems for machine learning applications, ultimately helping us better apply genomic data to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many genetic variants that cause disease do not affect the structure of genes, but instead affect short DNA sequences that control when, where, or how much a gene is produced. Every individual human contains thousands of genetic variants in these control regions, but only a small number of these variants influence gene production. I propose a combined experimental and computational framework to predict which variants affect gene production and which variants are harmless.",Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning,10065897,F31HG011431,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Performance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Retina', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'cellular engineering', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'practical application', 'precision medicine', 'synthetic biology', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,31454,0.028810419277825808
"A Multivariate Mediation and Deep Learning Framework for Genome-Connectome -Substance Use Research Substance use and addiction are complex biopsychosocial disorders influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. A key challenge in addiction genetics research is to understand how multiple genetic variants interactively influence addiction traits through impacting the central nervous system. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale mediation analysis framework to identify addiction-related gene-brain circuitry pathways, using nicotine addiction as the targeted disorder, although the platform will be readily applicable for other addiction-related disorders and phenotypes. We will fully leverage the complex and interactive interdependent relationships between the imaging-genetics data and perform multivariate statistical inference with simultaneously increased statistical power and reduce false positive rates. The results will precisely identify multiple sets of genetic variants that interactively alter brain functional and structural circuitries, and then influence nicotine addiction. We will further supplement the mediation results with deep learning algorithms to study how genetic variants non-linearly and interactively coordinate to influence nicotine addiction and explain the phenotypic variance. Novel network topology based convolutional and pooling functions will be developed to achieve optimal prediction accuracy of addiction traits using genome-connectome pathways. All models and findings will be carefully validated through multiple independent large-sample data sets of imaging-genetics studies for nicotine addiction for ensuring the replicability and reliability of our findings derived from this framework. We plan to produce a freely available and user-friendly software incorporating the mediation analysis framework and deep learning algorithms enabling the complex whole genome - connectome analysis for addiction genetics research. Nicotine addiction is a worldwide public health priority and imposing health and economic burden on millions of individuals and families. This proposal seeks to identify how multiple genetic variants interactively influence the nicotine addiction through impacting brain circuitries.

"Integrative approaches to identification and interpretation of genes underlying psychiatric disorders Psychiatric disorders contribute substantially to the disease burden in the United States and worldwide. There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to many psychiatric illnesses. In recent years, with the advancement of high throughput genomic technologies and the availability of large samples, remarkable success has been made in risk gene discovery for major psychiatric disorders [e.g., schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)] through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, due to the high complexity of the human genome, few causal genes or variants have been identified within GWAS risk loci, thus, to date, limiting the potential of translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms. There is now a great need to pinpoint causal genes/variants at the known GWAS risk loci and to understand their causal mechanisms, as well as to discover novel genes from novel risk loci. There is also growing evidence that risk variants from GWAS tend to be located in regulatory DNA regions in disease-relevant tissues or cell types, suggesting that risk variants may act through regulation of gene expression. Studies leveraging diverse functional genomic resources may benefit psychiatric risk gene discovery and result in better prediction of their biological relevance. This proposal aims to employ highly integrative approaches to identify causal genes and regulatory noncoding variants underlying SCZ, BD, and MDD. Our specific aims are: 1) Integrate GWAS with brain methylome for risk gene discovery, by leveraging a dense high-resolution reference panel of DNAm from whole genome bisulfite sequencing of DNA from three different brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate) and an enlarged array-based reference panel; 2) Apply a deep learning approach to predicting disease-relevant regulatory variants, by employing features from disease-relevant gene regulatory networks and functional genomic annotations within brain tissues and neural cell types; and 3) Map prioritized genes and variants to specific brain cell types and brain function. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with expertise in psychiatric genetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Our goal is to apply multidisciplinary and cutting-edge analytical strategies to help address the challenges arising in the post-GWAS era. The identification and characterization of risk genes and noncoding regulatory variants would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illnesses, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment for these disorders. Project Narrative: This proposal takes integrative approaches to prioritizing genes and noncoding variants underlying psychiatric disorders through better leveraging functional genomic resources to predict their biological relevance.

"Scalable detection and interpretation of structural variation in human genomes PROJECT SUMMARY Structural variation (SV), is a diverse class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications, as well as balanced rearrangements, such as inversions and reciprocal translocations. A typical human genome harbors >4,000 SVs larger than 300bp and their large size increases the potential to delete or duplicate genes, disrupt chromatin structure, and alter expression. Despite their prevalence and potential for phenotypic consequence, SVs remain notoriously difficult to detect and genotype with high accuracy. Much of this difficulty is driven by the fact DNA sequence alignment “signals” indicating SVs are far more complex than for single-nucleotide and insertion deletion variants. Unlike SNP alignments that vary only in allele state, alignments supporting SVs vary in state (supports an alternate structure or not) alignment location, and type. Consequently, the accuracy of SV discovery is much lower than that of SNPs and INDELs. Furthermore, SV pipelines scale poorly and are difficult to run. These challenges are a barrier for single genome analysis and studies of families must invest substantial effort into eliminating a sea of false positives. These problems become exponentially more acute for large-scale sequencing efforts such as TOPmed, the Centers for Common Disease Genetics, and the All of Us program. Software efficiency is key to scalability for such projects. However, of equal importance is comprehensive, accurate discovery.  Building upon more than a decade of software development experience and analyzing SV in diverse disease contexts, we have invested significant effort into understanding the causes of the insufficient accuracy for SV discovery. These efforts, together with our research and development experience in this area, give us unique insight into improving the accuracy and scalability of SV discovery. Our goal is to narrow the accuracy gap between SNP/INDEL variation and structural variation discovery. These developments will empower studies of human genomes in diverse contexts and will therefore have broad impact. Our goals are to: 1. Develop a deep learning model to correct systematic variation in sequence depth. This new machine  learning model will correct systematic biases in DNA sequence depth and dramatically improve the  discovery of deletions and duplications. 2. Improve the speed, scalability, and accuracy of SV detection and genotyping. Using new algorithms,  we will bring the accuracy of SV detection much closer to that of SNP and INDEL discovery and allow  accurate SV discovery to be deployed at scale. 3. Create a map of genomic constraint for SV from population-scale genome analysis. We will deploy  our new methods to detect and genotype structural variation among tens of thousands of human genomes.  The resulting SV map will empower the creation of a model of genomic constraint for SV and enable new  software to predict deleterious SVs, especially in the noncoding genome. PROJECT NARRATIVE Single-nucleotide DNA changes paint an incomplete picture of a human’s genome. A more complete picture must include a genome's structural variation (SV), an important class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications. However, existing methods have poor accuracy. As the genetics community transitions to large-scale genome sequencing studies, there is an acute need for improved SV discovery methods. This proposal introduces a series of algorithmic and software innovations that will empower SV discovery, genotyping, and interpretation in large-scale human disease studies.",Scalable detection and interpretation of structural variation in human genomes,9973582,R01HG010757,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Clip', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Exhibits', 'Family Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Structure', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Paint', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reciprocal Translocation', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Systematic Bias', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'dosage', 'exome', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'method development', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'prevent', 'research and development', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'variant detection', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,692048,0.004535852594021657
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,9886261,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Community Medicine', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'data preservation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,371859,0.008728221155157966
"Advancing Multi-Omics and Electronic Health Records Computational Methodologies PROJECT SUMMARY  Phenomic advances from large-scale electronic health records (EHR) linked to DNA biobanks have pioneered an efficient approach to genetic discovery that has transformed human genetic studies, with the enormous potential to provide constraints on relevant biological mechanisms on a wide spectrum of human phenotypes. Nevertheless, our understanding of the downstream molecular consequences of genetic associations remains limited and impedes our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases. Given their enormous discovery potential for human genomics and precision medicine, genetic analyses in diverse populations offer unprecedented opportunities to identify causal genetic mechanisms underlying human trait variation.  This research proposal aims to address these convergent developments and critical gaps and to exert a powerful influence on efforts to expand our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Here we hypothesize that a comprehensive multi- omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology will provide a robust and rigorous framework. This proposal thus has the following aims: AIM 1: Develop a regularized regression based methodology and a deep learning framework to improve characterization of the genetic architecture of gene expression and to build robust prediction models, extending a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methodology (called PrediXcan) that we developed. AIM 2: Develop statistical causal modeling of trait-associated genetic variation through a convergent TWAS and Mendelian Randomization approach and apply it to thousands of human traits with available GWAS and EHR data. AIM 3: Develop analytic approaches and software tools to further genetic analyses in admixed and multi-ethnic populations and to lay the groundwork for trans-ethnic multi-omic methodologies, using EHR data (e.g., BioVU, UK Biobank, All of Us). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE We will develop a comprehensive multi-omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology that bridges the gap between Genetic Epidemiology and Functional Genomics. This research provides a rigorous framework for investigating relevant mechanisms underlying complex traits, including disease risk and quantitative traits.

"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,9948713,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'regression algorithm', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,190941,0.050193593990260084
"Leveraging Common Fund data for feature selection in Kids First studies. Project Abstract This project will pilot a process for identifying multi-variant interactions contributing structural birth defect and childhood cancer disorders. This study will focus on analysis of oral-facial clefts, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and congenital heart defects from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from family cohorts taken from Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project (KF).  Typically, tests to link disorders to genome-wide complex multivariate associations are computationally prohibitive. Thus, a first step to making such analyses more reasonable is to limit the number of variables (genes, variants) being tested together. We can reduce the number of possible tests by restricting what data should be tested. This study will seek to reduce the data for testing by utilizing biological knowledge from other two Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. KOMP2 has generated extensive information on mouse knockout developmental phenotypes relevant for matching gene and phenotypes in KF WGS studies. GTEx can be merged with KF loci and relevant tissue-to-phenotype relationships. Thus, using features from other Common Fund data and annotations, we can generate selected subsets of KF variants and genes as feature-reduced KF data.  A comprehensive machine learning (ML) analysis pipeline will then be utilized for the identification of candidate risk factors and characterization of complex patterns of association between these feature-reduced KF data. In addition to performing the more traditional univariate association analyses of genotype vs. phenotype, this pipeline will also identify complex associations including (1) context-dependent genetic effects resulting from non-additive multi-variant interactions, i.e. epistasis, and (2) subgroup-specific associations, i.e. by phenotype and genotypic heterogeneity, where different etiological paths lead to the same/similar phenotypes in the selected KF subject group. This pipeline will include feature selection, modeling, and interpretation of multi-variant interactions.  The outcomes of this study will include (1) pipelines for integrating Common Fund data into Kids First datasets, (2) integrated KF-KOMP2-GTEx datasets including cross-species integration, (3) ML pipelines for multi-variant interaction analyses of phenotype vs genotype in selected, reduced-feature KF data, and (4) results from the aforementioned pipelines for multi-variant interactions for later hypothesis testing. Project Abstract This project will pilot a process for identifying interactions between genetic variants that contribute to structural birth defect and childhood cancer disorders by combining data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project with biological knowledge from other two Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. By selective use of this merged data within machine-learning pipelines, we will produce novel genetic analysis methods for studying complex variant interactions that may contribute to these childhood disorders.",Leveraging Common Fund data for feature selection in Kids First studies.,10112014,R03OD030600,"['Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Congenital diaphragmatic hernia', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Oral', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Research', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Services', 'Source', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'cohort', 'complex data ', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'feature selection', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'insight', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'whole genome']",OD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2020,363306,0.01244257874378261
"The fitness effects of de novo structural variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) focuses on the training of Dr. PingHsun Hsieh to become an independent investigator of large-scale genomics and human population genetics. Dr. Hsieh is a population geneticist by training, and the proposed studies will advance his training into long-read- based sequencing technologies and novel machine-learning approaches to study the fitness consequences of new mutations, with a focus on structural variants (SVs), in humans and nonhuman primates. Another essential piece will be the development of resources on which types of new SVs are most likely to be pathogenic and hence most worth further effort by medical researchers. The methods developed in this work will enable other researchers to do more hypothesis-free analysis of SVs in disease etiology. Specifically, the training program will center on the study of the distribution of fitness effects of new SVs in human and nonhuman primates using high-quality SV calls and genotypes from several large-scale long- and short-read sequencing projects. The mentored work will take place under the supervision of the primary mentor, Dr. Evan Eichler, and the co-mentor, Dr. Sharon Browning, both at the University of Washington (UW). The mentor and co-mentor are well-established experts in the characterization of genomic variations using high-throughput technologies and the development of stochastic modeling methods for large-scale genetic data, respectively. Dr. Hsieh will also gain advice from a formal advisory committee as well as through activities arranged by the Department of Genome Sciences (GS), which is an optimal place for the mentored training providing the candidate with access to outstanding scientists in areas including genetics of model organisms, disease, population genetics, and the development of high-throughput genomic technologies. While found in nature and yet generally deemed to be deleterious given their size, SVs can be beneficial, and thus, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new SVs (i.e., the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious SVs) remains elusive. In the proposed studies, we will infer the DFE of new SVs and other variants to assess their relative importance in nature, which in turn helps prioritize variants (e.g., SVs vs. single- nucleotide variants [SNVs]) in medical genetics. Specifically, in the K99/R00 phases we will (1) infer the DFE of new SVs and SNVs using a diverse panel of ~100 long-read and ~4,000 short-read high-coverage human and nonhuman primate genomes; (2) compare the DFE of new mutations among primates using contemporary and ancient DNA genomes; and (3) study the fitness effects and selective constraints on diseases in different mutation categories in large cohorts of >20,000 genomes. The skills learned in this proposal are on the cutting-edge and are tailored for the candidate to amass a great amount of knowledge in new areas of genomics, which will be applicable to many organisms and diseases and critical to the candidate’s future independent laboratory. NARRATIVE Understanding the relative abundance of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious mutations in different variant categories (e.g., genic vs. intergenic) provides useful guidance and resources for biomedical researchers to prioritize disease-causing mutations and strategize their efforts. To date, however, little effort has been made to study the full spectrum of fitness effects of new structural variants – an important but largely underappreciated genomic variation. The work proposed here seeks to leverage long-read sequencing technologies and develop novel machine-learning approaches to quantify the fitness effects of new mutation, with a focus on structural variants, and subsequently delineate the relative importance among different types of mutations in genetic diseases.",The fitness effects of de novo structural variants,9950314,K99HG011041,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Award', 'Base Pairing', 'Benchmarking', 'Categories', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical resource', 'career', 'cohort', 'disease-causing mutation', 'expectation', 'fitness', 'genome sciences', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human population genetics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pressure', 'simulation', 'skills', 'technology development', 'trait']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,132244,0.029599133520616612
"Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is distinctive amongst the inflammatory/autoimmune joint diseases in that its onset is commonly preceded by cutaneous psoriasis (PsC). This provides an unparalleled opportunity for the identification of predictive biomarkers to determine which of the approximately 25% of psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) patients will develop PsA. Over the past decade, we have expanded our genetic study of PsV to focus on PsA, resulting in the collection of 1,279 PsA patients at Michigan, 743 of whom have already been subjected to GWAS. Initiated in 2007, the International Psoriatic Arthritis Research Team (IPART) has accumulated 1,919 Canadian PsA patients, of whom 1,370 have already been subjected to GWAS. In 2015, we completed a meta- GWAS of PsC and PsA involving a discovery cohort of 1,430 PsA cases and 1,417 controls, with 9,293 additional PsV replication samples (3,061 PsA, 3,110 PsC) and 13,670 controls. We detected 10 associations for PsA and 11 for PsC, as well as a new association for PsV. Utilizing an innovative core exome array to genotype additional cases and controls, we carried out the largest meta-GWAS of PsV to date (~40,000 subjects) and found 16 more susceptibility regions, highlighting the roles of interferon signaling and the NFB cascade, and demonstrating strong enrichment for psoriasis genetic signals in T-cell regulatory elements. Using machine learning to model ~200 genetic variants in our PsA vs. PsC GWAS, we achieved 82% area under receiver operator curve for distinguishing PsA vs PsC, with 98% accuracy among the top 10% of patients with the highest genetic load. We also carried out RNA-seq on mRNA and miRNA from 65 pairs of pre- and post-conversion samples from PsC patients who developed PsA. Suggestive of a shift from skin- focused to systemic autoimmunity, we found significant post-conversion enrichment for central memory CD4+ T-cell (CD4-Tcm) transcripts among the up-regulated genes. We also observed highly correlated pre- and post- conversion behaviors of 54 differentially-expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets, as well as multiple serum miRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed in PsA vs. PsC. A metabolomic study of 50 paired converter sera revealed 293 biochemicals with significant alterations, 275 of which were increased. Finally, we identified noncoding eQTLs for IL23R that correlate strikingly with a region of selective PsA association.  Based on these results, we hypothesize that PsA and PsC have pathogenetic mechanisms that are T-cell, osteoblast and osteoclast-driven and progress from skin to systemic during transition to PsA. We propose that this paradigm can be used to develop a useful test to predict PsA in PsC patients, while increasing our basic understanding of PsA. To test this hypothesis, we propose four aims: (1) to maintain and grow our longitudinal clinical resource; (2) To identify biomarkers for the development of PsA in PsC patients; (3) To integrate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2 into a clinically-useful tool for PsA identification using machine learning ; and (4) to explore the mechanisms by which the IL23R gene contributes to PsA pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. The mechanisms that predispose patients with psoriasis to develop PsA are unknown. The proposed research will utilize the power of genome-wide association studies, transcriptome analysis, metabolomics, and the largest longitudinal resource of PsA in the world to develop a clinically-relevant tool for PsA prediction and to address a major gap in our mechanistic understanding of the causes of PsA.

"Diversity Supplement for Prioritization of Splicing-Altering Genetic Variants in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop computational pipelines that allow in silico prediction of functional genetic variants that disrupt pre-mRNA splicing and related pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in AD genomes of various patient cohorts. The next great challenge is to identify causal variants and elucidate their potential function relevant to disease processes. To this end, research efforts have been directed to studying variants located in protein-coding, promoter, and splice site regions due to their apparent impacts on gene expression. However, many of the newly identified disease-associated variants reside in other non-coding regions, such as introns, that may confer regulatory function to the related gene. The mechanisms of these variants have been hard to decipher. It is expected that many of them may function at the post-transcriptional level, thus affecting mRNA expression. In human, a myriad of processes mediate RNA expression at the post-transcriptional stage, one of which being splicing. Splicing is an essential step of mammalian gene expression and alternative splicing affects most human genes. Recent literature reported that RNA splicing is a primary link between GVs and disease. In general, it was estimated that 15-60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In AD, aberrant splicing has been detected in many functionally critical genes, some of which are modulated by GVs. Despite the importance, how to accurately identify functional genetic variants in splicing regulation remains a key question in the field. To address this question, the large collection of RNA-Seq and genotyping data sets collected from AD and control subjects represent an invaluable resource. We will develop and apply novel methodologies to make full use of these data sets, complemented by further bioinformatic prediction and experimental validations. This work will allow a previously unattained level of understanding of genetic variants in splicing regulation and provide new means to tackle the imperative task of functional annotations of genetic variants in AD. Project Narrative Alternative splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) mechanisms. The proposed research aims to develop computational pipelines, aided by experimental validation, to predict functional genetic mutations or polymorphisms that cause splicing changes in AD.

"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9893003,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2020,336445,0.026395505626329363
"Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing of complex diseases have revealed a plethora of disease risk variants, most of which lie in noncoding regions of DNA without easily interpretable function. A main functional mechanism of noncoding variants is to alter chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), thereby influencing gene expression. Predicting the effects of noncoding variants on TF binding and gene expression on a large scale is thus important but remains challenging. Available computational tools for predicting regulatory variants largely rely on TF-binding motif models and/or local chromatin modification features. Here, we aim to develop a novel computational framework to address two major limitations of these methods. First, given that known disease causal noncoding variants often reside outside of TF binding motifs, how can we improve the prediction of TF binding variants outside of motifs? For this, we plan to integrate TF ChIP-seq data with features that are important for TF binding but have not been considered in previous methods, in particular the DNA breathing dynamics (AIM1). DNA breathing reflects local transient opening of the DNA double helix due to thermal fluctuations. We have shown that genetic variants can affect nearby (up to a few hundred base pairs) DNA breathing dynamics that affect TF binding. Using TF ChIP-seq data, we will train models that predict specific TF binding variants in or outside TF motifs, incorporating DNA breathing dynamics with other features such as DNA shapes and cooperative TF binding. Secondly, given that chromatin features only show modest (<2-fold) enrichment of genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits, how can we improve the prediction of regulatory variants? For this, we will build a computation model, considering the allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA; i.e., two alleles of a heterozygous individual show read imbalance in chromatin accessibility assays) as a functional readout of a regulatory variant (AIM2). We have shown that neuronal ASCA SNPs are highly enriched for those implicated by schizophrenia (SZ) GWAS. Using neuronal ASCA data, we will train models that predict variants with regulatory effects, taking advantage of our TF-specific classifiers (from AIM1). As a proof of concept, the models will be applied to a large SZ GWAS dataset to predict putative causal regulatory variants. We will validate the effects of the predicted top-ranking regulatory SZ variants on gene expression in a well-powered hiPSC sample by combining multiplex CRISPR-based SNP editing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis (AIM3). For SNPs showing the strongest regulatory effects, we will further use CRISPR editing to verify the SNP effect on gene expression and disease-relevant neuronal phenotypes. Accurately predicting TF-affecting noncoding variants will enable better understanding of the large number of noncoding variants implicated in complex disorders and help formulate testable biological hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapeutics. NARRATIVE We will develop novel computational methods and a cost-effective functional validation approach to systematically infer the effect of disease-associated noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and gene expression. Identifying the functional noncoding variants that are associated with disease risk will help illuminate causal molecular mechanisms, facilitating the clinical translation of genetic findings into disease risk prediction and treatment.",Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants,9908170,R01MH116281,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adenine', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cell Line', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'chromatin modification', 'clinical translation', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost effective', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'support vector machine', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIMH,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2020,592430,0.05423559736077329
"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5). Project Narrative We will develop statistical methods and computational software to analyze whole genome/exome sequencing data by integrating multiple phenotypes and functional annotations to identify novel genes associated with cardiometabolic diseases and allow researchers to better disentangle the impacts of rare variants on these complex human diseases. It will also facilitate the translation of basic research findings into clinical studies.",Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data,9972090,R01GM134005,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome Scan', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,328257,0.0556002624385534
"Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing Abstract  Modern genetics has identified many genetic variants that affect traits such as height, but most phenotypic variation still cannot be explained by these variants alone. Importantly, differences in environment often result in individual variation of traits—including disease risk and drug response—for different genotypes. These relationships are known as genotype by environment (GxE) interactions. For example, the sickle cell allele of hemoglobin S causes sickle cell anemia, but also provides a fitness advantage in the presence of malaria by conferring resistance to infection. However, there are few examples where the exact causal variants are known. Therefore, we need to develop new methodology for identifying more of these GxE interactions, to improve prediction of disease risk and treatment outcomes.  In this study, I will fill in the gap of knowledge in GxE interactions by establishing an experimental framework for identifying hundreds of causal GxE variants in parallel, providing the first comprehensive view of GxE causal variant landscape. Specifically, I will study how thousands of genetic variants between a laboratory yeast strain (BY) and a vineyard strain (RM) lead to their differences in growth upon stress and drug treatments, as one form of GxE interaction. In Aim 1, I will use a novel gene-editing technology that can detect the fitness effects of thousands of variants in one experiment, as shown in a pilot experiment. Using this method, I will be able to map hundreds of casual variants that contribute to growth differences under various conditions, such as carbon source, oxidative stress and drug treatment. In Aim 2, I will measure allele-specific mRNA expression (ASE) from BYxRM F1 hybrids in above-mentioned conditions and associate the mapped causal GxE variants, to identify GxE variants that influence growth rate through gene expression. Then, I will apply a machine learning model to predict causal GxE genes using the molecular features found in this study. By mapping causal GxE variants, linking them to gene expression and predicting causal genes through gene expression, I will establish a complete framework for accelerating the discovery of GxE interactions. Public Health Relevance The recent explosion of precision medicine based on genotype and mutations has enabled personalized treatment of diseases. However, how environmental factors influence the outcome of such treatments is not clear. By establishing a framework to study general principles and underlying molecular mechanisms of these gene-by-environment interactions, we will be able to integrate such knowledge in disease risk prediction and personalized treatment.",Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing,9905312,F31ES030282,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Models', 'Carbon', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactase', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meiotic Recombination', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Sickle Cell', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Hemoglobin', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'career', 'causal variant', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mRNA Expression', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'precise genome editing', 'precision medicine', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'segregation', 'skills', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,29520,0.05066128287047834
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,9820729,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Auditory Threshold', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Tests', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic testing', 'hard of hearing', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing loss phenotype', 'hearing preservation', 'hereditary hearing loss', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,508845,0.058753033392126466
"Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX SUMMARY Deficiencies in coagulation factor IX (FIX) cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, while high levels of FIX pose a risk for thrombosis. Thus, genetic variation in the F9 gene encoding FIX can impact bleeding by decreasing FIX expression or activity, or can impact thrombosis by increasing FIX expression or activity. However, when a new DNA variant is discovered in the F9 gene, we typically lack the evidence needed to confidently determine if the variant alters the function of the encoded FIX protein and, if so, how severely. For example, in the national hemophilia genotyping project MyLifeOurFuture, the majority of F9 missense variants (i.e. DNA changes predicted to change a FIX amino acid) discovered in patients with hemophilia B had insufficient evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Functional studies, where a FIX variant’s stability, activity or other properties are evaluated in vitro, can provide strong evidence to inform interpretation of F9 variants. However, traditional functional studies are time- and resource-intensive, so testing the hundreds of F9 variant we have observed so far would be impractical. Evaluating the thousands of possible FIX missense variants we could observe as more individuals are sequenced would be impossible. Instead, we propose a new approach to express and characterize nearly every possible missense variant in the FIX protein to advance our understanding of FIX biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the F9 gene, and advance hemophilia care and treatments. To accomplish this goal, we will employ deep mutational scanning, a method we developed for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Here, we will display a library of nearly all possible FIX missense variants tethered to the surface of cultured human cells. We propose to exploit this FIX surface display library in two aims: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on FIX expression and secretion, and 2) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on specific FIX functions including Gla-domain gamma-carboxylation and activation of FIX by factor XIa (FXIa). These aims will reveal how nearly all possible missense variants in FIX impact expression, secretion, gamma- carboxylation, and activation by FXIa. In aim 3, we will use these large-scale functional data to dissect the mechanism by which F9 pathogenic variants disrupt FIX function. We will also use machine learning, leveraging the functional data along with other features to predict pathogenicity for each missense variant in FIX. Taken together, the functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of F9 variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand FIX biology, improve the clinical translation of F9 genetic information, and inform new treatments. NARRATIVE DNA changes that affect the F9 gene that makes coagulation factor IX (FIX) can reduce FIX levels and cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, or increase the amount of active FIX and increase the risk of thrombosis. Although hundreds of variants have been detected in the F9 gene, there is often insufficient information to know how any one specific change will affect the protein, if that change will cause disease, or how severe disease will likely be. We will use new technologies to study the consequences of every possible amino acide change in FIX, with the goal of developing the information needed to understand the significance of new genetic changes as they are discovered in the future and to improve the care and treatment of patients.",Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX,9946710,R01HL152066,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'F9 gene', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor IX', 'Factor XIa', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hemophilia A', 'Hemophilia B', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'carboxylation', 'clinical translation', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'tool']",NHLBI,BLOODWORKS,R01,2020,418577,0.06450703148611549
"Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP) The advent of next generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized gene discovery in human diseases, including epilepsy. Hundreds of genes have been implicated in epilepsy in the last decade, revealing the diversity of biological mechanisms that can go awry in this disorder. However, the rate at which we are identifying new genes involved in epilepsy is now outpacing our ability to study disease mechanisms. Moreover, clinical gene panel or exome sequencing has become standard practice for patients with early-onset, familial, and refractory epilepsies. This rapid assimilation of genetic testing into clinical care has led to a surge in the number of genetic variants of uncertain significance (VUS), particularly the occurrence of missense VUS. These VUS are assigned to an indeterminate spectrum between pathogenic and benign, which complicate interpretation for genetic counselors, clinicians, patients and families, as well as assessment of the need for further testing. Here we propose a Center without Walls, entitled Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP), spanning 5 institutions and incorporating expertise from geneticists, clinicians, computational biologists, neuroscientists, stem cell biologists, pharmacologists and electrophysiologists who have a proven track record of collaborative publications and grants, as well as stature as leaders of national and international epilepsy organizations. EpiMVP will develop a modular, highly integrated platform approach to accelerate determination of the functional, pharmacological, neuronal network and whole animal consequences of genetic variants implicated in a range of clinical epilepsy types. We will study non-ion-channel, non-receptor genes commonly implicated in epilepsy, and that are involved in diverse biological processes. Our ultimate goals are to devise an effective experimental platform for testing the pathogenicity of VUS in genes implicated in epilepsy and to generate a computational model (EpiPred) that predicts the likelihood that a variant is pathogenic or benign. This work is crucial in the pursuit of novel therapeutics and the promise of personalized medicine. The overall milestones of the Center are: 1. Evaluate genes associated with epilepsy and select candidates for analysis, model data for, and analyze all project data for development of EpiPred an iterative machine learning model to classify variants in genes implicated in epilepsy. 2. Test selected VUS using medium throughput, in vitro approaches. 3. Test selected VUS in human cortical neurons or human brain organoids using induced pluripotent stem cell approaches. 4. Test selected VUS in pre-clinical, in vivo models. The expected outcomes are: 1. Provide a freely available prediction tool for clinicians to differentiate between pathogenic and benign variants for genes implicated in epilepsy; 2. Provide experimental models to study the functional consequences of specific variants; 3. Provide a reclassification of VUS in ClinVar/ClinGen and to develop new guidelines for incorporating functional readouts into the ACMG criteria; 4. Inform the future development of novel therapeutics to treat epilepsy.

"Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are a cause of premature deaths, responsible for up to 8% of sudden deaths in industrialized countries.

We determined that up to 20% of TAAD patients without a known genetic syndrome have a family history of TAAD, which is inherited primarily in an autosomal dominant manner (termed heritable thoracic aortic disease, HTAD). We established a cohort of HTAD families (842 families with two or more members with TAAD) and used this cohort to identify novel HTAD genes. Positional cloning and candidate gene approaches by our lab and others have successfully identified 18 genes for HTAD. We hypothesize that there are multiple altered genes yet to be identified, disrupting known and novel molecular pathways responsible for thoracic aortic disease, and responsible for disease in the unsolved HTAD families. The overarching goal of the project is to identify the remaining genes for HTAD, characterize the phenotype associated with these novel genes, perform initial molecular studies linking the mutant gene to aortic disease, and rapidly translate these findings into improved clinical care and prevention of premature deaths due to aortic dissection in HTAD families. The proposed aims are: (1) Recruit and characterize additional HTAD families to be used to identify novel genes, and delineate the clinical features and mutation spectrum associated with new genes; (2) Pursue exome/genome sequencing on HTAD cases and use the genetic strategies to identify novel genes, including segregation of rare variants in affected relatives and trios (affected proband and unaffected parents) and burden analyses; (3) Pursue a machine-learning approach using exome data from HTAD families and controls to identify novel disease genes; (4) Perform initial molecular and cellular biology studies of novel HTAD genes to confirm a link between the mutant gene and thoracic aortic disease. In summary, we are uniquely poised to identify novel HTAD genes using our assembled cohort and are proposing both proven and novel strategies to identify additional HTAD genes. Uncovering HTAD genes is crucial for identifying individuals at risk for aortic dissections and initiating gene-specific clinical management to prevent premature death due to dissections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute aortic dissections are a common cause of premature death in the United States. The goal of the proposed research is to prevent premature deaths due to dissections by identifying individuals who are predisposed by uncovering all the genetic variants in the human genome that trigger dissection.",Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections,10053081,R01HL109942,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Survival', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dissection', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FBN1', 'FOXE3 gene', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'LOX gene', 'LTBP2 gene', 'Link', 'MADH4 gene', 'MYH11 gene', 'MYLK gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Medical', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Sudden Death', 'Surgical Management', 'Syndrome', 'TGFB2 gene', 'TGFBR1 gene', 'TGFBR2 gene', 'Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'family management', 'gene discovery', 'genetic approach', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'positional cloning', 'premature', 'prevent', 'proband', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'segregation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,653552,0.0157052326979838
"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of our project is to accelerate the discovery of DNA variation relevant to health and disease by analyzing data from over 225,000 ethnically and racially diverse patients that will undergo genome sequencing. Of particular importance is ensuring we have powerful statistical methods for analyzing data from underserved groups including U.S. minority populations.

"Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks Abstract Accurately detecting structural variation in the genome is a challenging task. Many approaches have been developed over the last few decades, yet it is estimated that tens of thousands of variants are still being missed in a given sample. Many of these variants are missed due to the limitations of using short-read sequencing to identify large variants. Although many of these missed variants are located within complex regions of the genome, it has been shown that some still have clinical relevance making their discovery important. New platforms have been developed for sequencing the genome using long-reads and show promise for overcoming many of these limitations creating the ability to identify the full spectrum of simple and complex structural variants. Because this technology is relatively young, new computational approaches to support the analysis of long-read sequencing data can aid in the discovery of these variants which are still being missed. In addition to detecting novel variation in samples with long-read sequencing data, computational approaches can be developed to leverage these novel variant calls to reanalyze the hundreds of thousands of short-read datasets currently available. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational approaches to identify novel structural variation in the genome. In Aim 1, we will apply a recurrence approach to analyze long read sequencing datasets utilizing deep neural networks. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool to derive profiles of structural variants predicted in long- reads which can be used to identify and genotype structural variants calls in short read data-sets. Together, these approaches will allow researchers to accurately characterize structural variation in both long and short- read datasets. Narrative Structural variation has been implicated in numerous human diseases but there are still tens of thousands of variants being overlooked in the genome. The proposed research aims to detect novel variation by developing new computational tools to analyze data generated by state-of-the-art sequencing methods. These tools will aid in the discovery of variants associated with human health.",Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks,9911983,F31HG010569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Label', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'variant detection']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2020,37657,0.034183489697898424
"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients.

"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance Reduced insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance (IR) is a forerunner of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Differences in the prevalence of IR among ethnic groups suggest its genetic etiology. However, recent studies implementing genetic association approaches were only nominally successful in defining the genetically-regulated molecular and cellular mechanisms of IR. Our physiologic and genomic studies suggest that (a) IR results from derangement in expression of thousands of genes in tissues involved in glucose homeostasis, and (b) genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), determine the expression level of a subset of IR-associated genes. Thus, transcript levels are key molecular phenotypes associated with IR and are proximal to the action of genetic variants. A subset of genetically-regulated transcript subnetworks that operate within the large highly interconnected global expression networks in disease-relevant tissues can cause IR, but remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that, regulatory SNPs in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) determine transcript levels of key driver genes, configure the expression subnetworks in adipose and muscle tissue, and are causal determinants for IR. The genetic architecture of eQTLs determines the heterogeneity in causal mechanisms of IR. Our preliminary data support the concept of causal genetic regulators of subnetworks in modulating insulin sensitivity. Challenging the current paradigms, our Aim 1 is to implement our cutting-edge Multiscale Network Modelling Approach to integrate measures of glucose homeostasis (SI and Matsuda index from FSIVGT and OGTT, respectively); adipose and muscle tissue transcript profiles; eSNP data from African American participants in the AAGMEx cohort (N=260); and genetic and epigenetic regulation data from knowledge bases to discover subnetworks and genetic drivers that are causally linked to IR. In Aim 2, we will validate insulin sensitivity-associated genetically-regulated subnetworks, and determine common and ethnically-predominant genetic regulatory mechanisms of IR, using multi-omics data from similarly phenotyped European ancestry individuals from the METSIM (N=770) and AREA (N=99) cohorts. These results will be compared with those from the AAGMEx cohort. Key driver genes of insulin sensitivity-associated genetically regulated adipose and muscle tissue subnetworks from Aims 1-2 will then be prioritized based on statistical ranking to validate their regulatory roles. In Aim 3, we will focus on understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms modulated by 10 selected putative key regulatory genes. Using in vitro genetic perturbation experiments in relevant human cell models we have already established, we will modulate the expression of these genes, identify target pathways, and examine IR-determining cellular mechanisms (e.g. metabolism, signal transduction, differentiation, inflammation, cell-cell interaction) regulated by these genes. Our study will be among the first to define the genetic regulatory networks of IR, a key step towards development of novel therapeutic options for prevention of IR and subsequent T2D. Deciphering the underlying molecular defects and genetic regulatory mechanisms of insulin sensitivity is an unmet need to develop novel and safe therapeutic options to prevent insulin resistance and progression to type 2 diabetes and other diseases of major public health importance. Building on our success in recruiting cohorts of metabolically well-characterized and molecularly profiled non-diabetic African and European Ancestry individuals, and creating a data resource that is suitably powered to conduct integrative multi-omics analysis, we will implement a novel computational approach to discover fat and muscle tissue gene regulatory networks and driver genes that are causally linked to insulin resistance. Leveraging expertise of our multidisciplinary research team in cell and molecular biological studies this project will define mechanistic roles for the computationally predicted key regulatory genes in determining insulin resistance and thus help inform new strategies to treat and even prevent the rapidly growing public-health challenge of type 2 diabetes, particularly among African Americans.",Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance,9959404,R01DK118243,"['Adipose tissue', 'African', 'African American', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Muscle', 'Network-based', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'causal model', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'density', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic phenotype', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'small hairpin RNA', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,378487,0.015869907181258032
"Single cell atlas as a roadmap for interpreting human genetic variation in complex disease Project Summary Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci likely affecting human health. To translate these findings into therapeutic targets and disease treatments, we need to understand the cellular context and underlying biological mechanisms through which each disease associated variant disrupts function. Large scale, information rich datasets are being generated across multiple modalities including transcriptomics from single cell RNA-seq studies, traits and phenotypes from the UK Biobank and germline genetic variation from exome sequencing studies. Here, we propose to develop methods to integrate these amazing resources towards understanding the identifying biological and cellular mechanisms that are leading to disease. The objectives will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) Integrate population scale biological datasets including UK Biobank and single cell transcriptomics data to construct gene modules with the goal to recapitulate biological pathways. 2) Develop a statistical framework to measure mutational burden across each of the cell type specific gene modules. Together, this research proposal will increase the power in interpreting human genetic variation and help better understand the mechanism through which they act. These methods are being developed around an IBD dataset and will derive substantial molecular information about the mechanisms driving IBD. The lessons and methodological advances from this work will be directly applicable in many complex disease contexts. Project Narrative Genome wide association studies are highly successful identifying thousands of disease-associated loci but fall short at 1) pinpointing the biological mechanisms through which the variants effect disease and 2) capturing the effects of rare variants which may be having larger effect on disease outcomes. This research proposal details plans to integrate high-throughput single cell transcriptomics, population scale biobank datasets and exome sequencing from large disease cohorts to learn a prior on which genes are likely working together in which cell types and consequently improve the statistical power in interpreting rare human genetic variation.

"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",9867736,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,607933,0.02539951979205587
"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,9982627,RM1HG009034,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All of Us Research Program', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'CCL4 gene', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Conceptions', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Protection', 'Data Security', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'European Union', 'Family', 'Film', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Identity', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Privacy', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newspapers', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral economics', 'blockchain', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'data access', 'data privacy', 'data sharing', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genomic data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'legal implication', 'minimal risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'news', 'next generation', 'sex', 'social', 'social media']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2020,1112351,0.007919557635678401
"Investigating the clinical ontologies of loss-of-function and gain-of-function human gene variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal is for an MD/PhD student’s individual pre-doctoral fellowship application. Joseph Park, the applicant under consideration, proposes a research training plan with the long-term goal of developing into an independent physician-scientist studying the genetic mechanisms underlying cardiometabolic and other complex diseases using computational, experimental, and translational approaches. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully described the roles of common genetic variation on human diseases by analyzing large populations with shared disease traits, but the clinical ontologies of numerous genes remain incompletely described through these phenotype-based methodologies. Additionally, a fundamental problem of genetic association studies remains to be the difficulty of describing the functional consequences of disease- associated variants to their respective gene products (i.e. loss- vs. gain-of-function). The Penn Medicine Biobank, a healthcare system-based database of genotype, whole-exome sequencing, and electronic health record (EHR) data, allows for an unbiased, genotype-first approach to describing the relationships between dysfunctional genes and human disease traits captured in the clinical setting through phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). Through gene-burden PheWAS tests, the proposed study aims to characterize the clinical manifestations of disease caused by rare, loss-of-function mutations in each gene on a genome- wide scale. Our analyses will enable clinicians to more effectively identify genetic diseases among their patients in the clinical setting. Furthermore, in addition to our interrogation of loss-of-function mutations, our proposed project has the potential to define the roles of known gain-of-function mutations in human disease and identify novel gain-of-function variants relevant to disease, offering a direction for investigators to design follow-up experimental studies in the basic sciences as well as a platform promoting more efficient therapeutic discoveries. And importantly, while conducting the proposed study, Joseph will receive rigorous training in computational biology and statistical genetics during the funding period, promoting his maturation into a successful, independent physician-scientist thoroughly prepared for a clinical career involving the analysis of “omics” and “big data”. These goals will be accomplished through the extensive fellowship training plan jointly developed by him and his sponsor, Daniel Rader. Through the mentorship of numerous senior investigators, regular attendance at seminars, conferences, and other opportunities for presentation and interaction with renowned scientists at the University of Pennsylvania, and the collaborative research environment that the Rader laboratory and its physically surrounding organizations promote, Joseph is well-equipped to achieve his career goals through his guaranteed development during the proposed training. PROJECT NARRATIVE Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully described the roles of many human genes by analyzing large populations with shared traits, but these phenotype-based methodologies have incompletely described the clinical implications of numerous genes. I propose to address this knowledge gap by taking an unbiased, genotype-first approach to describing the relationships between dysfunctional genes and human disease traits through gene-burden phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), essentially intersecting data from our healthcare system-based biobank database comprised of genotype data, whole-exome sequencing, and electronic health records (EHR). In addition to capturing the disease implications of rare, loss-of-function mutations on a genome-wide scale, my proposed project has the potential to define the roles of known and novel gain-of-function mutations in human disease, offering a direction for follow-up functional studies as well as a platform for more efficient therapeutic discoveries.",Investigating the clinical ontologies of loss-of-function and gain-of-function human gene variants,9916631,F30HG010442,"['Address', 'African American', 'Animal Model', 'Authorization documentation', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Recontacts', 'Records', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'doctoral student', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'gain of function', 'gain of function mutation', 'gene discovery', 'gene product', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pre-doctoral', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational approach']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2020,50520,0.02212262474875962
"Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases screening ABSTRACT A simple method to comprehensively discover, characterize and identify structural variants arising from normal metabolic processes, as well as cell manipulations, would have great utility for gene editing, oncology, and rare disease research, among other applications. De Novo Directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH™) has been developed to efficiently screen thousands of cells for the presence of simple, complex, and heterogenous structural variants. In this project, Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, we propose K-Band™ dGH, an expanded dGH method. K-Band dGH is an in-situ hybridization method that utilizes high-density chromatid paints with bands of distinct spectra. A normal chromosome has a definitive pattern of bands, spectra and probe density. Structural variants are detected and identified via changes to the signal pattern. The proposed K-Band™ dGH method will provide the means for de novo discovery of balanced allelic translocations involving breakpoints at the same loci, inversions, and sister chromatid recombination and exchange events that are invisible to existing methods such as sequencing and aCGH. K-Band dGH will additionally characterize deletions, duplications, translocations, aneuploidy, polyploidy and more complex rearrangements. Structural variations cause a wide range of disorders, from rare diseases to cancers, and can be precise and definitive biomarkers. Also, because variations arise from the mis-repair of DNA double-strand breaks, unintended structural damage is an inevitable and potentially high-risk byproduct of genome editing. The potential of genome editing approaches such as CRISPR-Cas9 in the treatment of diseases is widely recognized and the realization of the promise of such therapeutic approaches will rely on accurate confirmation of the presence and absence of potentially risky structural variants. For these reasons, comprehensive detection and characterization of structural variations is a necessary step toward understanding, diagnosing and ultimately precisely treating genetic diseases. From a homogeneous or heterogenous population of cells, and in a single experiment, K-Band dGH will identify cells with a structurally normal phenotype, detect all classes of structural variants, and locate the breakpoints of all simple and complex structural variants in each cell. With a limit of detection below 5Kb, K-Band dGH is an ideal method for determining the outcomes of gene editing, discovering the causes of undiagnosed rare diseases, profiling genomic structural instability and variability, and discovering and validating previously unknown structural genetic drivers of disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern genomics, driven by the demands of personalized medicine, needs higher throughput, higher integrity, and improved resolution to enable the discovery of new disease drivers and in the development of safer gene therapies. Rapid, accurate, efficient characterization of structural variants and their associated risks is critical to the discovery of potential therapeutic avenues for undiagnosed and rare diseases, and to the development of engineered cellular therapies, including stem cells, CAR-T and other gene therapies leveraging gene-editing tools such as CRISPR. K-Band™ dGH, proposed in Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, will enable single-cell, single-experiment identification of clinically important structural variants that cannot be discovered or identified by NGS or other available methods with broad applicability in genome engineering R&D, target discovery and personalized therapy development.","Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases screening",10080433,R44HG011442,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR therapeutics', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Chromatids', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Color', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Double Strand Break Repair', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Hybridizations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polyploidy', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Radiation', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reciprocal Translocation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sister Chromatid', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'density', 'experimental study', 'fluorophore', 'gene therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genomic profiles', 'genotoxicity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'new therapeutic target', 'personalized medicine', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'screening', 'stem cells', 'structural genomics', 'technological innovation', 'therapeutic gene', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"KROMATID, INC.",R44,2020,1088162,0.07101843586223343
"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases. We will focus on the development of methods that are able to detect synergistic effects of multiple genetic variants regardless of whether they are rare of common in human populations.

"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",10116927,U01HG009086,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Government', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biobank', 'cost', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome sciences', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,864183,0.010138887094542224
"Novel Statistical methods for DNA Sequencing Data, and applications to Autism. Summary One of the major problems in human genetics is understanding the genetic causes underlying complex phenotypes, including neuropsychiatric traits such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Despite tremendous work over the past few decades, the underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood in most cases. Recent advances in high-throughput, massively parallel genomic technologies have revolutionized the field of human genetics and promise to lead to important scientific advances. Despite this progress in data generation, it remains very challenging to analyze and interpret these data. The main focus of this proposal is the development of powerful statistical methods for the integration of whole-genome sequencing data with rich functional genomics data with the goal to improve the discovery of genes involved in autism spectrum disorders. We propose to integrate data from many different sources, including epigenetic data from projects such as ENCODE, Roadmap, and PsychENCODE, eQTL data from the GTEx, PsychENCODE and CommonMind consortia, data from large scale databases of genetic variation such as ExAC and gnomAD, in order to predict functional effects of genetic variants in non-coding genetic regions in a tissue and cell type specific manner, and generate functional maps across large number of tissues and cell types in the human body that we can then use to identify novel associations with autism in whole-genome sequencing studies. The proposed functional predictions and functional maps will be broadly available in the popular ANNOVAR database. We further propose to use these functional predictions in the analysis of almost 20,000 whole genomes from three large whole genome sequencing studies for autism. We believe that the proposed research is very timely and has the potential to substantially improve the analysis of non-coding genetic variation, and hence provide new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying risk to autism, and more broadly to other neuropsychiatric diseases. Narrative Autism Spectrum Disorders are common diseases with major impact on public health. Although coding variation has been extensively studied for its role in affecting risk to autism, the analysis of non-coding variation poses tremendous challenges. The proposed statistical methods and their applications to nearly 20,000 whole genomes from three large autism whole genome sequencing studies will improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in autism with important implications for disease treatment strategies.","Novel Statistical methods for DNA Sequencing Data, and applications to Autism.",9923466,R01MH095797,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain region', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cell type', 'cingulate cortex', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'exome', 'frontal lobe', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'whole genome']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,446831,0.01493873644998256
"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,9928091,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Cell Death', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Deacetylation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HDAC7 histone deacetylase', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous body substance', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic platform', 'healthspan', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel strategies', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'programs', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,483750,0.031541113473875476
"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10032890,R01DK125562,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Base Sequence', 'Beds', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cleft Palate', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Mouse', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intracisternal A-Particle Elements', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Micronutrients', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrotransposon', 'Seminal', 'Supplementation', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'critical period', 'disorder risk', 'early pregnancy', 'embryo culture', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenetic variation', 'experimental study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolic phenotype', 'mother nutrition', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nonhuman primate', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'offspring', 'peripheral blood', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,500075,0.00035686468234493146
"Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Abnormalities in heart rate, cardiac conduction (PR and QRS) and repolarization (QT) measured on the ECG predispose to the clinically important cardiac arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) / sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examine the genomic basis of these ECG endophenotypes in order to deconstruct arrhythmias into more proximate traits and discrete components, allowing us to better understand underlying mechanisms, provide insight into arrhythmia generation, and help target development of novel therapies.  The molecular architecture of cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias is not fully understood, but likely involves genomic, epigenomic, and environmental influences. Over the past 10 years, we have identified numerous common loci associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias, yet these common variants account for only a portion of the heritability of electrophysiologic and arrhythmic phenotypes. The agnostic examination of genotype-phenotype associations employed in genome- wide association studies (GWAS) does not incorporate knowledge of functional genomic regions or important biologic relationships. Additionally, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms connecting mostly intergenic and intronic GWAS signals to phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that a systems biology approach integrating genetic sequence variation with omic data (epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) will uncover novel associations and elucidate biologic mechanisms associated with arrhythmia-related phenotypes. We further hypothesize that examining the simultaneous association between sequence variation and multiple cardiac electrophysiologic phenotypes will help uncover additional novel mechanisms associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias.  TOPMed's combination of rich phenotype data, with whole genome sequence (WGS), epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, provides a unique opportunity to more comprehensively explore these hypotheses. We leverage sequence, omic, and phenotype data from multiple cohort studies to efficiently and cost-effectively examine and dissect association of omic factors with cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia risk. Our application is an ambitious yet eminently feasible effort that integrates clinical, genetic, and systems biology expertise. We aim to discover associations using omics data (Aims 1 and 2) and elucidate specific genes and biologic pathways underlying these associations (Aims 3 and 4). Our ultimate goal is to identify pathways, genes, and genetic variation that are clinically relevant, and therefore potentially the target of new therapies, diagnostics, or risk predictions. Narrative Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This proposal aims to use genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, combined with complex systems biology and pleiotropic analyses, to better understand the underlying pathways and genes involved in normal electrophysiology and arrhythmia formation. The identification of biologic factors that influence cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias will provide insight into the mechanisms of arrhythmia generation, and perhaps identify better targets for drug development and prevention.",Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias.,9921462,R01HL141989,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'heart electrical activity', 'insight', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'rare variant', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,476969,0.01760169391310723

This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics. Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause.

"Integrate gene expression data to characterize the contribution of rare genetic risk factors to structural birth defects Project Summary  We aim to maximize discovery of new risk genes and elucidate the genetic architecture of structural birth defects. To achieve that, we propose cross-disease genetic analysis of both protein-coding and noncoding variants and integration of gene expression data to prioritize candidate risk genes.  Better understanding of the genetic basis of structural birth defects will lead to new insights into human developmental biology and will provide targets for medical intervention and treatment. Recent large-scale genome and exome sequencing studies of birth defects have identified new risk genes, especially through the analysis of de novo variants in protein coding regions. However, we are still far from complete understanding of the genetic causes of birth defects. Estimates are that there are 400- 800 risk genes of large effect size for birth defects such as congenital heart disease, and the vast majority of these genes are unknown. This is primarily due to the lack of statistical power. While increasing sample size is essential and is part of the core deliverables of the Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF) programs, we also need to develop and apply new analytical methods that improve power and maximize the utility of the available genetic data by using other types of data and biological knowledge. In addition, in most prior studies, the analysis of rare genetic variation has been focused on small variants in the coding regions or large copy number variants (CNV). The data and methods to interrogate the contribution of rare noncoding variants is rudimentary, limiting our understanding of genetic architecture of these diseases. In this study, we propose two aims to address these questions by leverage GMKF cross-disease whole genome sequencing data sets: Specific Aim 1. Elucidate genetic architecture by cross-disease analysis of rare coding and non-coding variants. Specific Aim 2. Integrate gene expression with genome sequencing data to improve discovery and biological interpretation of risk genes of structural birth defects.  The proposed study will maximize the genetic discovery potential of the GMKF WGS data sets for birth defects and improve our understanding of the pleiotropic effects and tissue specificity of risk genes and variants. The analytical approaches developed in this study will be applicable to genetic data of birth defects and developmental disorders from future GMKF cohorts and other programs. Project Narrative We propose to analyze whole genome sequencing data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First cohorts using new computational approaches that maximize the risk gene discovery and improve interpretation of candidate genes.

"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9989904,U01MH115727,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2020,4125261,0.026417542731804796
"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis,9951002,R01AR070139,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Differentiation and Growth', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Haplotypes', 'High Prevalence', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'cartilage cell', 'causal variant', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'spatiotemporal', 'whole genome']",NIAMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,597506,0.04684794729558352
"Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease Project Summary/ Abstract  Over the past decade there has been a rapid expansion of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as the development of large-scale consortia like the UKBioBank and the All of Us project. While the number of genetic associations to human traits and disease is soaring, tools to characterize and interpret these variants are lacking. One challenge to realizing the potential of genomics is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, regulatory sequences. However, ‘regulatory grammar’ – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with transcription factors to control gene expression, is poorly understood. A repertoire of well-characterized causal variants is needed to build generalizable models with which to unlock insights into the genetic basis of human health and history.  Natural selection is a powerful driver of human genetic variation. As our species has encountered new climates, dramatic alterations in diet, and novel pathogens, these selective pressures have left hundreds of signatures of adaptation in our genomes, reflected in our species’ diversity of disease risk and morphology. For selection to have acted positively on them, these adaptive alleles must exhibit relatively strong phenotypic effects, and they continue to contribute to modern traits and disease (e.g. height or sickle cell anemia). Salient examples of human adaptation include immunity, metabolism, and morphology, all of which have extensive, unresolved GWAS signals. This renders the lens of recent evolution a powerful, but underutilized, tool for identifying alleles that contribute to phenotypic variation in modern association studies.  This proposal aims to expand the repertoire of well-characterized GWAS signals, by A) using evolution to prioritize adaptive variants, and B) applying novel, high-throughput experimental and computational tools to comprehensively decipher the functions of regulatory variants. These approaches will identify much needed causal variants, devise paradigms for their study, and inform future predictive models to characterize them. During the mentored phase of the K99, I will first develop methods to colocalize signals of selection and GWAS, and then use Variant Effect Predictions (VEP) to predict their function. I will then employ high-through methods such as a the massively parallel reporter assay and CRISPR non-coding screen to functionally characterize them directly. From the adaptive GWAS alleles our screens identify, we will make in-vivo system to more deeply characterize them during the Independent R00 phase. During this time I will deploy a variety of genomic tools such as ChIP, ChIA-PET, and RNA-seq to understand the adaptive variants’ molecular etiology. I will use the empirical data fro these studies, and the MPRA/HCR-FlowFISH screens to build more accurate VEP models. ! Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to identify adaptive human alleles underlying genome wide association studies and comprehensively characterize them using novel computational and experimental tools. I will then make in-vivo models of these to test their function and effects on fitness, improving future predictions of how genetic variants impact human evolution and health.",Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease,10005404,K99HG010669,"['African', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'CCRL2 gene', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Climate', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Height', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Immunity', 'Lassa Fever', 'Left', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Selections', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic tools', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'lens', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2020,125378,0.049647699349312735
"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.",IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset,10001511,U01DK062431,"['ATAC-seq', 'Admixture', 'African', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asians', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Charge', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancers', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Financial Hardship', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Human Characteristics', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive measure', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'differential expression', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macrophage', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'racial disparity', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'study population', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'two-dimensional', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,U01,2020,451377,0.043385787597536085
