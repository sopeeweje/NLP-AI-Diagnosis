"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9693300,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EEG-based imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'automated analysis', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,676659,0.06156640490863289
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9619075,R01DC014498,"['Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,318386,0.1357591541501493
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9701324,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,613809,0.061162353627011896
"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience. By further identifying possible interventions that target this vulnerability, this work seeks to decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms.",Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome,9769513,F31HL140943,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alexithymias', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Anger', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Common Core', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'alcohol risk', 'allostasis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'graph theory', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,38616,0.07800478866785739
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9652845,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'social deficits', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,474391,0.11562546160517956
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9675331,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,569073,0.13235232654940018
"Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues. People signal their internal emotional state by a range of cues including facial expressions, non-verbal vocalizations and the tone and content of speech. Much work to date on emotional signaling has focused on a small number of emotions and has relied on stimulus sets with limited numbers of exemplars and poor representation of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The computer vision literature has long recognized the need to be able to compare models, for example of face recognition, across complex, diverse, and naturalistic stimulus sets. Here, we argue that a parallel approach needs to be applied if we are to achieve a robust and generalizable understanding of how the human brain represents emotion and identity related information derived from facial and vocal cues. Three multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments are proposed. In the first, participants will view a large corpus (~2000) of faces of individuals varying in age, gender and ethnicity and showing a wide range of emotional expressions. In the second, participants will be presented with a large (~1000) and equally diverse set of emotional vocalizations. The third experiment will make use of an even more complex and naturalistic stimulus set comprising ~1000 video clips of individuals expressing emotions through facial expression, non-verbal vocalizations and emotion-laden speech. This set will be broken into three parts, with as closely matched content as possible. These will be presented to participants in audio only, visual only and audio-visual (bimodal) conditions, with the stimuli allocated to each condition balanced across participants. For each experiment, data collection will comprise separate Model Estimation and Model Validation periods with the majority of stimuli presented at Validation being distinct from those presented at Estimation. A range of models will be fit to the fMRI data acquired during Estimation runs and tested and compared using data acquired during Validation runs. These models contain sets of features that describe the emotional content of the stimuli presented in terms of either dimensional or categorical models of emotion. By comparing the fit of these models we can determine which models capture most variance in voxel response profiles and examine how this varies across brain regions. Across the three experiments, we also seek to establish whether there are regions where voxels show common coding of emotional state regardless of whether information is carried by facial or vocal cues or a combination of both. Further, by contrasting models with and without terms for characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity we can also investigate the (in)dependence of the representation of emotion and identity-related features. The proposed research has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of how cues to others' emotional state are represented in the human brain and the extent to which this is influenced by the characteristics of the person we are interacting with. In the medium term, we plan to extend this to also model listener/ viewer characteristics (both demographics and predisposition to anxiety or depression) in a hope to advance our understanding of how biases in the interpretation of emotional signals can arise. Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial  and vocal cues. Individuals with psychiatric conditions ranging from Social Anxiety and Depression to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia struggle to correctly interpret others' emotional states. To understand how alterations in brain function can give rise to the misperception of emotion cues, we first need better normative models of how information about others' emotional state derived from facial and vocal cues is represented within the human brain. Hence, here we use large, diverse and naturalistic stimulus sets encompassing facial expressions, emotional vocalizations and multi-modal videos to investigate the extent to which consistent representation of emotional state is observed across stimulus modalities, and to explore the organizational principles that can best explain voxel response profiles or tuning patterns to facial and vocal emotion cues.",Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues,9731295,R01MH112541,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Research', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'information model', 'multimodality', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social anxiety', 'theories', 'trait', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,125000,0.19439056987427913
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9481191,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EEG-based imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,616434,0.06156640490863289
"Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years Project Summary Significance. Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Children with CFM have elevated levels of internalizing behavior (shy, withdrawn) and reduced social competence and peer acceptance. Unknown at present are the mechanisms through which CFM and these social-emotional outcomes become linked. Facial asymmetries and cranial neuropathies associated with CFM likely play an important role in impairing socio-emotional outcomes. Asymmetries of the facial skeleton, soft tissue, and cranial nerve have both intra- and interpersonal effects. Intra-personally, they impact function (unilateral hearing loss, malocclusion, facial expressiveness) and form (noticeable craniofacial malformations), which can impair social signaling and responsiveness. Because asymmetry is negatively correlated with attractiveness, there may be non-specific social effects as well. Many surgical treatments for CFM are designed to restore facial symmetry in static pose (e.g., neutral expression). Less is known about restoring or even measuring spontaneous facial expressiveness. From a developmental perspective, one of the most important consequences of limitations in facial muscle movement is its potentially negative impact on affective communication. In a longitudinal design, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry increase risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, the findings would inform our understanding of socio-emotional development in children with CFM and contribute to clinical evaluation and treatment. Innovation. This is the first effort to 1) use automated, objective measurement of facial expressiveness of communicative behavior and functional asymmetry of children with CFM; 2) model change with development in these parameters and their relation to internalizing and externalizing problems; and 3) use machine learning to investigate the relation among dynamics of expressiveness and asymmetry in relation to CBCL. Approach. Children with and without CFM will be video-recorded at 1 and 3 years with an examiner. Age 1 is an interactive context intended to elicit positive and negative emotion. Age 3 is an interactive context to assess expressive speech and attention. Expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry are assessed using automatic, objective computer-vision based measurement. Analyses include complementary approaches: statistical (regression and ANOVA) hypothesis testing and machine learning (convolutional neural networks). Relevance Using objective, automatic computer-vision-based measurements, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry among children with CFM increases their risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, clinical assessments of expressiveness and functional asymmetry could effectively target children for specialized interventions and be used to evaluate surgical interventions. Because the proposed procedures are cost effective, they could be applied in a wide range of settings to benefit children with craniofacial disorders and have applicability to other conditions and age groups in which facial expression is compromised (e.g., Mobius Syndrome, Bell's Palsy, injury/burns, and stroke). Project Narrative Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is among the most common craniofacial anomalies. CFM impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development.

"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9402599,R01DC014498,"['Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,318898,0.1357591541501493
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9534747,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,663541,0.061162353627011896
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,9442821,R33MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'participant retention', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R33,2018,237842,0.05500606075847072
"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience. By further identifying possible interventions that target this vulnerability, this work seeks to decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms.",Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome,9470193,F31HL140943,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alexithymias', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Anger', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Common Core', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'alcohol risk', 'allostasis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'graph theory', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,38124,0.07800478866785739
"Emotion Processing, Cognition and Functioning in Comorbid Psychosis Spectrum and Cocaine Use Disorders NIDA's strategic planning emphasizes the need to increase the real-world relevance of research by prioritizing “research that incorporates real-world complexities including common comorbidities” that “interact to affect symptom profiles, illness trajectory, and treatment outcomes”.  The overall goal of the current application is to characterize the impact of the common comorbidity between psychosis spectrum disorders (PSD, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder) and cocaine use disorders (CUD) on cognition, emotion processing and functional outcomes. Clinical and sociodemographic correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD, and pathways to functional outcomes in comorbid PSD+CUD will also be explored.  To do this, three existing datasets will be used, with comprehensive diagnostic, clinical, cognitive and functional data, including patients with comorbid PSD and CUD (PSD+CUD), and 3 comparison groups: patients with PSD without CUD, patients with CUD without PSD, and healthy controls without psychiatric disorder. This unique design, including all 3 relevant control groups, will allow to elucidate the combined effect of comorbid PSD+CUD, compared to the effect of PSD or CUD alone, on cognition and emotion processing, and test two alternate models: an additive model and a self- medication model. The present study will focus on 3 specific aims: 1) To characterize sociodemographic and clinical correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD; 2) To characterize cognitive and emotion processing impairments in comorbid PSD+CUD; 3) To characterize functional impairments in comorbid PSD+CUD, and to identify predictors and pathways to social functioning. ANOVAs and Chi- square tests will be used to compare the groups on sociodemographic features, clinical features, cognitive and emotion processing performance and functional outcomes. Linear and logistic regressions, structural equation modeling and machine learning will be used to identify predictors and model pathways to functional outcomes, taking into account possible mediators.  Data from this study will increase our understanding of the impact of comorbid PSD+CUD on cognition, emotion processing and pathways to functional outcomes. We will also characterize the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD. This will allow to identify those at risk for comorbid PSD+CUD, and to tailor personalized prevention and intervention approaches, targeting specific factors identified in the models. For example, cognitive and emotion processing impairments are modifiable through cognitive/emotion processing remediation strategies. The overall goal of the current application is to examine the impact of the common comorbidity of psychosis spectrum disorders (PSD) and cocaine use disorders (CUD) on cognition, emotion processing and social functioning. We will also characterize the clinical and sociodemographic correlates of PSD+CUD and explore predictors and pathways to functional outcomes. Understanding the clinical and sociodemographic correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD, and the factors that underlie functional outcomes, will allow to identify those at risk and tailor personalized prevention and intervention approaches.","Emotion Processing, Cognition and Functioning in Comorbid Psychosis Spectrum and Cocaine Use Disorders",9599895,R03DA045094,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cannabis', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Control Groups', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Medication', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'cocaine use', 'comparison group', 'design', 'early onset', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'interest', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'remediation', 'research study', 'sex']",NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R03,2018,127125,0.09079832707893365
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9487048,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,474391,0.11562546160517956
"Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning PROJECT SUMMARY This R01 renewal application proposes functional neuroimaging studies with human subjects to elucidate the role of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in the processing of facial identities and expressions that predict critical social outcomes. Presentations of facial expressions of emotion in neuroimaging studies have proven particularly robust stimuli for activating amygdala and prefrontal regions involved in processing biologically- relevant social cues. Here we propose to further develop our novel structural and functional neuroimaging methods to better understand how the amygdala interacts with reciprocally connected prefrontal areas when such expressions are encountered. Specifically, following up on our previous findings that the structural integrity of an amygdala-prefrontal pathway predicts individual differences in reported anxiety – we replicated this effect in > 250 subjects and observed an exciting sex difference; this effect is compellingly stronger in females than in males. Here we propose to follow up on this effect with higher resolution DTI methods and to extend it to functional resting state data to see if the same sex difference is observed functionally. In addition, we propose a new mathematical model where we believe we can disentangle the effects of valence from arousal in brain imaging data, a confound the field continues to struggle with. Finally, we propose the development of a new facial expression stimulus set where we record the psychological status of the models posing for the expressions so we can determine any interaction this might have with the psychological status of the our subjects of study. The field can then usefully compare these data to complementary developmental research (i.e., with children and adolescents) and will be amenable  to direct translation to clinical populations (e.g., anxiety and depression). The experiments proposed here will increase our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in  this learning. A number of experiments highlight an important difference between men and women that  we discovered during our last grant and follow up on here. Specifically, brain connections with the  prefrontal cortex in females explain how anxious they report being but we do not see this effect in  males. With this information, we can then better understand what goes wrong in the brains of  individuals with major depression and anxiety disorders.",Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning,9561940,R56MH080716,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Friends', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Same-sex', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social learning', 'social situation', 'two-dimensional', 'white matter']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R56,2018,405000,0.053901426082261096
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9523855,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,594230,0.13235232654940018
"Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues. People signal their internal emotional state by a range of cues including facial expressions, non-verbal vocalizations and the tone and content of speech. Much work to date on emotional signaling has focused on a small number of emotions and has relied on stimulus sets with limited numbers of exemplars and poor representation of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The computer vision literature has long recognized the need to be able to compare models, for example of face recognition, across complex, diverse, and naturalistic stimulus sets. Here, we argue that a parallel approach needs to be applied if we are to achieve a robust and generalizable understanding of how the human brain represents emotion and identity related information derived from facial and vocal cues. Three multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments are proposed. In the first, participants will view a large corpus (~2000) of faces of individuals varying in age, gender and ethnicity and showing a wide range of emotional expressions. In the second, participants will be presented with a large (~1000) and equally diverse set of emotional vocalizations. The third experiment will make use of an even more complex and naturalistic stimulus set comprising ~1000 video clips of individuals expressing emotions through facial expression, non-verbal vocalizations and emotion-laden speech. This set will be broken into three parts, with as closely matched content as possible. These will be presented to participants in audio only, visual only and audio-visual (bimodal) conditions, with the stimuli allocated to each condition balanced across participants. For each experiment, data collection will comprise separate Model Estimation and Model Validation periods with the majority of stimuli presented at Validation being distinct from those presented at Estimation. A range of models will be fit to the fMRI data acquired during Estimation runs and tested and compared using data acquired during Validation runs. These models contain sets of features that describe the emotional content of the stimuli presented in terms of either dimensional or categorical models of emotion. By comparing the fit of these models we can determine which models capture most variance in voxel response profiles and examine how this varies across brain regions. Across the three experiments, we also seek to establish whether there are regions where voxels show common coding of emotional state regardless of whether information is carried by facial or vocal cues or a combination of both. Further, by contrasting models with and without terms for characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity we can also investigate the (in)dependence of the representation of emotion and identity-related features. The proposed research has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of how cues to others' emotional state are represented in the human brain and the extent to which this is influenced by the characteristics of the person we are interacting with. In the medium term, we plan to extend this to also model listener/ viewer characteristics (both demographics and predisposition to anxiety or depression) in a hope to advance our understanding of how biases in the interpretation of emotional signals can arise. Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial  and vocal cues. Individuals with psychiatric conditions ranging from Social Anxiety and Depression to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia struggle to correctly interpret others' emotional states. To understand how alterations in brain function can give rise to the misperception of emotion cues, we first need better normative models of how information about others' emotional state derived from facial and vocal cues is represented within the human brain. Hence, here we use large, diverse and naturalistic stimulus sets encompassing facial expressions, emotional vocalizations and multi-modal videos to investigate the extent to which consistent representation of emotional state is observed across stimulus modalities, and to explore the organizational principles that can best explain voxel response profiles or tuning patterns to facial and vocal emotion cues.",Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues,9545868,R01MH112541,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Research', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'information model', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social anxiety', 'theories', 'trait', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,125000,0.19439056987427913
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9331744,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EEG-based imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,193734,0.06156640490863289
"Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years Project Summary Significance. Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Children with CFM have elevated levels of internalizing behavior (shy, withdrawn) and reduced social competence and peer acceptance. Unknown at present are the mechanisms through which CFM and these social-emotional outcomes become linked. Facial asymmetries and cranial neuropathies associated with CFM likely play an important role in impairing socio-emotional outcomes. Asymmetries of the facial skeleton, soft tissue, and cranial nerve have both intra- and interpersonal effects. Intra-personally, they impact function (unilateral hearing loss, malocclusion, facial expressiveness) and form (noticeable craniofacial malformations), which can impair social signaling and responsiveness. Because asymmetry is negatively correlated with attractiveness, there may be non-specific social effects as well. Many surgical treatments for CFM are designed to restore facial symmetry in static pose (e.g., neutral expression). Less is known about restoring or even measuring spontaneous facial expressiveness. From a developmental perspective, one of the most important consequences of limitations in facial muscle movement is its potentially negative impact on affective communication. In a longitudinal design, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry increase risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, the findings would inform our understanding of socio-emotional development in children with CFM and contribute to clinical evaluation and treatment. Innovation. This is the first effort to 1) use automated, objective measurement of facial expressiveness of communicative behavior and functional asymmetry of children with CFM; 2) model change with development in these parameters and their relation to internalizing and externalizing problems; and 3) use machine learning to investigate the relation among dynamics of expressiveness and asymmetry in relation to CBCL. Approach. Children with and without CFM will be video-recorded at 1 and 3 years with an examiner. Age 1 is an interactive context intended to elicit positive and negative emotion. Age 3 is an interactive context to assess expressive speech and attention. Expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry are assessed using automatic, objective computer-vision based measurement. Analyses include complementary approaches: statistical (regression and ANOVA) hypothesis testing and machine learning (convolutional neural networks). Relevance Using objective, automatic computer-vision-based measurements, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry among children with CFM increases their risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, clinical assessments of expressiveness and functional asymmetry could effectively target children for specialized interventions and be used to evaluate surgical interventions. Because the proposed procedures are cost effective, they could be applied in a wide range of settings to benefit children with craniofacial disorders and have applicability to other conditions and age groups in which facial expression is compromised (e.g., Mobius Syndrome, Bell's Palsy, injury/burns, and stroke). Project Narrative Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is among the most common craniofacial anomalies. CFM impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Using computer-vision based face analysis, statistical analysis (regression and ANOVA), and machine learning, we will investigate the relation among expressiveness, structural and functional asymmetry, and behavior problems in children with CFM.",Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years,9387016,R03DE026513,"['1 year old', '3 year old', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Articulation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bell Palsy', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Burn injury', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Cranial nerve diseases', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Facial asymmetry', 'Funding', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malocclusion', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mobius Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Problem behavior', 'Procedures', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unilateral Hearing Loss', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cost effective', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial microsomia', 'design', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'malformation', 'outcome prediction', 'parent grant', 'peer', 'research clinical testing', 'social', 'social skills', 'soft tissue']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2017,168654,0.13539987658586758
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9199411,R01DC014498,"['Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Study', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,319382,0.1357591541501493
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9383530,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,666777,0.061162353627011896
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,9232220,R33MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R33,2017,259157,0.05500606075847072
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9286515,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,505201,0.11562546160517956
"A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of patients suffering from craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities and requiring surgical correction is escalating. CMF deformities may involve skeleton, overlying soft-tissues, or the both. Patients with CMF deformities often have psychological problems. The goal of CMF surgery is to reconstruct a normal facial appearance and function, and the outcome of the surgery is judged as such. The current problem is that we do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change following skeletal reconstruction. In treating patients with isolated skeletal defects, the current practice is to normalize the skeleton, hoping for optimal facial appearance. However, because the thickness and contour of the soft-tissue envelope varies from patient to patient, this approach is not reliable. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, in the scenario of a patient with a skeletal deformity and a mild soft-tissue defect, a surgeon would have to know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But, this information can only be attained by having an accurate planning system to simulate soft-tissue changes. In addition, from patient's perspective, the final facial appearance is the most apparent to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-deformation.  Simulation methods must be accurate and fast. Attaining both is difficult because these attributes are inversely related, the more accurate the model, the longer it takes to prepare and run. Among the most effective, they are empirical-based model, mass spring model, finite element model, and mass tensor model. Unfortunately they are either too inaccurate or too slow, and clinically unacceptable.  Our hypothesis is that facial soft-tissue changes following virtual osteotomy can be accurately simulated by our innovative approach using an anatomically detailed modeling and mapping routine, along with statistical modeling technique. To test our hypothesis, we propose to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual osteotomies, and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction. This approach can not only maintain the integrity of complex facial anatomy to accurately simulate the facial soft tissue deformation, but also significantly improve the computational efficiency in order to fit the requirement for clinical use  This project presents an innovative approach to model the facial soft-tissue deformation. If successful, it will allow accurate simulation of soft-tissue changes after virtual osteotomy. Patients will also be able to foresee the postoperative face preoperatively (patient education) and regain their psychological confidence. Finally, eFace will have significant impact and applications in orthodontics, plastic surgery, general surgery, growth/aging prediction, and forensic science. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring surgical correction for facial deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissu, or both, is escalating every year. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan bone reconstructive surgery, they have to use  their visual imagination with clinical experience to mentally predict the facial soft tissue changes  following the bone surgery because they do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change  that is resulted from skeletal reconstruction. 3.

"Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning PROJECT SUMMARY This R01 renewal application proposes functional neuroimaging studies with human subjects to elucidate the role of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in the processing of facial identities and expressions that predict critical social outcomes. Presentations of facial expressions of emotion in neuroimaging studies have proven particularly robust stimuli for activating amygdala and prefrontal regions involved in processing biologically- relevant social cues. Here we propose to further develop our novel structural and functional neuroimaging methods to better understand how the amygdala interacts with reciprocally connected prefrontal areas when such expressions are encountered. Specifically, following up on our previous findings that the structural integrity of an amygdala-prefrontal pathway predicts individual differences in reported anxiety – we replicated this effect in > 250 subjects and observed an exciting sex difference; this effect is compellingly stronger in females than in males. Here we propose to follow up on this effect with higher resolution DTI methods and to extend it to functional resting state data to see if the same sex difference is observed functionally. In addition, we propose a new mathematical model where we believe we can disentangle the effects of valence from arousal in brain imaging data, a confound the field continues to struggle with. Finally, we propose the development of a new facial expression stimulus set where we record the psychological status of the models posing for the expressions so we can determine any interaction this might have with the psychological status of the our subjects of study. The field can then usefully compare these data to complementary developmental research (i.e., with children and adolescents) and will be amenable  to direct translation to clinical populations (e.g., anxiety and depression). The experiments proposed here will increase our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in  this learning. A number of experiments highlight an important difference between men and women that  we discovered during our last grant and follow up on here. Specifically, brain connections with the  prefrontal cortex in females explain how anxious they report being but we do not see this effect in  males. With this information, we can then better understand what goes wrong in the brains of  individuals with major depression and anxiety disorders.",Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning,9499980,R56MH080716,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Friends', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Same-sex', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social learning', 'social situation', 'two-dimensional', 'white matter']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R56,2017,405000,0.053901426082261096
"Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues. People signal their internal emotional state by a range of cues including facial expressions, non-verbal vocalizations and the tone and content of speech. Much work to date on emotional signaling has focused on a small number of emotions and has relied on stimulus sets with limited numbers of exemplars and poor representation of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The computer vision literature has long recognized the need to be able to compare models, for example of face recognition, across complex, diverse, and naturalistic stimulus sets. Here, we argue that a parallel approach needs to be applied if we are to achieve a robust and generalizable understanding of how the human brain represents emotion and identity related information derived from facial and vocal cues. Three multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments are proposed. In the first, participants will view a large corpus (~2000) of faces of individuals varying in age, gender and ethnicity and showing a wide range of emotional expressions. In the second, participants will be presented with a large (~1000) and equally diverse set of emotional vocalizations. The third experiment will make use of an even more complex and naturalistic stimulus set comprising ~1000 video clips of individuals expressing emotions through facial expression, non-verbal vocalizations and emotion-laden speech. This set will be broken into three parts, with as closely matched content as possible. These will be presented to participants in audio only, visual only and audio-visual (bimodal) conditions, with the stimuli allocated to each condition balanced across participants. For each experiment, data collection will comprise separate Model Estimation and Model Validation periods with the majority of stimuli presented at Validation being distinct from those presented at Estimation. A range of models will be fit to the fMRI data acquired during Estimation runs and tested and compared using data acquired during Validation runs. These models contain sets of features that describe the emotional content of the stimuli presented in terms of either dimensional or categorical models of emotion. By comparing the fit of these models we can determine which models capture most variance in voxel response profiles and examine how this varies across brain regions. Across the three experiments, we also seek to establish whether there are regions where voxels show common coding of emotional state regardless of whether information is carried by facial or vocal cues or a combination of both. Further, by contrasting models with and without terms for characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity we can also investigate the (in)dependence of the representation of emotion and identity-related features. The proposed research has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of how cues to others' emotional state are represented in the human brain and the extent to which this is influenced by the characteristics of the person we are interacting with. In the medium term, we plan to extend this to also model listener/ viewer characteristics (both demographics and predisposition to anxiety or depression) in a hope to advance our understanding of how biases in the interpretation of emotional signals can arise. Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial  and vocal cues. Individuals with psychiatric conditions ranging from Social Anxiety and Depression to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia struggle to correctly interpret others' emotional states. To understand how alterations in brain function can give rise to the misperception of emotion cues, we first need better normative models of how information about others' emotional state derived from facial and vocal cues is represented within the human brain. Hence, here we use large, diverse and naturalistic stimulus sets encompassing facial expressions, emotional vocalizations and multi-modal videos to investigate the extent to which consistent representation of emotional state is observed across stimulus modalities, and to explore the organizational principles that can best explain voxel response profiles or tuning patterns to facial and vocal emotion cues.",Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues,9285649,R01MH112541,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Research', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'information model', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social anxiety', 'theories', 'trait', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,125000,0.19439056987427913
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9176279,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2016,574983,0.06156640490863289
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use. The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.",Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use,9029353,R01MH096951,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Gender', 'Generic Drugs', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'positive emotional state', 'skin color', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,452541,0.22757670437144356
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.            ",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9054574,R01DC014498,"['Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Study', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,331310,0.1357591541501493
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,9131476,R33MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R33,2016,346148,0.05500606075847072
"Automated assessment using facial coding Abstract  Transition-age youth (TAY) from ages 18-26 are especially vulnerable to substance use, misuse, and substance use disorder (SUD). This developmental period, termed the “age of instability"" and ""emerging adulthood"" includes tasks such as leaving home, entering college; identifying vocational goals; working for the first time; body and sexuality changes; coalescing with a peer group; and for some, aging out of foster care or state custody, which end at age 18. The emerging- adulthood period is prime for experimentation with substances and the development of SUD, and associated problems such as binge drinking, driving under the influence, accidents, fighting and violence, HIV, gang involvement, suicide and self-harm, and vulnerability to date-rape and other sexual assault. A major challenge for TAY is the capacity to regulate their emotions, given the hormone changes and emotional intensity of this stage of life. Indeed, substance use is often described as a short-term way to regulate emotion and there is a long-standing literature documenting the association between emotion regulation (ER) problems and SUD. The importance of ER is also grounded in the developmental literature in which ER is identified as a core skill that is critical to the successful transition to adulthood. The initial component of ER, accurate identification of emotion, is itself a major challenge, especially for people with SUD as they are often not aware of their feelings or confused about them due to the nature of the disorder as well as mental health disorders that often co-occur with SUD.  In this phase 1 proposal we describe the development of a mobile app that uses exciting new technology (automated facial coding) to help TAY better recognize their emotions in relation to SUD variables. We describe the use of front-end focus groups to provide pre-development input on the app; we detail the app features and user experience; and define the app’s technical specifications. Phase 1 also includes a pilot feasibility study of the prototype product among TAY with SUD. They will have four weeks to use the app in their natural environment, such as home, and we will conduct pre- and post-evaluation using validated instruments to characterize the sample, quantity satisfaction and feasibility, evaluate emotion- and substance-related variables, as well as explore the app metrics and its technical performance. If positive results are found this would set us up well for phase 2, which could expand the app in some really interesting directions as well as further study it in a randomized controlled trial. The app product we envision would have major public health and clinical impact. It could help improve TAY’s ability to become more aware of their emotions and understand them in relation to SUD via an exciting emotion-focused technology innovation. If the product is successful it could also be expanded to other populations. Our stellar team includes experts in SUD, TAY, clinical innovations, technology, and app development. Narrative We propose to help young adults (ages 18-26) who have substance abuse problems. Our goal is to help them learn more about their emotions in relation to their substance abuse as a way to ultimately help them reduce their substance use. We plan to use a sophisticated technology related to emotion recognition, and to use that to help support the young adults in learning more about managing their emotions. Our work will include the development of a mobile app related to these goals.",Automated assessment using facial coding,9199791,R43DA042640,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anger', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Forcible intercourse', 'Goals', 'Guns', 'HIV', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Nature', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Peer Group', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sales', 'Sampling', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sexuality', 'Smiling', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'cloud based', 'college', 'craving', 'driving under influence', 'emerging adulthood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fighting', 'foster care', 'gang', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'killings', 'lens', 'literacy', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'prototype', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'visual stimulus', 'young adult']",NIDA,"TREATMENT INNOVATIONS, LLC",R43,2016,225000,0.0828566482130044
"A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of patients suffering from craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities and requiring surgical correction is escalating. CMF deformities may involve skeleton, overlying soft-tissues, or the both. Patients with CMF deformities often have psychological problems. The goal of CMF surgery is to reconstruct a normal facial appearance and function, and the outcome of the surgery is judged as such. The current problem is that we do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change following skeletal reconstruction. In treating patients with isolated skeletal defects, the current practice is to normalize the skeleton, hoping for optimal facial appearance. However, because the thickness and contour of the soft-tissue envelope varies from patient to patient, this approach is not reliable. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, in the scenario of a patient with a skeletal deformity and a mild soft-tissue defect, a surgeon would have to know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But, this information can only be attained by having an accurate planning system to simulate soft-tissue changes. In addition, from patient's perspective, the final facial appearance is the most apparent to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-deformation.  Simulation methods must be accurate and fast. Attaining both is difficult because these attributes are inversely related, the more accurate the model, the longer it takes to prepare and run. Among the most effective, they are empirical-based model, mass spring model, finite element model, and mass tensor model. Unfortunately they are either too inaccurate or too slow, and clinically unacceptable.  Our hypothesis is that facial soft-tissue changes following virtual osteotomy can be accurately simulated by our innovative approach using an anatomically detailed modeling and mapping routine, along with statistical modeling technique. To test our hypothesis, we propose to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual osteotomies, and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction. This approach can not only maintain the integrity of complex facial anatomy to accurately simulate the facial soft tissue deformation, but also significantly improve the computational efficiency in order to fit the requirement for clinical use  This project presents an innovative approach to model the facial soft-tissue deformation. If successful, it will allow accurate simulation of soft-tissue changes after virtual osteotomy. Patients will also be able to foresee the postoperative face preoperatively (patient education) and regain their psychological confidence. Finally, eFace will have significant impact and applications in orthodontics, plastic surgery, general surgery, growth/aging prediction, and forensic science. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring surgical correction for facial deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissu, or both, is escalating every year. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan bone reconstructive surgery, they have to use  their visual imagination with clinical experience to mentally predict the facial soft tissue changes  following the bone surgery because they do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change  that is resulted from skeletal reconstruction. 3.

"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,9132618,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'depression model', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic significance', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2016,48332,0.02449628312906184
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,9124921,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'dynamic system', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2016,504474,0.05548696826800106
"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness.

"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8908047,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'targeted imaging', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,193512,0.12611170679237832
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use. The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.",Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use,8816133,R01MH096951,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Gender', 'Generic Drugs', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'positive emotional state', 'skin color', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,452541,0.22757670437144356
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,8821669,R21MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R21,2015,225262,0.05500606075847072
"A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of patients suffering from craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities and requiring surgical correction is escalating. CMF deformities may involve skeleton, overlying soft-tissues, or the both. Patients with CMF deformities often have psychological problems. The goal of CMF surgery is to reconstruct a normal facial appearance and function, and the outcome of the surgery is judged as such. The current problem is that we do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change following skeletal reconstruction. In treating patients with isolated skeletal defects, the current practice is to normalize the skeleton, hoping for optimal facial appearance. However, because the thickness and contour of the soft-tissue envelope varies from patient to patient, this approach is not reliable. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, in the scenario of a patient with a skeletal deformity and a mild soft-tissue defect, a surgeon would have to know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But, this information can only be attained by having an accurate planning system to simulate soft-tissue changes. In addition, from patient's perspective, the final facial appearance is the most apparent to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-deformation.  Simulation methods must be accurate and fast. Attaining both is difficult because these attributes are inversely related, the more accurate the model, the longer it takes to prepare and run. Among the most effective, they are empirical-based model, mass spring model, finite element model, and mass tensor model. Unfortunately they are either too inaccurate or too slow, and clinically unacceptable.  Our hypothesis is that facial soft-tissue changes following virtual osteotomy can be accurately simulated by our innovative approach using an anatomically detailed modeling and mapping routine, along with statistical modeling technique. To test our hypothesis, we propose to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual osteotomies, and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction. This approach can not only maintain the integrity of complex facial anatomy to accurately simulate the facial soft tissue deformation, but also significantly improve the computational efficiency in order to fit the requirement for clinical use  This project presents an innovative approach to model the facial soft-tissue deformation. If successful, it will allow accurate simulation of soft-tissue changes after virtual osteotomy. Patients will also be able to foresee the postoperative face preoperatively (patient education) and regain their psychological confidence. Finally, eFace will have significant impact and applications in orthodontics, plastic surgery, general surgery, growth/aging prediction, and forensic science. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring surgical correction for facial deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissu, or both, is escalating every year. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan bone reconstructive surgery, they have to use  their visual imagination with clinical experience to mentally predict the facial soft tissue changes  following the bone surgery because they do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change  that is resulted from skeletal reconstruction. 3. We are proposing to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual skeletal surgery and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction.",A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery,8828669,R01DE021863,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Figs - dietary', 'Forensic Sciences', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Plastics', 'Postoperative Period', 'Property', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'balance testing', 'base', 'bone', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'experience', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'skeletal', 'skeletal surgery', 'soft tissue', 'system architecture', 'virtual']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2015,393538,0.06402322351437079
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,8978161,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2015,33015,0.02449628312906184
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8897409,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,521457,0.05548696826800106
"The Development and neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness.

Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness.

"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.            ",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8772435,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,194915,0.12611170679237832
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use.          The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.

"Multivariate Representations of Emotion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of affective neuroscience is to understand the brain systems and mechanisms underlying the evaluation, experience, and expression of emotion. For example, a widely studied and hotly debated issue in the field is the manner in which biophysical responses to emotional stimuli can be characterized, whether by distinct categories or alternatively along dimensions of valence and arousal. Advances in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science have fostered significant progress in identifying brain regions involved in processing emotion generally; however, consistent and specific neural markers for distinct affective states have yet to be found. This proposal uses a cutting-edge approach to this core, unresolved question in the field by harnessing emerging pattern classification techniques that are capable of detecting subtle yet coordinated signals from an array of sources. The overarching goal is to identify multivariate patterns of behavioral and biological responding to specific affective states and determine whether these states are organized according to categorical or dimensional architectures. By combining psychophysiology (Aim 1) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Aim 2), these studies will examine how humans respond to emotional stimuli that vary in duration, modality, and categorical nature. Study 1 focuses on distinct emotions elicited by instrumental music and movie clips whereas Study 2 focuses on those elicited by facial and vocal affect. Together, the aims will provide an integrative, computationally-rigorous method to identify biomarkers of specific emotions that are typically overlooked by conventional univariate statistical approaches. Applying machine learning algorithms in this innovative way could be fruitful for identifying how emotional representations are altered in affective disorders, with the potential for developing novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, identifying patterns of overlap between specific emotion categories may further aid efforts to understand comorbidity issues in anxiety and mood disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will identify patterns of brain and bodily responses that are representative of unique emotional states, using analytical methods that examine changes in multiple biological signals in concert. Identifying neural and peripheral representations of emotional states and how they relate to self-reports of emotion will provide a better understanding of how emotions are organized and coded in the brain and body. These biomarkers of specific emotions can provide clues as to how emotional processing is altered in mood and anxiety disorders and can lead to novel treatment targets.                    ",Multivariate Representations of Emotion,8685333,R21MH098149,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Face', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Music', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer science', 'design', 'emotional experience', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'movie', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,235500,0.07270638958977531
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.                ",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,8635153,R21MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R21,2014,269650,0.05500606075847072
"A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of patients suffering from craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities and requiring surgical correction is escalating. CMF deformities may involve skeleton, overlying soft-tissues, or the both. Patients with CMF deformities often have psychological problems. The goal of CMF surgery is to reconstruct a normal facial appearance and function, and the outcome of the surgery is judged as such. The current problem is that we do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change following skeletal reconstruction. In treating patients with isolated skeletal defects, the current practice is to normalize the skeleton, hoping for optimal facial appearance. However, because the thickness and contour of the soft-tissue envelope varies from patient to patient, this approach is not reliable. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, in the scenario of a patient with a skeletal deformity and a mild soft-tissue defect, a surgeon would have to know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But, this information can only be attained by having an accurate planning system to simulate soft-tissue changes. In addition, from patient's perspective, the final facial appearance is the most apparent to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-deformation.  Simulation methods must be accurate and fast. Attaining both is difficult because these attributes are inversely related, the more accurate the model, the longer it takes to prepare and run. Among the most effective, they are empirical-based model, mass spring model, finite element model, and mass tensor model. Unfortunately they are either too inaccurate or too slow, and clinically unacceptable.  Our hypothesis is that facial soft-tissue changes following virtual osteotomy can be accurately simulated by our innovative approach using an anatomically detailed modeling and mapping routine, along with statistical modeling technique. To test our hypothesis, we propose to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual osteotomies, and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction. This approach can not only maintain the integrity of complex facial anatomy to accurately simulate the facial soft tissue deformation, but also significantly improve the computational efficiency in order to fit the requirement for clinical use  This project presents an innovative approach to model the facial soft-tissue deformation. If successful, it will allow accurate simulation of soft-tissue changes after virtual osteotomy. Patients will also be able to foresee the postoperative face preoperatively (patient education) and regain their psychological confidence. Finally, eFace will have significant impact and applications in orthodontics, plastic surgery, general surgery, growth/aging prediction, and forensic science.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring surgical correction for facial deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissu, or both, is escalating every year. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan bone reconstructive surgery, they have to use  their visual imagination with clinical experience to mentally predict the facial soft tissue changes  following the bone surgery because they do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change  that is resulted from skeletal reconstruction. 3. We are proposing to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual skeletal surgery and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction.            ",A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery,8656620,R01DE021863,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Figs - dietary', 'Forensic Sciences', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Plastics', 'Postoperative Period', 'Property', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'balance testing', 'base', 'bone', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'experience', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'skeletal', 'skeletal surgery', 'soft tissue', 'system architecture', 'virtual']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2014,393538,0.06402322351437079
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally.

"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development.

Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness.

"A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion  Project Summary Past research has been very successful in defining how facial expressions of emotion are produced, including which muscle movements create the most commonly seen expressions. These facial expressions of emotion are then interpreted by our visual system. Yet, little is known about how these facial expressions are recognized. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the form and dimensions of the cognitive (computational) space used in this visual recognition. In particular, this proposal will study the following three hypotheses: Although facial expressions are produced by a complex set of muscle movements, expressions are generally easily identified at different spatial and time resolutions. However, it is not know what these limits are. Our first hypothesis (H1) is that recognition of facial expressions of emotion can be achieved at low resolutions and after short exposure times. In Aim 1, we define experiments to determine how many pixels and milliseconds (ms) are needed to successfully identify different emotions. The fact that expressions of emotion can be recognized quickly at low resolution indicates that simple features robust to image manipulation are employed. Our second hypothesis (H2) is that the recognition of facial expressions of emotion is partially accomplished by an analysis of configural features. Configural cues are known to play an important role in other face recognition tasks, but their role in the processing of expressions of emotion is not yet well understood. Aim 2 will identify a number of these configural cues. We will use real images of faces, manipulated versions of these face images, and schematic drawings. It is also known that shape features play a role in facial expressions (e.g., the curvature of the mouth in happiness). In Aim 3, we define a shape-based computational model. Our hypothesis (H3) is that the configural and shape features are defined as deviations from a mean (or norm) face as opposed to being described as a set of independent exemplars (Gnostic neurons). The importance of this computational space is not only to further justify the results of the previous aims, but to make new predictions that can be verified with additional experiments with human subjects.

"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use.          The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder.

"Multivariate Representations of Emotion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of affective neuroscience is to understand the brain systems and mechanisms underlying the evaluation, experience, and expression of emotion. For example, a widely studied and hotly debated issue in the field is the manner in which biophysical responses to emotional stimuli can be characterized, whether by distinct categories or alternatively along dimensions of valence and arousal. Advances in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science have fostered significant progress in identifying brain regions involved in processing emotion generally; however, consistent and specific neural markers for distinct affective states have yet to be found. This proposal uses a cutting-edge approach to this core, unresolved question in the field by harnessing emerging pattern classification techniques that are capable of detecting subtle yet coordinated signals from an array of sources. The overarching goal is to identify multivariate patterns of behavioral and biological responding to specific affective states and determine whether these states are organized according to categorical or dimensional architectures. By combining psychophysiology (Aim 1) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Aim 2), these studies will examine how humans respond to emotional stimuli that vary in duration, modality, and categorical nature. Study 1 focuses on distinct emotions elicited by instrumental music and movie clips whereas Study 2 focuses on those elicited by facial and vocal affect. Together, the aims will provide an integrative, computationally-rigorous method to identify biomarkers of specific emotions that are typically overlooked by conventional univariate statistical approaches. Applying machine learning algorithms in this innovative way could be fruitful for identifying how emotional representations are altered in affective disorders, with the potential for developing novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, identifying patterns of overlap between specific emotion categories may further aid efforts to understand comorbidity issues in anxiety and mood disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will identify patterns of brain and bodily responses that are representative of unique emotional states, using analytical methods that examine changes in multiple biological signals in concert. Identifying neural and peripheral representations of emotional states and how they relate to self-reports of emotion will provide a better understanding of how emotions are organized and coded in the brain and body. These biomarkers of specific emotions can provide clues as to how emotional processing is altered in mood and anxiety disorders and can lead to novel treatment targets.                    ",Multivariate Representations of Emotion,8510264,R21MH098149,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Face', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Music', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer science', 'design', 'emotional experience', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'movie', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,196250,0.07270638958977531
"A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of patients suffering from craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities and requiring surgical correction is escalating. CMF deformities may involve skeleton, overlying soft-tissues, or the both. Patients with CMF deformities often have psychological problems. The goal of CMF surgery is to reconstruct a normal facial appearance and function, and the outcome of the surgery is judged as such. The current problem is that we do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change following skeletal reconstruction. In treating patients with isolated skeletal defects, the current practice is to normalize the skeleton, hoping for optimal facial appearance. However, because the thickness and contour of the soft-tissue envelope varies from patient to patient, this approach is not reliable. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, in the scenario of a patient with a skeletal deformity and a mild soft-tissue defect, a surgeon would have to know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But, this information can only be attained by having an accurate planning system to simulate soft-tissue changes. In addition, from patient's perspective, the final facial appearance is the most apparent to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-deformation.  Simulation methods must be accurate and fast. Attaining both is difficult because these attributes are inversely related, the more accurate the model, the longer it takes to prepare and run. Among the most effective, they are empirical-based model, mass spring model, finite element model, and mass tensor model. Unfortunately they are either too inaccurate or too slow, and clinically unacceptable.  Our hypothesis is that facial soft-tissue changes following virtual osteotomy can be accurately simulated by our innovative approach using an anatomically detailed modeling and mapping routine, along with statistical modeling technique. To test our hypothesis, we propose to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual osteotomies, and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction. This approach can not only maintain the integrity of complex facial anatomy to accurately simulate the facial soft tissue deformation, but also significantly improve the computational efficiency in order to fit the requirement for clinical use  This project presents an innovative approach to model the facial soft-tissue deformation. If successful, it will allow accurate simulation of soft-tissue changes after virtual osteotomy. Patients will also be able to foresee the postoperative face preoperatively (patient education) and regain their psychological confidence. Finally, eFace will have significant impact and applications in orthodontics, plastic surgery, general surgery, growth/aging prediction, and forensic science.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring surgical correction for facial deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissu, or both, is escalating every year. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan bone reconstructive surgery, they have to use  their visual imagination with clinical experience to mentally predict the facial soft tissue changes  following the bone surgery because they do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change  that is resulted from skeletal reconstruction. 3. We are proposing to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual skeletal surgery and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction.            ",A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery,8439794,R01DE021863,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Figs - dietary', 'Forensic Sciences', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Plastics', 'Postoperative Period', 'Property', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'balance testing', 'base', 'bone', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'experience', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'skeletal', 'skeletal surgery', 'soft tissue', 'system architecture', 'virtual']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2013,387788,0.06402322351437079
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.                ",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8452565,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional RNA', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2013,571955,0.05548696826800106
"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.          Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.

"A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion  Project Summary Past research has been very successful in defining how facial expressions of emotion are produced, including which muscle movements create the most commonly seen expressions. These facial expressions of emotion are then interpreted by our visual system. Yet, little is known about how these facial expressions are recognized. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the form and dimensions of the cognitive (computational) space used in this visual recognition. In particular, this proposal will study the following three hypotheses: Although facial expressions are produced by a complex set of muscle movements, expressions are generally easily identified at different spatial and time resolutions. However, it is not know what these limits are. Our first hypothesis (H1) is that recognition of facial expressions of emotion can be achieved at low resolutions and after short exposure times.

Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.              Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels.

"A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion  Project Summary Past research has been very successful in defining how facial expressions of emotion are produced, including which muscle movements create the most commonly seen expressions. These facial expressions of emotion are then interpreted by our visual system. Yet, little is known about how these facial expressions are recognized. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the form and dimensions of the cognitive (computational) space used in this visual recognition. In particular, this proposal will study the following three hypotheses: Although facial expressions are produced by a complex set of muscle movements, expressions are generally easily identified at different spatial and time resolutions. However, it is not know what these limits are. Our first hypothesis (H1) is that recognition of facial expressions of emotion can be achieved at low resolutions and after short exposure times. In Aim 1, we define experiments to determine how many pixels and milliseconds (ms) are needed to successfully identify different emotions. The fact that expressions of emotion can be recognized quickly at low resolution indicates that simple features robust to image manipulation are employed. Our second hypothesis (H2) is that the recognition of facial expressions of emotion is partially accomplished by an analysis of configural features. Configural cues are known to play an important role in other face recognition tasks, but their role in the processing of expressions of emotion is not yet well understood. Aim 2 will identify a number of these configural cues. We will use real images of faces, manipulated versions of these face images, and schematic drawings. It is also known that shape features play a role in facial expressions (e.g., the curvature of the mouth in happiness). In Aim 3, we define a shape-based computational model. Our hypothesis (H3) is that the configural and shape features are defined as deviations from a mean (or norm) face as opposed to being described as a set of independent exemplars (Gnostic neurons). The importance of this computational space is not only to further justify the results of the previous aims, but to make new predictions that can be verified with additional experiments with human subjects.  Project Narrative Understanding how facial expressions of emotion are processed by our cognitive system will be important for studies of abnormal face and emotion visual processing in schizophrenia, autism and Huntington's disease. Also, abused children are more acute at recognizing emotions, suggesting a higher degree of expertise to some image features.

"Sensorimotor learning of facial expressions: A novel intervention for autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensorimotor learning of facial expressions: A novel intervention for autism Project Summary This application addresses broad Challenge Area (04): Clinical Research, and specific Challenge Topic 04-MH-101 Autism: Addressing the challenge: Novel interventions. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are impaired in their ability to produce and perceive dynamic facial expressions (Adolphs, Sears, and Piven, 2001). Advanced computer vision technologies can now be leveraged in the investigation of issues such as the facial expression recognition and production deficits common to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Not only can these technologies assist in quantifying these deficits, but they can also be used as part of interventions aimed at reducing deficit severity. In this project, automated facial expression recognition will be employed for the development of training exercises for facial expression production in children with ASD. Previous research by Tanaka and Schultz developed the Let's Face It! intervention tool shown to effectively improve the face processing abilities of children with ASD. Let's Face It! focused on perception but not production. Bartlett and Movellan have developed the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT), a computer vision system which measures 37 facial expression dimensions in real-time. This project brings together these two research groups in order to develop a computer assisted intervention system to enhance the social communication skills of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The computer vision tool enables novel interventions that focus on facial expression production. Intervention games will be developed to provide automated feedback on facial expressions produced by children with ASD in an engaging and cost- effective manner. In addition to improving production skills, practice with facial expression production may also improve perception skills by linking motor production with perception. The intervention exercises developed here will include closed-loop sensorimotor expression training in which subjects both see and produce facial expressions, and then view the effects of their facial expressions in the games. This project will also characterize facial expression production of children with ASD in a battery of assessment tasks, including automated facial expression measurement with CERT. Upon completion, this project will contribute to our understanding of facial expression production in children with ASD, provide a new intervention tool for facial expression production, and provide data on the efficacy of the intervention. The intervention system proposed here could have tremendous impact on social development in any patient population with atypical facial expression production, including ASD, and attention deficit disorder. The project will also contribute to the understanding of the development and learning of motor skills essential to social functioning.

"Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal describes a project to systematically investigate the facial components, combinations of components, and interactions of components that constitute facial expressions (nonmanual markers) in the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL). Some of these components have already been shown to differ in significant ways from those used by the general hearing population. They may carry semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic information that may not be provided by the manual signing itself. We will compile an inventory of facial articulations, construct a database of video images of these in isolation and in context, and use these data and innovative computational tools to construct a model of facial behavior in ASL. To successfully accomplish this, we propose an innovative integrated linguistic and computational approach to the study of nonmanuals. Our goal in this project is to construct an initial phonological model of ASL nonmanuals. We have targeted a relevant set of facial features and have identified 4 experiments to obtain appropriate information on each of them. A necessary step in preparation for these experiments is to develop computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms that automatically extract these facial features from a large quantity of videos. These algorithms will be capable of processing data more accurately and efficiently than can be done by hand. Finally, by comparing these results with those obtained from native ASL signers in a series of perceptual studies, we can determine what further modifications are still needed. The study of facial expressions in ASL has very practical applications to several areas affecting the lives of Deaf individuals. The absence of clear information on the facial components makes teaching them to individuals trying to learn ASL, such as parents, deaf children, future teachers and interpreters, a pedagogical nightmare. Another important practical application is the development of systems that automatically recognize ASL.

"Facial Expression Analysis by Image Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression provides cues about emotional response, regulates interpersonal behavior, and communicates aspects of psychopathology. Human-observer based methods for measuring facial expression are labor intensive, qualitative, and difficult to standardize. Our interdisciplinary team of computer and behavioral scientists has developed the CMU/Pitt Automated Facial Image Analysis (AFA) system that is capable of automatically recognizing facial action units and analyzing their timing in facial behavior. The quantitative measurement achieved by AFA represents a major advance over manual and subjective measurement without requiring the use of invasive sensors. We envision to use AFA's reliable, valid, and efficient measurement of emotion expression and related nonverbal behavior for assessment of symptom severity in depression. Current methods of clinical assessment of depression depend almost entirely on verbal report (clinical interview and/or questionnaire). They lack systematic and efficient ways of incorporating behavioral observations that are .strong indicators of depressive symptoms, especially those related to the timing of dyadic interaction between clinician and patient, much of which may occur outside the awareness of either individual. AFA is capable of extracting both the type and timing of nonverbal indicators of depression. Our hypothesis is that quantitative measures of the configuration and timing of facial expression, head motion, and gaze obtainable by AFA will improve clinical assessment of symptom severity and evaluation of treatment outcomes when combined with information from interviews and self-report questionnaires. We propose to test this hypothesis in 40 participants participating in a treatment intervention study for major depression. Interview, questionnaire, and video data will be collected at regular intervals over the course of treatment. To measure social dynamics, both patient and interviewer will be video recorded and processed using AFA. Longitudinal multilevel modeling will be used to test study hypotheses. We will improve further algorithms and capabilities of AFA to meet evaluation goals and prepare AFA for use by the scientific and clinical community.         n/a",Facial Expression Analysis by Image Processing,7049026,R01MH051435,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'emotions', 'face expression', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'interpersonal relations', 'statistics /biometry', 'videotape /videodisc', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2006,480876,0.09957349754303976

"Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal describes a project to systematically investigate the facial components, combinations of components, and interactions of components that constitute facial expressions (nonmanual markers) in the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL).

They may carry semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic information that may not be provided by the manual signing itself. We will compile an inventory of facial articulations, construct a database of video images of these in isolation and in context, and use these data and innovative computational tools to construct a model of facial behavior in ASL. To successfully accomplish this, we propose an innovative integrated linguistic and computational approach to the study of nonmanuals. Our goal in this project is to construct an initial phonological model of ASL nonmanuals. We have targeted a relevant set of facial features and have identified 4 experiments to obtain appropriate information on each of them. A necessary step in preparation for these experiments is to develop computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms that automatically extract these facial features from a large quantity of videos.

"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9920230,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'automated analysis', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,676651,0.06156640490863289
"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9912818,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,581743,0.061162353627011896
"Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation Maintaining an adaptive balance of emotions is central to well-being, and dysregulated emotions contribute broadly to clinical disorders that impart high personal and societal burdens. Recognizing the transdiagnostic importance of emotion to mental health, the National Institute of Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix contains overarching domains of Negative Valence, Positive Valence, and Arousal. However, the matrix underspecifies how specific affective states like sadness, anxiety, or craving are organized within and across these domains, in part because it is unknown whether representations of discrete emotions are reliably differentiated. Other RDoC constructs, such as rumination and worry, modify the temporal parameters of emotions that confer psychopathology risk and exacerbate symptom maintenance. Nonetheless, it is unknown how these processes interface with emotional brain circuits to impact affect dynamics, particularly as they often occur spontaneously during mind wandering. The proposed research promises to improve the RDoC depiction of these emotion-related constructs by taking an affective computing approach. During combined recording of psychophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), adult participants will experience emotions to vignettes and movie clips spanning the arousal and valence dimensions, and will report on their spontaneous emotions during resting-state fMRI scans. Machine learning algorithms will decode emotion- specific signals across the levels of analysis, which will be integrated using Bayesian state-space modeling. An analysis of classifier errors will test competing predictions from emotion theories regarding the optimal structure of affective space. Using graph theoretic tools, we will characterize the neural network architecture of the discrete emotion representations to identify provincial and connector hubs that can be used as novel targets for future symptom-specific or co-morbid neuromodulation interventions, respectively. We will apply the emotion-specific maps to resting-state data from the same participants to create neurophysiological indices of spontaneous emotions and to relate their frequencies to measures of trait and state affect as a validation step. Using stochastic modeling of the resting-state data, we will derive temporal dynamics metrics to test the hypothesis that rumination and worry promote emotional inertia during mind wandering. Finally, we will use existing data repositories to demonstrate that our novel indices of affect dynamics transdiagnostically differentiate resting-state fMRI activity patterns in mental health disorders from healthy controls. The proposed research will improve upon current RDoC formulations of Negative Affect, Positive Affect, and Arousal domains by informing how discrete emotions are organized within and across these domains, by integrating emotion representations across multiple RDoC units of analysis, by informing how rumination and worry impact neurophysiological signatures of spontaneous emotions, and by establishing the clinical utility of computationally-derived metrics of emotion dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall goal of this project is to characterize how emotions are represented in the brain and autonomic nervous system. Computational modeling approaches will be applied to integrate the data across multiple sources and tasks, to test competing theories about how emotions are organized, and to derive new metrics of emotion dynamics. The outcome of the work will inform how emotions should be conceptualized within a broader research framework of mental health domains.",Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation,10059052,R01MH124112,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'movie', 'negative affect', 'neural network architecture', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,774444,0.09012114101273398
"Bioethics of syndrome diagnosis using 3D image analysis Project Summary/Abstract This supplement will address the unintended consequences and collateral damage that arise when facial recognition software is used for medical purposes, such as for syndrome diagnosis as in our Facebase-funded project. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the accuracy of this technology varies based on self-reported race, sex and age. In this aim, we examine our existing database for evidence of bias based on self-reported race, sex or age. We further determine the extent to which these variables influence classification performance. To the extent sample sizes allow, we will carry this analysis to the level of specific syndromes. Finally, we will use anonymized reference datasets of non-syndromic faces to compare false positive rates based on NIH race definitions, sex and age. The outcome of this aim is to objectively establish bias and estimate the effects of under-representation across race, age and sex categories within our data. In Aim 2, we will determine how the reports of race-, sex- and age-based bias in facial recognition technology may influence views of the technology and its application amongst researchers and clinicians. This aim will establish the extent to which the storing of large databases of facial images and the application of machine learning processes to them for diagnostic purposes may raise privacy concerns. The concerns investigated will include potential hacks into protected health information; fear relating to the bias in some facial recognition software (and, potentially, in the Facebase database); and fear of discrimination in the application of the technology, such as by insurers. The outcome will be a white paper that targets a high-profile journal, summarizing the findings and defining crucial issues that should guide the development of facial imaging for disease diagnosis and clinical usage. Project Narrative Our supplement application will address the important question of unintended consequences and collateral damage when facial recognition software is used for medical purposes, such as for syndrome diagnosis as in our Facebase-funded project. The use of large facial recognition databases in medicine represents a frontier that arrives with tremendous potential but undeniable risks. Our central aims are: (1) determine whether the accuracy of this technology varies based on self-reported race, sex and age; and (2) determine how the reports of race-, sex- and age-based bias in facial recognition technology may influence views of the technology and its application amongst researchers and clinicians.",Bioethics of syndrome diagnosis using 3D image analysis,10132648,U01DE028729,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Authoritarianism', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioethics', 'Biometry', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computational Biology', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Journals', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient imaging', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Private Sector', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Sector', 'Race', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'craniofacial', 'disease diagnosis', 'facial recognition software', 'frontier', 'human data', 'intervention cost', 'new technology', 'professor', 'repository', 'sex', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2020,152200,0.09918373981037974
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9923725,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'social deficits', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,451783,0.11562546160517956
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention The understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion and motivation has grown steadily in the past two decades. The majority of the work in the rodent and human literatures has relied heavily on particular paradigms, such as the perception of faces with emotion content in humans, and aversive conditioning procedures in both humans and animals. The present application proposes a series of experimental paradigms that are ecologically inspired, semi- naturalistic, and dynamic.  The objective of this application is to investigate the dynamics of threat processing during escape behaviors, as well as the dynamics of threat/reward processing during approach- avoid conflict paradigms. Across experiments, we seek to both characterize and test specific hypotheses centered around a set of brain regions implicated in aversive and appetitive processing. We seek to characterize their contributions individually but also as distributed circuits that collectively and dynamically support behaviors.  The proposed work is organized around two aims. Aim 1 investigates the circuits supporting threat escape. Rodent studies suggest that the ventral striatum/accumbens is an important node during escape behaviors. Whereas some work in humans (e.g., avoidance conditioning) supports this notion, other work with ethologically inspired paradigms has also revealed the participation of regions such as the mid-cingulate cortex and the anterior hippocampus. Experiments will test the contributions of these and other brain regions to escape mechanisms. Aim 2 investigates the circuits involved in aversive and appetitive interactions during dynamic threat and reward processing. Experiments will employ dynamic stimuli where the proximity to threat and reward vary dynamically.  Collectively, the work addresses a set of basic research questions aimed at understanding how emotion/motivation circuits outlined in the past decades supports dynamic processing. The potential results may inform the clinically-oriented human literature, which has been heavily informed and inspired by research with standard experimental paradigms. This project aims to study emotion and motivation in the human brain of typical participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We will study mechanisms of escaping from threat and approaching reward and how they interact. The project attempts to contribute to the understanding to processes that support many human behaviors, and may inform potential treatments of conditions such as anxiety disorders and substance abuse.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,10058351,R01MH071589,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Coin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'aversive conditioning', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'gang', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'reward processing', 'stem', 'virtual']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,719764,0.03723005196923983
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9840518,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,573248,0.13235232654940018
