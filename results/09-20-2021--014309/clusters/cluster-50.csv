"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS. The candidate for this award Dr. Haoyin Zhou is a postdoc at Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Zhou has extensive experience and expertise in computer vision, machine learning and their applications in medicine. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. National Center for Image Guided Therapy, and Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite will greatly support this research. Dr. Zhou’s long-term research goal is to develop and apply advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of medical image processing and image-guided therapy. To achieve these goals, Dr. Zhou plans to receive more education and training in the following four areas: (1) Critical training in conducting translational research in the hospital environment with surgeons and radiologists, (2) knowledge in the development of technologies for surgical guidance, (3) training in machine learning and its applications in medicine, and (4) training on writing grant applications independently and seeking funding. Dr. Zhou will participate in formal courses selected from Harvard, Harvard Catalyst, MIT CSAIL and Stanford Courses. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH, HMS and MIT. He will also attend one or two academic conferences per year to discuss his work and meet with experts in the field. A strong mentoring team, including one primary mentor, three co-mentors, and two collaborators, has been organized for the K99 phase of this award, which will provide solid support on both research and career development to Dr. Zhou based on their well-established expertise in diverse research fields.

Drs. Ali Tavakkoli and Jiping Wang (co- mentors) are experienced surgeons. All mentors and collaborators are from BWH, HMS. Project Narrative  Minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS) has many potential advantages but liver deformation leads to significant difficulties in localizing tumors and avoiding main vessels accurately. This project aims to develop a novel surgical navigation approach as a tool to guide MILS intraoperatively. Novel computer vision and machine learning algorithms, including GPU-based non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM), learning- based landmarks recognition and non-rigid registration will be developed to compensate for live deformation and map preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy in real-time during MILS.",Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery,9822028,K99EB027177,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Binocular Vision', 'Blood', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hepatic', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laparoscopes', 'Laparoscopy', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Navigation System', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pneumoperitoneum', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Respiration', 'Robotics', 'Solid', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Titan', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'frontier', 'haptics', 'human disease', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'postoperative recovery', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'research clinical testing', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'tissue reconstruction', 'tool', 'tumor', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K99,2019,93280,0.031741179312296745
"Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CANDIDATE (Andrew J. Hung, MD): My long-term goal is to establish a career in innovating training methods for robotic surgery which will lead to curtailing surgeon learning curve, and maximize patient safety. My first step towards that goal focuses on understanding objective metrics that measure surgeon performance, and how machine learning algorithms can process that data to guide training. I have developed a career development program that builds on my clinical training in robotic urologic surgery and prior research in surgical training. Through mentorship, a fellowship, and formal coursework, this K23 award will provide me the necessary support to develop expertise in 3 areas where I do not have formal training, yet are critical to my success: (1) Machine learning; (2) Surgical education; (3) Advanced statistical skills and study design. MENTORING TEAM: My career development and research plans leverage existing institutional resources, including the USC Machine Learning Center, led by co-primary mentor Dr. Yan Liu; and Keck Hospital of USC, the second busiest robotic center by volume in the United States and the USC Institute of Urology (led by co- primary mentor and chairman Dr. Inderbir Gill), home to pioneers of several urologic surgical techniques with a robust research apparatus supporting several NIH-funded clinical scientists. My mentoring team is complemented by co-mentor Dr. Robert Sweet, a DOD-funded expert on surgical education; career mentor Dr. Larissa Rodriguez, a federally funded clinician/scientist experienced in mentoring K awardees; educational psychology collaborator Dr. Kenneth Yates, an authority on cognitive task analysis; and consultant Dr. Anthony Jarc, at Intuitive Surgical who has supported much of the pilot data on objective performance metrics. The proposed K23 work truly requires the robust collaboration of experts in robotic surgery, education, and machine learning. RESEARCH: The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is steep: over 100 cases. Current ‘gold standard’ methods of surgical assessment rely on subjective expert review, but such evaluations are time consuming and inconsistent. Nonetheless, credentialing a surgeon to perform robotic surgery has enormous implications - patient outcomes are at risk, and a surgeon’s career is on the line. Informed by my clinical expertise in robotic urological surgery and preliminary data, I will develop a novel method of utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to objectively assess robotic surgeon performance and to guide training for the vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA), the most critical reconstructive part of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). I will develop and validate objective metrics directly captured from the da Vinci robot during the VUA (Aim 1), train machine learning algorithms to assess a surgeon’s performance of VUA (Aim 2), and utilize ML algorithms to guide surgeons learning the VUA (Aim 3). Armed with these data and skills from this award, I will be uniquely suited to utilize machine learning to generalize objective surgeon assessment for robot-assisted surgical procedures within and beyond urology. Finally, the results from this study will provide preliminary data for independent funding through mechanisms such as an NIH R01 grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer is steep, and current methods of evaluating surgeons require subjective and time-consuming expert review. Streamlined training and assessment utilizing objective performance metrics and machine learning algorithms can significantly curtail learning curve with patients, and decrease the overall morbidity of prostate cancer treatment.",Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy,9767765,K23EB026493,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Chairperson', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Credentialing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational Psychology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urethra', 'Urologic Surgical Procedures', 'Urology', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive task', 'common treatment', 'computer program', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'peer', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'robot assistance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'task analysis', 'urologic', 'virtual reality']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K23,2019,193082,0.0528508391144663
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9739350,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,426737,0.035333455835604155
"Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data Project Summary For epileptic patients who undergo brain resection or ablation interventions, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate seizure status, whether controlled or relapsed. Yet, it is data from the preoperative brain that drives the postoperative prediction process – a critical process for both patient and doctor, and one that is only clinically meaningful when seizure outcomes are predicted presurgically to optimize surgical-decision making. Accordingly, we propose to develop a multi-step model that will establish more accurate predictors of post- surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) emphasizing post-surgical status, for it is the areas of the brain spared during surgery that form the neural substrates generating postoperative seizures. A second perspective motivating our project is the need to identify those changes in functional and structural brain network organization that support adaptive versus maladaptive seizure outcomes following brain surgery. These are the network changes (e.g., the new seizure generators) that dispose and place a potential surgical candidate on a specific outcome trajectory. Therefore, identifying the phenotypes of brain reorganization and change, and incorporating their status into presurgical predictive models of outcome will likely prove crucial to enhancing our ability to predict postoperative neuroplastic responses. While existing outcome prediction models in TLE have focused on clinical variables (e.g., lesional status), we choose instead to focus on structural and functional measures of network reorganization (communication dynamics, regional interactions, structural control). This stems from our belief that capturing network changes throughout the whole postsurgical brain offers a better practical method for identifying and predicting the latent seizure foci (epileptogenesis) that will emerge after surgery. Through machine learning techniques we will deliver an algorithm to be used with new, potential surgical patients, an algorithm that utilizes solely presurgical data, but incorporates our innovative prediction about postsurgical brain organization. Accordingly, our approach provides both a methodologic and conceptual (reorganization phenotypes) advance. The scientific premise leading to our hypotheses is that the failure in the literature to account for the impact of unresected/ablated brain regions, and the brain reorganizations these areas compel, has seriously impeded the predictive power of previous outcome models. Project Narrative For epileptic patients undergoing brain surgery, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate whether seizures are controlled or not. Accordingly, we propose to develop a model that predicts post-surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy, emphasizing the reorganization and change in brain network communication and control that comes with post-surgical status, for it is these features that will actually generate postsurgical seizures. Our innovation is the use of post-operative brain reorganization phenotypes to predict on a presurgical basis who will be disposed to a good vs poor outcome trajectory, highlighting that it is the failure to account for the impact of spared regions, and the brain organization changes these compel, which has seriously impeded the predictive power of prior outcome models.",Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data,9803083,R01NS112816,"['Ablation', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Generalized Epilepsy', 'Health Personnel', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organizational Change', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Thalamic structure', 'Work', 'base', 'brain surgery', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'surgery outcome']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,490043,0.06321193919346639
"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",9643500,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Injury', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'simulation', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,694170,0.03936702433465303
"Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers Superficially spreading types of skin cancers such as lentigo maligna melanomas (LMMs) and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) occur mostly on older patients, with diffuse sub-clinical sub-surface spread over large areas and with poorly defined margins that are difficult to detect. To treat these cancers, dermatologists rou- tinely perform a large number of mapping biopsies to determine the spread and margins, followed by surgical excision with wide ""safety"" margins. Not surprisingly, such a ""blind"" approach results in under-sampling of the margins, over-sampling of normal skin, too many false positives and false negatives, and too much loss of normal skin tissue. What may help address this problem is reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging to noninvasively delineate margins, directly on patients. RCM imaging detects skin cancers in vivo with sensitivity of 85-95% and specificity 80-70%. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted reim- bursement codes for RCM imaging of skin. RCM imaging is now being increasingly used to noninvasively guide diagnosis, sparing patients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. While the two-decade effort leading to the granting of these codes was focused on imaging-guided diagnosis, emerging applications are in imaging to guide therapy. We propose to create an approach called RCM video-mosaicking, to noninvasively map skin cancer margins over large areas on patients, with increased sampling, accuracy and sparing of nor- mal tissue. The innovation will be in designing a highly robust (against tissue warping and motion artifacts) and high speed (real-time, seconds) approach for RCM video-mosaicking: we will develop an optical flow ap- proach with a novel hybrid 3-stage deep learning network comprising of 8 parameters that will model global and local rigid and non-rigid tissue motion dynamics, learn and adapt to variable tissue and speckle noise con- ditions in patients, and predict and automatically detect motion blur artifacts. As required by PAR-18-009, our academic-industrial partnership will deliver RCM video-mosaicking to clinicians for real-time implementation at the bedside (translational novelty). Our proposed application is for guiding surgical excision, but the approach will have wider impact, for guiding new and emerging less invasive non-surgical treatments for superficial skin cancers. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated RCM video-mosaicking with real-time speed (125 millisec- onds per frame, 8 frames per second), and registration errors of 1.02 ± 1.3 pixels relative to field-of-view of 1000 x 1000 pixels. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a real-time and robust RCM video-mosaicking ap- proach and incorporate into a handheld confocal microscope for use at the bedside, (2) to test the approach for image quality and clinical acceptability, and (3) to prospectively test on 100 patients, with pre-surgical video- mosaicking of LMM margins and superficial NMSC margins, followed by validation against post-surgical pa- thology. We are a highly synergistic team from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern Uni- versity, and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.), with a 13-year record of collaboration. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging can noninvasively diagnose skin cancers, and spare patients from biopsies of benign skin conditions. We propose to develop an approach to noninvasively delineate skin cancer margins, to help guide less invasive surgery, and help more accurately and completely remove cancer while preserving more of the surrounding normal skin.",Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers,9801564,R01CA240771,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Dermatologist', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Excision', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Grant', 'Hutchinson&apos', 's Melanotic Freckle', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Video Microscopy', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'blind', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'design', 'expectation', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'older patient', 'preservation', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'vector']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,667106,0.056727875047081495
"Real-time non-intrusive workload monitoring-Integration of human factors in surgery training and assessment Project Summary/Abstract (30 lines)  High physiological and cognitive workload required in de-coupled surgical work demands may have significant impact on patient outcome, surgical efficacy, and surgical performance. As novel surgical techniques, e.g., telesurgery, are developed, surgical operations will become more complex and the mental and physical demand on surgeons will likely increase, making it critical to develop remote and connected workload monitoring methods for the safe and effective surgical procedure design, testing, and training. This work will implement novel technology and machine learning analytics to quantify real-time and remote workload and test how workload feedback can impact care delivery in both in telesurgery and surgical simulation environments. Our overall hypothesis is that connected sensing technology in telesurgical procedures and simulation can improve surgical training and understanding of the impact of their workload on performance; ultimately improving patient health, surgery efficacy, and patient access (e.g., tele-mentoring) to surgical care. Two specific aims are proposed to investigate this hypothesis.  The objective of Specific Aim 1 is to develop a connected sensor system to objectively quantify workload real-time in simulated telerobotic procedures. This involves: 1) integrating non-intrusive sensors into a single system within the simulation trainer or environment, 2) training machine learning techniques to objectively distinguish workload using a simulated surgical skills tasks, and 3) validating metrics across varying levels of cognitive loads under various task difficulty with medical trainees and expert participants.  The objective of Specific Aim 2 is to determine the impact of the real-time workload feedback intervention on trainee performance times, errors, and intraoperative workload. Two tasks are proposed: 1) Explore modalities preferred by surgeons for providing real-time feedback on workload and 2) Assess impact of workload feedback on task performance and learning. Our primary hypothesis is that performance times and errors will improve when participants are provided realtime feedback on workload compared to performance with no feedback.  The expected deliverables include 1) workload monitoring technology, algorithms, and software for complementing current simulation-based training, 2) objective and automated workload metrics, 3) real-time assistive intervention tool, and 4) preliminary evidence on impact of workload monitoring on training. The technology in this proposed work will improve public health by reducing adverse events due to human factors in surgery and improve access to surgical care with intervention technology that can adaptively train surgeons and remotely assess proficiency. Project Narrative High physiological and cognitive workload required in de-coupled surgical work demands may have significant impact on patient outcome, surgical efficacy, and surgical team performance. Our overall hypothesis is that connected sensing technology, machine learning analytics, and real-time user-centered feedback on cognitive and physiological workload in telesurgical procedures and simulation can improve surgical training and understanding of the impact of their workload on performance; ultimately improving patient health, surgery efficacy, and patient access to surgical care.

"Patient specific 3D printed tissue engineered vascular graft for aortic reconstruction designed by artificial intelligence algorithm. 1 The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered  2 vascular grafts (TEVG) for use in aortic arch repair surgery. These TEVGs are optimized for high pressure  3 circulation using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence, and will grow with the patient, in hopes of  4 obviating need for future surgeries to replace grafts, which can occur with contemporary arch reconstruction  5 materials. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death due to congenital anomalies. Despite  6 significant advances in surgical management for CHD, one significant source of morbidity and mortality arises  7 from the complexity of surgery for diverse anatomies in the aortic arch. Previous studies have demonstrated  8 that the resultant arch geometry after surgical reconstruction of stenotic or hypoplastic aortas is important to  9 minimize reduce energy loss and undesirable flow inside the arch, which can lead to hypertension, abnormal 10 vascular response and ventricular dysfunction. Ensuring a patient-specific graft design for ideal reconstructed 11 route before surgery with minimum energy loss and wall shear stress may yield long-term benefits for patient 12 health and quality of life. 13 We have demonstrated native vessel like neotissue formation of TEVG in small and large animal 14 studies. Based on these experiences, we have developed a novel 3D printing technology combining 3D printed 15 metal mandrels with nanofiber electro-spun technology. With this 3D printing technology, we showed that 16 TEVG developed native like neovessel formation in venous circulation in a sheep model. For this next step, we 17 aim to develop grafts in arterial circulation that can be applied to aortic reconstruction. We will also develop 18 automatic design algorithms to design optimal graft shape in order to reduce time and cost of patient specific 19 design. We hypothesize that patient-specific TEVG using our 3D printing technology can be designed, 20 aided by pre-operative imaging and flow data, computer assisted design (CAD), automatic design 21 algorithms based on computation fluid dynamics (CFD) results, and will demonstrate proper neotissue 22 formation and growth while maintaining optimally designed hemodynamics. 23 This project will be an important step towards clinical application of patient-specific vascular grafts that 24 recapitulate the native anatomy and mechanical properties. The results of this work will have a broader impact 25 on the design and fabrication of other more complex cardiovascular structures for implantation. This paradigm 26 shift in vascular graft technology will improve the quality and safety of pediatric patient care. The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered vascular grafts using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence for use in aortic arch repair surgery which demands a structured surgical approach in order to optimize hemodynamics postoperatively. We will optimize the design of an aortic graft automatically using computational flow dynamics, refine 3D printing manufacturing, evaluate grafts with in-vitro testing, and finally will test the performance of the grafts in vivo over time.

"Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Closed or open fracture reduction and internal fixation is the standard surgical approach in treating pelvic fractures, with current clinical practice using fluoroscopic guidance, guidewire insertion, and cannulated screw placement. The challenge in reckoning complex 3D morphology in 2D fluoroscopy presents a major source of uncertainty, trial-and- error, and poor outcomes, with 20-30% rate of suboptimal screw placement and long fluoroscopic runtime (mean fluoro time > 123 s) exposing operating personnel to high levels of radiation exposure. Despite these challenges, mainstream surgical approach has remained largely unchanged for 35 years, and surgical navigation systems (though increasingly common in neurosurgery) present cost and workflow barriers that limit their broad applicability in trauma surgery. We propose a computer vision-based navigation approach that is compatible with routine trauma surgery workflow, offers real-time guidance with accuracy comparable to stereotactic navigation, gives ten-fold reduction in radiation exposure, and works with tools already common in the trauma surgery arsenal. The proposed system uses a miniature stereoscopic camera mounted onboard the surgical drill in combination with 3D-2D registration of fluoroscopic views for direct, real-time registration of the instrument trajectory relative to patient anatomy. Real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views and/or CT permits accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within bone corridors and will reduce reliance on “fluoro hunting” and trial-and-error guidewire placement. The following aims develop and evaluate the system for application in pelvic trauma surgery, including quantitative assessment of accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose in pre-clinical studies. Aim 1. System for computer vision-based guidance in trauma surgery. The hardware and software components required for vision-based tracking onboard a standard surgical drill will be developed, providing real-time trajectory overlay in fluoroscopy and/or preoperative CT. A fast calibration method will be developed for automatic drill axis calibration. Automatic feature-based registration of the video and fluoroscopic frames enables real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views (Fluoro Navigation), and 3D-2D registration between CT and fluoroscopy will enable real-time overlay of the instrument trajectory in CT (CT Navigation). Aim 2: Evaluation in preclinical studies. The vision-based navigation system will be implemented in pre-clinical (cadaver) experiments to evaluate accuracy and workflow. These studies will evaluate the geometric accuracy and workflow factors relating to the number of repeated insertion attempts, procedure time, and radiation dose, evaluating vision-based Fluoro Navigation and CT Navigation in comparison to conventional freehand fluoroscopy guidance. Successful completion of the aims will establish a system suitable for computer vision-based navigation to be translated to clinical studies in future work. Such a system offers a potentially major advance in routine trauma surgery, bringing capabilities comparable to state-of-the-art stereotactic navigation without the cost, complexity, and additional workflow of conventional navigation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even experienced trauma surgeons are challenged in resolving the complex 3D morphology of the pelvis in 2D x-ray fluoroscopy, presenting a major source of uncertainty, a high rate of malpositioned screws, and high levels of radiation exposure to the patient and operating staff. To facilitate high-precision pelvic trauma surgery and reduce intraoperative radiation dose, we propose a computer vision-based navigation approach providing real-time overlay of surgical instrument trajectories in fluoroscopic views and CT, facilitating accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within safe bone corridors. The approach offers a major advance compared to conventional navigation by not requiring intraoperative 3D imaging, avoiding time-consuming calibration, and eliminating externally-positioned hardware in the operating room, and the proposed research translates the system from basic development and quantitative testing to preclinical studies evaluating geometric accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose.",Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery,9806153,R21EB028330,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Calibration', 'Clinical Research', 'Closed Fractures', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Mainstreaming', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Navigation System', 'Needles', 'Open Fractures', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Uncertainty', 'Visceral', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'neurovascular', 'pelvis fracture', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'sample fixation', 'socioeconomics', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,238182,0.03914720600871719
"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi-resolution imaging of the brain and spine while the surgeon operates.",An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System,9764897,R44CA112966,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Capital', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Michigan', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Monitor', 'Navigation System', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spine surgery', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Veterinary Schools', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cancer surgery', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cranium', 'deep neural network', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'neurosurgery', 'next generation', 'operation', 'point of care', 'portability', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spine bone structure', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2019,1350820,0.03005044101375438
"Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants Impressive advances in cochlear implant (CI) technology in recent years have placed within our grasp the possibility of developing spoken language. However, one remaining question is why CI children as a group still perform below their normal-hearing peers and why performance varies across individuals. In searching for the sources of language development variability in young CI children, our proposed study will also seek to construct clinically useful models that capitalize on pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures for predicting post-surgical language development outcomes at the individual level. At the Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, we have collected pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures and post-surgical speech outcome data from about 130 (70 prospectively and 60 retrospectively) subjects over the past five years. We also conducted a preliminary study that demonstrates that individual patients can be classified into better or poorer language improvers six months post-surgery by a machine-learning algorithm that makes predictions based on neuroanatomical measures established pre-surgery. Our proposed study will seek to extend this preliminary research by: (1) continuing data collection and analyzing a larger set of neural measures and outcome data up to two years post-surgery, and (2) testing the generalizability of the predictive models built in Chicago to CI patients of similar characteristics at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Michigan in order to evaluate the models' broader clinical utility. Our studies will be constructed to test two competing hypotheses. The neural preservation hypothesis postulates that brain regions that are unaffected by hearing loss contribute most to language development outcomes, and that they most likely encompass auditory association areas and cognitive brain regions. The neural cycling hypothesis argues that post-surgical language development relies on the recovery of the brain regions that are most affected by hearing loss, most likely in the primary auditory cortical regions. If successful, our predictive models could immediately be deployed to augment current clinical practice, because they concern patient outcome at the individual level. Ultimately, our predictive information will allow clinicians and parents to plan more carefully for post-surgical therapy and to identify personalized management strategies for individual children. Our study directly addresses Priority Area 3 in Hearing and Balance Research of the latest NIDCD Strategic Plan.     Although cochlear implants have allowed better spoken language development in early-deafened children, the language and cognitive abilities of these children continue to lag behind those of their normal-hearing peers. The proposed study will seek to use pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures to predict post-surgical language outcomes in young children who have received a CI in order to assist in better post-surgical planning and the optimization of therapy.    ",Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants,9733185,R21DC016069,"['4 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Equilibrium', 'Fiber', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recycling', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Strategic Planning', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Surgical Management', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'auditory deprivation', 'auditory pathway', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cognitive ability', 'deaf', 'grasp', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'language outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural model', 'normal hearing', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'personalized management', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'treatment optimization']",NIDCD,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,R21,2019,173098,0.00732187866007154
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery.

"Micro-endoscopic impedance sensing for surgical margin assessment ABSTRACT The primary objective of surgical therapy for the treatment of patients with any cancer is to remove all cancer cells from within the body, with the secondary objective of maintaining organ function. The primary pathological metric used to rate the success of a surgical procedure is evaluation of the surgical margin of the resected tissue specimen, post-operatively. This typically involves cutting the tissue into sections and microscopically exploring these tissue samples for the presence of cancer cells at the margins. Cancer cells noted at the margins represent Positive Surgical Margins (PSMs) and suggest that cancer cells were left in the body following the procedure. As a result, patients with PSMs are often exposed to noxious additional procedures to eradicate the cancer cells left behind including radiation, chemical, hormonal, and additional surgical therapy; these all have adverse morbidities that decrease a patient's quality of life. No clinical protocols are routinely used to intraoperatively assess surgical margin status during surgical procedures. Instead, margins are evaluated through microscopic assessment of the tissue following the procedure, when it is too late to provide additional surgical intervention. We aim to develop an intraoperative device able to assess surgical margin status so that the surgeons can extract additional tissues in real-time and ultimately decrease the rates of PSMs. While our technology can be applied for most cancer surgeries, we are focusing our commercialization efforts on prostate and breast cancer as these are the highest incidence and cause of death for men and women, respectively, and because patients with PSMs following these procedures have a much higher rate of recurrence than patients that have negative surgical margins. We have previously shown that the electrical impedance (a property that describes how easily electrical current passes through a tissue) of tissue is sensitive to a tissue's cellular arrangement and can be used to distinguish cancer from benign tissue in both prostate and breast. We have developed a prototype flexible endoscopic device capable of sensing electrical impedance of tissue during radical prostatectomy procedures for use in Machine Learning-based tissue classification and Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) imaging techniques. This device makes intraoperative focal measurements of margin status. Here we aim to take the significant step of constructing an optimized EII device that can be deployed either laparoscopically (e.g. prostate surgery) or in open procedures (e.g. breast surgery) to provide an accurate method of intraoperatively identifying positive surgical margins. We aim to develop this device and evaluate the technology in an ex vivo study of human prostates to confirm device functionality. By the end of this program we intend to have developed a low-cost, single use probe that can be deployed for intraoperative surgical margin assessment. In follow-on Phase II funding, we will focus our technical design efforts on developing a custom data acquisition system and visualization platform and preparing for an IDE submission to the FDA. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary objective of cancer surgery is to remove all cancer cells from the body and maintain sufficient organ functionality; cancer left behind in the body following tissue resection, in the form of positive surgical margins, is significantly correlated with cancer recurrence. No technologies currently on the market are able to intraoperatively evaluate the tissue remaining in the patient to confirm that all cancer has been resected. The electrical impedance of tissue provides significant contrast between benign and malignant formations and we propose to develop a electrical impedance sensing probe for use in evaluating intraoperative surgical margin status in real-time.",Micro-endoscopic impedance sensing for surgical margin assessment,9680905,R41CA235994,"['Adjuvant Therapy', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Breast', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Tissue', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Resected', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specimen', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Urethra', 'Woman', 'analog', 'base', 'breast surgery', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer surgery', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'college', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'flexibility', 'foot', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neurovascular', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prostate surgery', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'success', 'urinary bladder neck']",NCI,"RYTEK MEDICAL, INC.",R41,2019,224572,0.0716613911317755
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance Project Summary Post-surgical complications (PSCs) have been an increasing concern for hospitals, particularly in light of payment reform focusing on longer episodes and Medicare penalties for 30-day readmissions and adverse outcomes including deep or organ space surgical site infections (DOS-SSIs). Readmission due to post- discharge complications in particular has become a target for quality improvement since many of these events are considered preventable. The wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to a number of clinical risk models for PSCs. These modeling efforts have primarily been targeted at the surgical specialty areas within which a large number of events occur (such as colorectal surgery) as well as applying sophisticated statistical modeling / machine learning to allow for missing data, interactions, and nonlinearities. However, there is still considerable room for improvement both in terms of accuracy and generalizability. In our current funding period, we have demonstrated the predictive value of clinical notes for PSCs. However, one glaring limitation of current models is that they are trained on high volume surgical specialties at large tertiary care institutions with high quality clinical data and use of advanced informatics approaches. The impetus of this proposal is essentially two-fold: (i) Accurate models can be created for lower volume institutions and specialties via transfer learning and leveraging more data via unconfirmed outcomes (i.e., those that mimic gold standard outcomes, but are less reliable) with proper accounting of reliability. (ii) Decision making can be significantly improved by leveraging time varying, real-time data such as labs, vitals, and clinical notes to provide the current risk of PSCs for patients using all information as it becomes available. We aim to i) develop and apply longitudinal risk models for PSCs to explicitly account for the time varying nature of some of the information (e.g., labs, vitals, clinical notes) as it becomes available in real-time so that it can be integrated into the clinician’s decision making; ii) develop and apply transfer learning to PSC risk models; iii) develop modeling approaches that allow for the use of more widely available unconfirmed outcomes, while explicitly accounting for the additional uncertainty and bias due to the use of such unconfirmed outcomes when compared to a less available gold standard; and iv) develop a widely applicable framework for model evaluation and monitoring. Models will often not perform in practice as they do in research for a variety of reasons. This framework will allow us to identify these issues and more efficiently translate and apply these complex predictive models into practice so that the research can have an immediate clinical impact. Successful development would open the door for next generation patient monitoring, alerts, and interventions for all surgical specialties and all institutions. We will make the relevant modeling results publicly available so that lower volume institutions can leverage the transfer learning approach developed here without the need for our actual data. This will ultimately lead to improved patient care and lower overall cost by identifying complications early and limiting readmission due to PSCs at Mayo Clinic and other institutions across the nation. Narrative Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EHRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EHRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EHRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9840336,R01EB019403,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breast', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Surgery', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Glare', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Surgical Specialties', 'Surgical complication', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'health care quality', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'indexing', 'medical specialties', 'microbiome', 'next generation', 'novel', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid growth', 'risk prediction model', 'tertiary care']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,643686,0.08214092159362323
"Enabling Technology for Safe Robot-assisted Surgical Micromanipulation Project Summary  The goal of this grant is to develop enabling technology and systems that address fundamental limitations in microsurgery with a specific focus on vitreoretinal surgery. Due to the inherent micro-scale and the fragility of the neurosensory retina, vitreoretinal surgeons can be challenged by physiological hand tremor where the tremor amplitude is larger than retinal structures, delicate movements that are below tactile sensation, and multiple cognitive decisions that are required when executing high-risk movements, such as during retinal vein cannulation (RVC). Nevertheless currently vitreoretinal surgery is at the limits of human physiological performance and lacks the adequate technology that could further improve the technical performance. This situation is less than optimal and can significantly benefit from the recent advances in medical robotics, sensor feedback and human machine interface design. Robotic assistance may be ideally suited to address common problems encountered in the performance of the demanding micromanipulations in retinal microsurgery.  We propose a robotic system with enhanced real-time multisensory feedback that assesses multiple points of instrument contact located both inside and outside of the eye. Our comprehensive system will enable the surgeon to manipulate tools based on quantitative feedback that will prevent mechanical injury by implementing safeguards against the application of excessive and previously unmeasurable forces at the eyewall and the tool tip. Our aims are: (1) Develop and demonstrate in vivo position/force hybrid control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy for safe robot-assisted vitreoretinal microsurgery: real-time sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy will be uniquely used to control the robot through a machine learning method that adaptively learns a nonlinear mapping from user behavior to sclera-force/position and predicts unsafe motions; (2) Develop and demonstrate in vivo force-input control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the tool-tip for safe robot-assisted vein cannulation: real-time tool- tip-to-tissue interaction force sensing and non-linear robot control algorithms based on observing the user behavior will be used to control the tool-tip position and force and to prevent entry into subretinal areas during RVC; (3) Demonstrate safe robot-assisted RVC in rabbit model in vivo: real-time, position/force hybrid control algorithms based on dual-point (tool-shaft and tip) information fusion will provide sensorimotor guidance of surgical maneuvers during RVC. Statistically significant results in vivo, in clinically realistic conditions will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.  This highly innovative system will enable surgeons to perform maneuvers in a tremor free environment with a higher level of precision than previously possible and with the ability to sense forces on a scale that have been previously imperceptible. We envision this development as a logical next step in the integration of man, machine and computer for the performance of unprecedented microsurgical maneuvers. Project Narrative  This R01 grant addresses fundamental limitations in current microsurgical practice, focusing on vitreoretinal surgery (VRS), which is the most technically demanding ophthalmologic surgery. Our goal is to develop a cooperatively controlled robotic system with enhanced sensorimotor capabilities that in conjunction with multifunction force-sensing microsurgical instruments could enable safe robot-assisted retinal surgery. Although focused on VRS, our results will be applicable to a broader range of microsurgical training and practice.",Enabling Technology for Safe Robot-assisted Surgical Micromanipulation,9636559,R01EB023943,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Cannulations', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Micromanipulation', 'Microsurgery', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Retinal Perforations', 'Retinal Vein Occlusion', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sclera', 'Site', 'Sterilization', 'Structure', 'Structure of central vein of the retina', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Veins', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'design', 'dexterity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'medical specialties', 'multisensory', 'neurosensory', 'neurosurgery', 'operation', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'robotic system', 'sensor', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'trend', 'virtual']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,356164,0.06717216757099478
"Augmented reality visualization for intraoperative guidance based on fluorescence lifetime Project summary/Abstract Optical imaging techniques have demonstrated potential to delineate tumor margins in vivo during surgery as they can rapidly characterize structural, biochemical or functional properties of tissue. Implementation in clinical practice demands rapid visualization and augmentation of imaging data but is often limited by the difficulty in dynamic registration, slow image reconstruction, lack of real- time ability or the need for contrast agents. The goal of this proposal is to implement the recently released Microsoft HoloLens with fiber-based imaging techniques to dynamically augment tissue characteristics directly on the interrogated area in the surgeon’s field of view. The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: (1) To realize a prototype of the augmented reality visualization platform and to combine it with our fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) system, implement a user interface for a convenient interaction with the device. (2) To evaluate and optimize the scanning resolution and the registration precision using fluorescence phantoms and demonstrate the system in vivo for ten patients undergoing lumpectomy surgery. A current pilot study has demonstrated the potential of FLIm to localize tumor margins on excised breast specimen. The acquired in vivo data will help to systematically analyze differences between ex vivo and in vivo fluorescence decay signatures and provide initial data for a large-scale study that will be necessary to delineate tumor margins in vivo. The innovation of this proposal is that it will realize an augmented reality visualization platform for FLIm and other fiber based optical imaging modalities providing dynamic (continuous) augmentation of tissue properties directly on the interrogated area (surgeon’s field of view) in real-time without requiring the injection of contrast agents. The successful completion of this work has consequently the potential for significant impact in the field of surgical navigation. Project narrative This project seeks to realize an augmented and mixed reality visualization based on autofluorescence lifetime and any other fiber-based imaging technique for surgical navigation. The proposed research is consequently relevant to public health as it constitutes a critical part of surgical workflow to enable surgeon finding specific targets, avoiding areas of risk, and providing intraoperative orientation leading to higher resection precision and less interruptions in the surgical workflow.",Augmented reality visualization for intraoperative guidance based on fluorescence lifetime,9770855,R03EB026819,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biochemical', 'Breast', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Fiber Optics', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Situ', 'Infrastructure', 'Injections', 'Interruption', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modification', 'Near-infrared optical imaging', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Procedures', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'breast lumpectomy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'design and construction', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'mixed reality', 'optical imaging', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2019,74276,0.04470984091322142
"Intelligent Virtual Reality Curriculum for Personalized Surgical Training PROJECT SUMMARY The problems with current surgical training paradigms include the failure of opportunities for training to keep up with rising demands; surgeons in practice often have limited time and resources to practice, leading to risky usage of more complex technologies. Successful utilization of virtual reality (VR) in surgical training has led to the wide-spread adoption of such systems in General Surgery training programs; however, the focus on high-fidelity, near-real-life environments has made the methodology prohibitively expensive and inaccessible. This resource intensiveness has resulted in generalized VR modules that do not target specific procedures or skills. Considering the increasing number of new and complex devices coming onto the market and the direct link between volume of procedures and surgical expertise, the healthcare field must see a radical shift in the use of surgeon training technology in order to maximize quality training time before trainees enter the workforce. The current state of VR is ill-fit to be a true surgical training supplement as it cannot fulfil this need. Osso VR is developing a solution to this issue: The Smart Curriculum, a purposefully low-fidelity VR-based training curriculum that incorporates an artificial intelligence (AI) to adapt the session and curriculum to a trainee’s performance. A low-fidelity approach has been shown in pilot studies to have equal transfer rates compared to high-fidelity while being much less resource-intensive, thus making it ideal for broadening the accessibility of VR. An AI to customize a procedure to a surgeon’s performance and background will provide targeted practice to hone procedure familiarity and surgical skill. Thus, the combination of VR and AI will show increased transfer rates compared to classic VR paradigms at a fraction of the cost. Practicing surgical techniques on-demand with direct quantitative feedback plays an essential part in developing the needed expertise to a) improve the quality of the outcomes for patients and b) improve efficiency in the surgical technique thereby reducing the operating time. The work proposed in this Phase I project will focus on developing a proof-of-concept AI-incorporated module for the treatment of hip fractures with a cephalomedullary fixation device as a proof-of-concept. The proposed system will allow orthopedic surgeons to enhance their training in a virtual environment and predict the outcome of interventional decisions before actual surgery without any risks to the patients. The work plan for this Phase I SBIR project will be accomplished by first establishing all key subject matter and technical needs for the cephalomedullary fixation procedure to determine key learning milestones for a pilot procedure; second, we will determine the parameters for and wireframe the AI; finally, we will build necessary technical components for the prototype training module to validate the pilot procedure. Osso VR is the current leader in the field, and the addition of an AI component to individualize each surgeon’s training experience will be invaluable to revolutionizing the surgical training paradigm. The proposed project is a purposefully low-fidelity virtual-reality-based surgical training curriculum that incorporates an artificial intelligence to adapt the session and curriculum to a trainee’s performance. This technology will provide new surgeons with targeted practice to hone their procedural familiarity and surgical skill to improve proficiency, thus reducing training costs and operating time, and improving surgical outcomes for patients.",Intelligent Virtual Reality Curriculum for Personalized Surgical Training,9778500,R43EB028203,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Controlled Environment', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Healthcare', 'Hip Fractures', 'Industry', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Movement', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Transferable Skills', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'improved', 'innovation', 'outcome prediction', 'pedagogy', 'prototype', 'rehearsal', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NIBIB,"OSSO VR, INC.",R43,2019,215545,0.1309023467810135
"Molecular guided surgery for enhanced resection of solid tumors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to facilitate the candidate's transition to a role as a leading academic researcher and multidisciplinary team member developing optical fluorescence-based technology, with the goal of improving extent of tumor resection (EOTR) in brain cancer. In particular, a focus of this proposal is on advancing fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) within the context of neurosurgical oncology.

"Objective assessment of surgical competence in a septoplasty model DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To ensure patient safety, educators must train surgeons to set standards of competency, public health officials should put in place policies to ensure surgeons remain competent and surgeons should only perform surgeries that they are competent to perform. Measuring surgeon's technical skill is crucial part of determining if they are competent. Traditionally surgical skill is assessed most commonly during training using subjective non-validated metrics. This leads to variation in the definition of competency. Recent policies set forth by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education- the governing body for graduate medical education, mandate that technical skill be measured objectively. Currently, there are few valid objective measures available to measure technical competence. Our research will yield a set of tools and methodologies that can be deployed to across medical training programs to objectively measure surgical skill and competence. This platform is also capable of developing new objective measure of skill and competence. Specifically, first, we will develop an objective skills assessment platform, and establish standard data collection and quality assurance protocols for systematic deployment of our platform across multiple institutions. Second, our work will result in automated algorithms and analytic tools to objectivel measure skill using data captured with our platform. Third, we will establish objective methods to determine whether a surgeon is competent to perform surgery. Fourth, we will test the reliability and validity of our assessment tools. We will conduct our study using septoplasty as the prototype test-bed procedure. Septoplasty is a commonly performed procedure (more than 260,000 cases per year) and is a key index surgery by which residents in otolaryngology are evaluated. Our project lays the groundwork for subsequent research to establish national standards for objective skill and competency using data aggregated from numerous training programs in the country. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Policies for graduate medical education require that surgical competency be objectively determined, but currently available technology and methods do not yield objective assessments for surgical skill. Our project aims to provide educators with an integrated objective skills assessment platform and tools for objective determination of competency, which can be readily deployed across graduate surgical training programs in the country.",Objective assessment of surgical competence in a septoplasty model,9751078,R01DE025265,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Beds', 'Cessation of life', 'Competence', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging', 'Foundations', 'Inferior', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Residencies', 'Site', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Validity of Results', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'graduate medical education', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'inter-institutional', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,464082,0.12624932234771682
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas PROJECT SUMMARY Meningiomas, which arise from arachnoid cells, make up >1/3 of all intracranial tumors. While typically benign, these tumors induce clinical symptoms due to mass effect and peritumoral edema. In cases requiring intervention, gross total resection provides the best outcomes when possible. However, treatment strategy is ultimately decided by determining the proper balance between surgical difficulty and the patient's overall health. Two mechanical properties are important predictors of surgical difficulty: tumor stiffness and adherence to surrounding tissues. Knowledge of these properties before surgery would allow clinicians to more accurately assess surgical risk and identify the most effective treatment strategy. Mechanical properties are difficult to predict by conventional imaging approaches, but can be directly assessed by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and related Slip Interface Imaging (SII). In published studies, we have shown that MRE-based stiffness estimates are significantly correlated with tumor stiffness in meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Furthermore, SII accurately predicted tumor adherence in meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. Still, challenges remain to make these findings clinically-impactful. For estimating stiffness, the primary limitation lies in resolution. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will develop a voxel- wise classifier of tumor stiffness. This aim will build on our recently published neural network-based inversion (NNI), which has demonstrated superior performance to conventional direct inversions in simulation and in the brain. In Aim 1a, we will advance NNI by implementing more complex neural network architectures and creating more realistic simulations for training. In Aim 1b, the advances will be validated in a phantom with inhomogeneous stiffness. Finally, in Aim 1c with the aid of our Neurosurgery collaborators, we will collect a large sample of surgical stiffness assessments. We will use these assessments to train a voxel-wise stiffness classifier, which will then be validated in a separate test set. This aim will result in a map that conveys both stiffness and confidence in the prediction on a scale that is clinically meaningful to surgeons. The most-pressing limitations in SII include the subjective interpretation of the images and the lack of spatially resolved predictions. Aim 2 will address these challenges by developing a voxel-wise slip interface classifier. In Aim 2a, we will investigate a neural network-based predictor of slip interfaces to add to our current methods. In Aim 2b, we will evaluate if this new method can improve predictions in phantom experiments. In Aim 2c, we will again leverage surgical assessments of meningioma adherence to train and test a voxel-wise classifier. The result of this aim will be a map of tumor adherence represented as an easily interpreted probability. Taken together, these aims will provide neurosurgeons with clinically-important information to improve patient management. More broadly, technical advances made in this project will impact the entire MRE field. PROJECT NARRATIVE Meningiomas are the most common type of intracranial tumor and are best treated by total resection when possible. The mechanical properties of these tumors are important factors in surgical difficulty, where soft, non- adherent tumors are more easily removed that firm or adherent tumors. This project will use Magnetic Resonance Elastography and related Slip Interface Imaging to directly measure these properties, providing new clinically-important information to neurosurgeons and patients.",Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas,9755633,R01EB027064,"['Acoustic Neuroma', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Arachnoid mater', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Skull Base Neoplasms', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'mechanical properties', 'meningioma', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neurosurgery', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,357750,0.05249214795440077
"4D ventricle-valve model risk stratification for planning surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation Project Summary/Abstract Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a disease where the normal mitral valve (MV) structure is dysfunctional due to left ventricular (LV) remodeling after a myocardial infarction (MI). IMR affects nearly 3 million Americans and the magnitude of this problem is expected to grow as the population ages. IMR has a substantial mortality rate that is associated with even mild MR severity. Mitral valve repair with undersized ring annuloplasty has been the preferred treatment strategy for IMR; however, the recurrence of moderate or severe IMR within 12 months of surgery is common. Recent high profile results from the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) mul- ticenter randomized trials on IMR have confirmed a high incidence of early recurrent IMR. More importantly, these studies highlighted the adverse impact of recurrent IMR on LV remodeling and clinical outcomes. The CTSN trials demonstrated no significant difference in LV volume reduction or survival at 12 and 24 months between repair and replacement groups; however, subgroup analysis demonstrated that repair patients that developed recurrent IMR had no reduction in LV volume while repair patients without recurrence experienced LV volume reduction that was superior to patients having valve replacement. The results of the CTSN IMR trials indicate an unmet need for a pre-operative risk stratification tool that reliably predicts MV repair failure. Such a tool would significantly reduce the problem of recurrent IMR by performing valve repair only in patients likely to experience a durable result and performing valve replacement in patients with high risk of recurrence. The long term goal is to improve quality of surgical therapy in IMR by improving risk-stratification pre-operatively using image analysis tools. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve the prediction IMR recurrence by ex- panding this model to include the left ventricle (LV). The rationale is that while IMR manifests as MV malcoapta- tion, the root cause of the disease is LV remodeling. The central hypothesis is that features extracted from the integrated left ventricular and mitral valve (LVMV) model will predict recurrence more accurately than the current MV-only model. To fulfill this objective and test the central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Develop the 4D integrated LVMV model and compare the accuracy of fitting this model to intraoperative 3DTE images to that of the existing MV-only model. 2) Assess the ability of biomarkers derived from the integrated LVMV model to predict IMR recurrence, and compare to the predictive value of the MV-only model. The project is significant because, if successful, the integrated LVMV model will be incorporated into the Gorman lab ongoing effort translating this technology to the operating room, thus improving survival rates, reducing the impending clinical burden and the number of repeated procedures. Project Narrative The proposed project tackles the high impact problem of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) recurrence after surgical repair by developing a reliable real-time pre-operative risk stratification tool using image analysis of 3D transesophageal echocardiography. This will enable surgeons to optimize mitral surgical treatment in IMR on a case-by-case basis. If successful, the proposed research has the potential to virtually eliminate the problem of IMR recurrence, maximize long-term outcomes for millions of IMR patients and significantly decrease the im- pending clinical burden expected with an aging population.",4D ventricle-valve model risk stratification for planning surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation,9754718,F30HL142138,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Label', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Mitral Valve', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Transesophageal Echocardiography', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'aging population', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinically translatable', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'morphometry', 'mortality', 'muscular structure', 'papillary muscle', 'randomized trial', 'repaired', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'valve replacement', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2019,32081,0.05827719316653833
"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients. Through this academic-industrial partnership of successful collaborators, we aim to accumulate data which will propel this emerging technology towards becoming the new standard of care for intraoperative histology.",Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology,9980576,R01CA226527,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Freezing', 'Frozen Sections', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Histologic', 'Histological Techniques', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical translation', 'college', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'graphical user interface', 'histological image', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'standard of care', 'virtual']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,524967,0.08602450697126503
"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,9840235,R01NS110347,"['Ablation', 'Anterior Temporal Lobectomy', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Common Data Element', 'Contralateral', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Freedom', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Publishing', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'millimeter', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,696066,0.12581278037340896
"Interictal high frequency oscillations as non-invasive biomarkers of epileptogenicity in pediatric patients Project Summary Crucial to the success of epilepsy surgery is the availability of a robust presurgical biomarker to identify the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Complete resection of the EZ may lead to medication and seizure freedom. Since the EZ cannot be measured directly, its location is estimated indirectly based on concordant data from a multitude of noninvasive tests. Yet, the results of these tests are often insufficiently concordant or inconclusive. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) serves as the gold standard for the delineation of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). However, the SOZ does not always predict the surgical outcome, and its delineation requires many days of recordings to capture clinical seizures. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs), recorded with iEEG are promising interictal biomarkers of the EZ. Yet, their clinical value for epilepsy surgery is still debated since the HFO-generating area is often relatively large and its complete resection may overlap with eloquent areas. This is often attributed to the presence of physiological HFOs in non-epileptogenic areas. In our recent iEEG study, we showed that interictal HFOs are initiated by an onset generator and spread to other brain areas over time. This generator constitutes a promising interictal biomarker of the EZ since its resection is associated with good surgical outcome. Despite the copious literature on HFOs, the clinical value of HFOs for surgery has been only investigated using iEEG, which presents serious limitations due to its invasiveness and its limited spatial sampling. This application aims to noninvasively localize interictal HFOs with high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs, and assess the noninvasive localization of the HFO-onset generator with respect to the surgical resection and patients’ outcome. Our hypothesis is that HD-EEG and MEG can distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs non-invasively and can localize the HFO-onset generator whose removal leads to better surgical outcome than the removal of the area of secondary spread. To test our hypothesis, we specifically aim to: (i) assess the ability of HD-EEG and MEG to localize HFOs; (ii) differentiate physiological (nHFOs) from pathological (pHFOs) HFOs using unsupervised machine learning; (iii) localize noninvasively the HFO-onset generator and compare it with the clinical gold standard for resection tailoring, i.e. the iEEG-defined SOZ; and (iv) assess the predictive value of the HFO- onset generator in terms of surgical outcome. To pursue these aims, we will record HD-EEG and MEG data from 50 children (0-18 years old) with MRE and 50 typically developing (TD) children. This application combines the use of cutting-edge pediatric neuroimaging instruments, 3D printing technology, and innovative signal processing tools together with extensive neuroimaging experience with children. Our research will have a direct impact on the life of children with MRE since it will provide a new noninvasive biomarker of the EZ that would limit invasive long-term monitoring, augment presurgical planning, and improve the surgical outcome. Narrative To lessen the negative impact of medically refractory epilepsy in children, a new pre-surgical noninvasive biomarker that identifies reliably the area of the brain that generates the epileptic seizures is essential. The proposed experiments are relevant to public health because they may lead to a significant improvement of the presurgical evaluation procedure and postsurgical outcome of pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. The project is relevant to NINDS’s mission because the resulting findings could significantly improve the quality of life in children with epilepsy, one of the most common pediatric neurological disorders, which has a major impact on children’s development and may significantly affect their adult life.",Interictal high frequency oscillations as non-invasive biomarkers of epileptogenicity in pediatric patients,9816907,R01NS104116,"['18 year old', '3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Head', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'blind', 'density', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'signal processing', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,3384,0.028149447709764904
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,9660276,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity -

"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale. Different from previously proposed metrics, our approach evaluates the entire shape as a whole. With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients. Additionally, surgeons will be able to better communicate with each other and study the effects of surgical intervention on their patients which will improve patient care in the long run.",Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis,9778826,R21EB026061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Applications Grants', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye Abnormalities', 'Forehead', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Headache', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Socialization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereophotogrammetries', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Trauma patient', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'neural network', 'operation', 'patient stratification', 'power analysis', 'premature', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'self esteem', 'shape analysis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'web-based tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,307172,0.047391113445695424
"A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to improve our ability to create and measure 3D models derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Our main motivation is to improve quality and reduce costs in care of patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities. The resulted innovations will also impact other fields. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffered from CMF deformities. The evaluation of these patients includes an assessment of CMF form on 3D models that are traditionally generated from segmented spiral multi-slice CTs (MSCTs). These models are also used to plan their treatment. The purpose of segmentation is to separate different anatomical structures and to remove the artifacts on the CTs. Once 3D models are generated from the segmented CTs, anatomical and teeth landmarks are manually digitized for measurements. Finally, diagnosis and treatment planning are performed based on measurements. Although MSCT provides high- quality images and thus allows relatively fast and easy post processing, many concerns have been raised on excessive radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, more doctors are now using CBCT scanners in their offices. CBCT has less radiation and is inexpensive compared to the MSCT, but their use in generating 3D models is greatly limited by the poor image quality, i.e., low contrast / signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts. Thus, the existing automated segmentation algorithms developed for MSCT are incapable of practically segmenting CBCTs. The current solution to CBCT segmentation entails an arduous and lengthy process that involves labor-intensive manual editing of hundreds of slices. Besides, another arduous and inaccurate task in the assessment of CMF deformities is the digitization of anatomical landmarks on 3D models - the first step to quantify the deformities. Currently a typical 3D cephalometric and teeth analysis requires the manual digitization of more than 200 landmarks, which is time consuming and has limited accuracy. We hypothesize that the creation and measurement of high-quality 3D models can be significantly improved by developing innovative CBCT-friendly post processing tools. Therefore, in this renewal project, we propose to develop and validate a novel CBCT analysis platform to automate the process of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization. The feasibility of our approaches has already been proven by our preliminary studies. Our innovative CBCT analysis platform will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals with CMF conditions. It will change our dental/CMF fields in effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for on-the-fly diagnosis and treatment planning. With minimal user intervention, the computer will accurately and effectively do the work, which is currently artistically done by the labor-intensive human operators. The resulted innovations may also impact other fields in the future, e.g., orthopedic surgery and cardiovascular surgery where intraoperative whole-body CBCT is acquired for image-guided surgery and intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in physician's offices for orthodontics, craniomaxillofacial (CMF) surgery, facial plastic surgery and dentistry, but its segmentation and landmark digitization have to be completed artistically by human operators, which is labor-intensive and with limited accuracy.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative CBCT post processing system to automate the processes of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization with minimal user intervention.  The proposed system will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals  with CMF conditions, and also change 1) the fields of orthodontics, CMF surgery and general dentistry in  effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for diagnosis and treatment planning, and 2) the fields of orthopedic  surgery, general surgery, and cardiovascular surgery where the quality and the speed of intraoperative  imaging is critical.",A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities,9624752,R01DE022676,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Deformity', 'Dental Care', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Jaw', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Orthodontics', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'design', 'detector', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,490358,0.05540509911029998
"Development of a computer-guided orthopedic laser surgical system – vision & measurement Spatial Surgical is developing a novel, first-in-class orthopedic laser system that rapidly and safely ablates soft tissue and bone through a single handpiece. Spatial’s technology couples a laser with a real-time digital video system to offer computer-guided surgery that stands to replace traditional orthopedic saws, drills, and cauterization tools. The digital 3D video system is two miniaturized CMOS-based cameras built into the laser hand- piece. By eliminating mechanical tools an unobstructed, intra-operative view of the surgical site is possible for the first time ever. In-between the laser pulses, the cameras flash to capture an unobstructed view of the surgical site. The dual cameras are connected to a 3D display. Advances in autostereoscopic 3D displays have eliminated the need for 3D glasses, referred to as “glasses-free”, and enabled wide angle viewing. 3D viewing of the surgical area promotes increased spatial understanding of complex/ambiguous scenes and enhances surgical efficiency (McIntire 2014). Coupling image recognition software with the 3D vision enables AI measurement and computer assisted navigation. Orthopedic surgical success, measured as less patient pain and fewer revisions, has been shown when measurement and navigation are used, but existing systems are expensive and slow. A laser surgical hand-piece coupled with HD 3D vision and measurement will enable more accurate implant placement and restored range of motion while reducing infections and decreasing surgical times. This SBIR program models, tests, and demonstrates 3D viewing including digital zoom. Initially a multi-element design is modeled to predict what lens assembles would match with the digital CMOS imager appropriate for the orthopedic HD 3D application. Secondly off-the-shelf, OTS, lens stacks are chosen based on the optical modeling, and are tested to define the balance between the FOV, focal length, object distance and image size. Lens stack stereo characteristics are recorded and subsequently derive the forward-looking design requirements. Additionally, various illumination levels are explored to determine the optimum lighting for each lens stack. A standard vision calibration chart, like Mil-Std-150A, is used for alignment and the edge response is used to define spatial resolution. Multiple bone cut samples are measured with a confocal microscope and then viewed in 2D with the various OTS lens stacks. Optical measurement software is used to process the OTS lens camera images and are graphed versus the microscope data to determine peak image performance for spatial resolution. The introduction of HD autostereoscopic monitors and high pixel count CMOS global imagers enable a 3D surgical vision system to aid in orthopedic surgical applications by providing 3D glasses-free and wide angle viewing to improve spatial understanding of joints for faster and more precise surgery.",Development of a computer-guided orthopedic laser surgical system – vision & measurement,9846664,R43AR075447,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Budgets', 'Calibration', 'Cauterize', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Surgery', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Fracture', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Implantation procedure', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'base', 'bone', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'lens', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'preservation', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'solid state', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAMS,SPATIAL SURGICAL LLC,R43,2019,246510,0.09660422861397218
"Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data Project Summary/Abstract Surgical operations can put patients at high risk of infections and other complications. However, studies have shown that half or more of surgical infections are discovered after hospital discharge. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) began in 2005 with the goal of assisting hospitals with identifying and preventing surgical complications. Each participating ACS NSQIP hospital assigns a surgical clinical nurse reviewer to collect preoperative through 30-day postoperative data on a sample of surgical patients in order to risk adjust postoperative complications so that they can be compared across participating hospitals. Although at large volume hospitals these samples might represent only 10-15% of all surgical cases, these data are considered to be the current gold standard for accurate identification and comparison of postoperative complications. Unfortunately, chart review is time-consuming and costly and, as a result, cannot be scaled up easily to cover all surgical patients. The goal of this project is to learn from the ACS NSQIP data in order to develop electronic algorithms for identifying postoperative infections that can be scaled up easily and inexpensively. Development of such algorithms will also permit evaluation of interventions that intend to impact large populations of patients at risk of postoperative infections. Considering the large number of available binary classification algorithms for data mining that are easy to implement, it is paramount to consider new methods for identifying surgical infections electronically. Furthermore, postoperative infections are rare, and occur in about 7% of operated patients; therefore, it is difficult to identify models that classify infections well. Sampling techniques are commonly used in conjunction with classification models in order to improve sensitivity and positive predictive value. We believe that modern statistical techniques for classification combined with strategic sampling, and the use of ICD9 and ICD10 codes and pharmacy data, will improve upon existing methods for electronically identifying postoperative infections. The aims of this proposal are (1a) to develop algorithms for identifying surgical infections using machine learning techniques, (1b) to develop models for specific types of postoperative infections collected in the ACS NSQIP data separately, which include SSI, urinary tract infection, pneumonia and sepsis and (2) to validate these models in prospective ACS NSQIP data. Project Narrative In this application, we propose to use outcomes data from the University of Colorado American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program combined with electronic health record and administrative claims data in order to develop models for identifying postoperative infections electronically. These infections are currently identified through manual chart review, and it is our hope that successful development of these models could replace costly, time-consuming manual chart review. We will use machine learning and sampling techniques to achieve better performance than models previously reported in the literature.",Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data,9681394,R03HS026019,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2019,51181,0.11267695488719649
"Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning Abstract: Our main clinical objective for this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities by significantly improving the surgical planning method. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffer from CMF deformities. The basic principles of CMF surgery involve the restoration of deformed CMF structures back to normal anatomy and functions with osteotomy, autologous, bone grafts, or vascularized free flaps. The success of CMF surgery depends on not only the technical aspects of the operation, but also, to a large extent, the precise formulation of a surgical plan. However, CMF surgical planning is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of CMF anatomy and deformity. During a routine CMF surgical planning, a surgeon first acquires a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull. He then performs 3D cephalometric analysis to quantify the deformity. Finally, the surgery is simulated by virtually cutting the 3D model into multiple bony segments. The surgeon then tries his best to move and rotate each segment individually to a desired position within the normal range of cephalometric values (the current standard of care). This is problematic as “normal” cephalometric values are the averageness of normal population, in which each value has a mean and a standard deviation. Due to the variation within the normal values, the surgeon must often guess what the exact value the patient's cephalometric measurement should be corrected to. In addition, cephalometry is a group of only linear and angular measurements, which certainly cannot represent the complex nature of human CMF structures. Therefore, surgical outcomes are often subjective and heavily dependent on the surgeons' experience and artistic talent. Because each human face is different, the average “normal values” cannot represent the complex morphology of each individual face. To this end, we hypothesize that if a surgeon can foresee what the normal CMF shape of the patient should be, the surgical plan will be objective and personalized. Therefore, in this project, we propose developing and validating a new surgical planning method of using patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models. The feasibility of our approach has already been proven by our preliminary studies. The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively. The results will be especially beneficial to patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic craniofacial deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer. In the future, our approach can also be used to design and print 3D patient-specific resorbable bone implants with tissue engineering capability for bone regeneration. Project Narrative:  The current standard of care of making treatment plan for patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF)  deformities is cephalometric analysis, including a group of linear and angular measurements, which  cannot represent the complex morphology of human CMF facial structures.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative shape-based surgical planning method of using  patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models, for replacing the current subjective  cephalometric method.  The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing  personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively, which is especially beneficial  to the patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer.",Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning,9720682,R01DE027251,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Autologous', 'Back', 'Bilateral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Head', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'operation', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'psychologic', 'restoration', 'simulation', 'skull base', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,585464,0.15108716131717215
"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9753639,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2019,7220733,0.06284713247067134
"Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CANDIDATE (Andrew J. Hung, MD): My long-term goal is to establish a career in innovating training methods for robotic surgery which will lead to curtailing surgeon learning curve, and maximize patient safety. My first step towards that goal focuses on understanding objective metrics that measure surgeon performance, and how machine learning algorithms can process that data to guide training. I have developed a career development program that builds on my clinical training in robotic urologic surgery and prior research in surgical training. Through mentorship, a fellowship, and formal coursework, this K23 award will provide me the necessary support to develop expertise in 3 areas where I do not have formal training, yet are critical to my success: (1) Machine learning; (2) Surgical education; (3) Advanced statistical skills and study design. MENTORING TEAM: My career development and research plans leverage existing institutional resources, including the USC Machine Learning Center, led by co-primary mentor Dr. Yan Liu; and Keck Hospital of USC, the second busiest robotic center by volume in the United States and the USC Institute of Urology (led by co- primary mentor and chairman Dr. Inderbir Gill), home to pioneers of several urologic surgical techniques with a robust research apparatus supporting several NIH-funded clinical scientists. My mentoring team is complemented by co-mentor Dr. Robert Sweet, a DOD-funded expert on surgical education; career mentor Dr. Larissa Rodriguez, a federally funded clinician/scientist experienced in mentoring K awardees; educational psychology collaborator Dr. Kenneth Yates, an authority on cognitive task analysis; and consultant Dr. Anthony Jarc, at Intuitive Surgical who has supported much of the pilot data on objective performance metrics. The proposed K23 work truly requires the robust collaboration of experts in robotic surgery, education, and machine learning. RESEARCH: The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is steep: over 100 cases. Current ‘gold standard’ methods of surgical assessment rely on subjective expert review, but such evaluations are time consuming and inconsistent. Nonetheless, credentialing a surgeon to perform robotic surgery has enormous implications - patient outcomes are at risk, and a surgeon’s career is on the line. Informed by my clinical expertise in robotic urological surgery and preliminary data, I will develop a novel method of utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to objectively assess robotic surgeon performance and to guide training for the vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA), the most critical reconstructive part of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). I will develop and validate objective metrics directly captured from the da Vinci robot during the VUA (Aim 1), train machine learning algorithms to assess a surgeon’s performance of VUA (Aim 2), and utilize ML algorithms to guide surgeons learning the VUA (Aim 3). Armed with these data and skills from this award, I will be uniquely suited to utilize machine learning to generalize objective surgeon assessment for robot-assisted surgical procedures within and beyond urology. Finally, the results from this study will provide preliminary data for independent funding through mechanisms such as an NIH R01 grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer is steep, and current methods of evaluating surgeons require subjective and time-consuming expert review. Streamlined training and assessment utilizing objective performance metrics and machine learning algorithms can significantly curtail learning curve with patients, and decrease the overall morbidity of prostate cancer treatment.",Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy,9581712,K23EB026493,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Chairperson', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Credentialing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational Psychology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urethra', 'Urologic Surgical Procedures', 'Urology', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive task', 'common treatment', 'computer program', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'male', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'peer', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'robot assistance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'task analysis', 'urologic', 'virtual reality']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K23,2018,193846,0.0528508391144663
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9535033,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,460052,0.035333455835604155
"Patient specific 3D printed tissue engineered vascular graft for aortic reconstruction designed by artificial intelligence algorithm. 1 The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered  2 vascular grafts (TEVG) for use in aortic arch repair surgery. These TEVGs are optimized for high pressure  3 circulation using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence, and will grow with the patient, in hopes of  4 obviating need for future surgeries to replace grafts, which can occur with contemporary arch reconstruction  5 materials. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death due to congenital anomalies. Despite  6 significant advances in surgical management for CHD, one significant source of morbidity and mortality arises  7 from the complexity of surgery for diverse anatomies in the aortic arch. Previous studies have demonstrated  8 that the resultant arch geometry after surgical reconstruction of stenotic or hypoplastic aortas is important to  9 minimize reduce energy loss and undesirable flow inside the arch, which can lead to hypertension, abnormal 10 vascular response and ventricular dysfunction. Ensuring a patient-specific graft design for ideal reconstructed 11 route before surgery with minimum energy loss and wall shear stress may yield long-term benefits for patient 12 health and quality of life. 13 We have demonstrated native vessel like neotissue formation of TEVG in small and large animal 14 studies. Based on these experiences, we have developed a novel 3D printing technology combining 3D printed 15 metal mandrels with nanofiber electro-spun technology. With this 3D printing technology, we showed that 16 TEVG developed native like neovessel formation in venous circulation in a sheep model. For this next step, we 17 aim to develop grafts in arterial circulation that can be applied to aortic reconstruction. We will also develop 18 automatic design algorithms to design optimal graft shape in order to reduce time and cost of patient specific 19 design. We hypothesize that patient-specific TEVG using our 3D printing technology can be designed, 20 aided by pre-operative imaging and flow data, computer assisted design (CAD), automatic design 21 algorithms based on computation fluid dynamics (CFD) results, and will demonstrate proper neotissue 22 formation and growth while maintaining optimally designed hemodynamics. 23 This project will be an important step towards clinical application of patient-specific vascular grafts that 24 recapitulate the native anatomy and mechanical properties. The results of this work will have a broader impact 25 on the design and fabrication of other more complex cardiovascular structures for implantation. This paradigm 26 shift in vascular graft technology will improve the quality and safety of pediatric patient care. The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered vascular grafts using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence for use in aortic arch repair surgery which demands a structured surgical approach in order to optimize hemodynamics postoperatively. We will optimize the design of an aortic graft automatically using computational flow dynamics, refine 3D printing manufacturing, evaluate grafts with in-vitro testing, and finally will test the performance of the grafts in vivo over time.

"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides2. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens5-7, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients. Through this academic-industrial partnership of successful collaborators, we aim to accumulate data which will propel this emerging technology towards becoming the new standard of care for intraoperative histology.",Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology,9498251,R01CA226527,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Freezing', 'Frozen Sections', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Histologic', 'Histological Techniques', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical translation', 'college', 'computer science', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'graphical user interface', 'histological image', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'standard of care', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,529945,0.08602450697126503
"Enabling Technology for Safe Robot-assisted Surgical Micromanipulation Project Summary  The goal of this grant is to develop enabling technology and systems that address fundamental limitations in microsurgery with a specific focus on vitreoretinal surgery. Due to the inherent micro-scale and the fragility of the neurosensory retina, vitreoretinal surgeons can be challenged by physiological hand tremor where the tremor amplitude is larger than retinal structures, delicate movements that are below tactile sensation, and multiple cognitive decisions that are required when executing high-risk movements, such as during retinal vein cannulation (RVC). Nevertheless currently vitreoretinal surgery is at the limits of human physiological performance and lacks the adequate technology that could further improve the technical performance. This situation is less than optimal and can significantly benefit from the recent advances in medical robotics, sensor feedback and human machine interface design. Robotic assistance may be ideally suited to address common problems encountered in the performance of the demanding micromanipulations in retinal microsurgery.  We propose a robotic system with enhanced real-time multisensory feedback that assesses multiple points of instrument contact located both inside and outside of the eye. Our comprehensive system will enable the surgeon to manipulate tools based on quantitative feedback that will prevent mechanical injury by implementing safeguards against the application of excessive and previously unmeasurable forces at the eyewall and the tool tip. Our aims are: (1) Develop and demonstrate in vivo position/force hybrid control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy for safe robot-assisted vitreoretinal microsurgery: real-time sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy will be uniquely used to control the robot through a machine learning method that adaptively learns a nonlinear mapping from user behavior to sclera-force/position and predicts unsafe motions; (2) Develop and demonstrate in vivo force-input control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the tool-tip for safe robot-assisted vein cannulation: real-time tool- tip-to-tissue interaction force sensing and non-linear robot control algorithms based on observing the user behavior will be used to control the tool-tip position and force and to prevent entry into subretinal areas during RVC; (3) Demonstrate safe robot-assisted RVC in rabbit model in vivo: real-time, position/force hybrid control algorithms based on dual-point (tool-shaft and tip) information fusion will provide sensorimotor guidance of surgical maneuvers during RVC. Statistically significant results in vivo, in clinically realistic conditions will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.  This highly innovative system will enable surgeons to perform maneuvers in a tremor free environment with a higher level of precision than previously possible and with the ability to sense forces on a scale that have been previously imperceptible. We envision this development as a logical next step in the integration of man, machine and computer for the performance of unprecedented microsurgical maneuvers. Project Narrative  This R01 grant addresses fundamental limitations in current microsurgical practice, focusing on vitreoretinal surgery (VRS), which is the most technically demanding ophthalmologic surgery. Our goal is to develop a cooperatively controlled robotic system with enhanced sensorimotor capabilities that in conjunction with multifunction force-sensing microsurgical instruments could enable safe robot-assisted retinal surgery. Although focused on VRS, our results will be applicable to a broader range of microsurgical training and practice.",Enabling Technology for Safe Robot-assisted Surgical Micromanipulation,9449437,R01EB023943,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Cannulations', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Micromanipulation', 'Microsurgery', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Retinal Perforations', 'Retinal Vein Occlusion', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sclera', 'Site', 'Sterilization', 'Structure', 'Structure of central vein of the retina', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Veins', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'design', 'dexterity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'medical specialties', 'multisensory', 'neurosensory', 'neurosurgery', 'operation', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'trend', 'virtual']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,356307,0.06717216757099478
"Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants Impressive advances in cochlear implant (CI) technology in recent years have placed within our grasp the possibility of developing spoken language. However, one remaining question is why CI children as a group still perform below their normal-hearing peers and why performance varies across individuals. In searching for the sources of language development variability in young CI children, our proposed study will also seek to construct clinically useful models that capitalize on pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures for predicting post-surgical language development outcomes at the individual level. At the Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, we have collected pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures and post-surgical speech outcome data from about 130 (70 prospectively and 60 retrospectively) subjects over the past five years. We also conducted a preliminary study that demonstrates that individual patients can be classified into better or poorer language improvers six months post-surgery by a machine-learning algorithm that makes predictions based on neuroanatomical measures established pre-surgery. Our proposed study will seek to extend this preliminary research by: (1) continuing data collection and analyzing a larger set of neural measures and outcome data up to two years post-surgery, and (2) testing the generalizability of the predictive models built in Chicago to CI patients of similar characteristics at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Michigan in order to evaluate the models' broader clinical utility. Our studies will be constructed to test two competing hypotheses. The neural preservation hypothesis postulates that brain regions that are unaffected by hearing loss contribute most to language development outcomes, and that they most likely encompass auditory association areas and cognitive brain regions. The neural cycling hypothesis argues that post-surgical language development relies on the recovery of the brain regions that are most affected by hearing loss, most likely in the primary auditory cortical regions. If successful, our predictive models could immediately be deployed to augment current clinical practice, because they concern patient outcome at the individual level. Ultimately, our predictive information will allow clinicians and parents to plan more carefully for post-surgical therapy and to identify personalized management strategies for individual children. Our study directly addresses Priority Area 3 in Hearing and Balance Research of the latest NIDCD Strategic Plan.     Although cochlear implants have allowed better spoken language development in early-deafened children, the language and cognitive abilities of these children continue to lag behind those of their normal-hearing peers. The proposed study will seek to use pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures to predict post-surgical language outcomes in young children who have received a CI in order to assist in better post-surgical planning and the optimization of therapy.    ",Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants,9445282,R21DC016069,"['4 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Equilibrium', 'Fiber', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recycling', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Strategic Planning', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Surgical Management', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'auditory deprivation', 'auditory pathway', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cognitive ability', 'grasp', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'neural model', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'personalized management', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'treatment optimization']",NIDCD,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,R21,2018,245338,0.00732187866007154
"Augmented reality visualization for intraoperative guidance based on fluorescence lifetime Project summary/Abstract Optical imaging techniques have demonstrated potential to delineate tumor margins in vivo during surgery as they can rapidly characterize structural, biochemical or functional properties of tissue. Implementation in clinical practice demands rapid visualization and augmentation of imaging data but is often limited by the difficulty in dynamic registration, slow image reconstruction, lack of real- time ability or the need for contrast agents. The goal of this proposal is to implement the recently released Microsoft HoloLens with fiber-based imaging techniques to dynamically augment tissue characteristics directly on the interrogated area in the surgeon’s field of view. The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: (1) To realize a prototype of the augmented reality visualization platform and to combine it with our fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) system, implement a user interface for a convenient interaction with the device. (2) To evaluate and optimize the scanning resolution and the registration precision using fluorescence phantoms and demonstrate the system in vivo for ten patients undergoing lumpectomy surgery. A current pilot study has demonstrated the potential of FLIm to localize tumor margins on excised breast specimen. The acquired in vivo data will help to systematically analyze differences between ex vivo and in vivo fluorescence decay signatures and provide initial data for a large-scale study that will be necessary to delineate tumor margins in vivo. The innovation of this proposal is that it will realize an augmented reality visualization platform for FLIm and other fiber based optical imaging modalities providing dynamic (continuous) augmentation of tissue properties directly on the interrogated area (surgeon’s field of view) in real-time without requiring the injection of contrast agents. The successful completion of this work has consequently the potential for significant impact in the field of surgical navigation. Project narrative This project seeks to realize an augmented and mixed reality visualization based on autofluorescence lifetime and any other fiber-based imaging technique for surgical navigation. The proposed research is consequently relevant to public health as it constitutes a critical part of surgical workflow to enable surgeon finding specific targets, avoiding areas of risk, and providing intraoperative orientation leading to higher resection precision and less interruptions in the surgical workflow.",Augmented reality visualization for intraoperative guidance based on fluorescence lifetime,9585701,R03EB026819,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biochemical', 'Breast', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Fiber Optics', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Situ', 'Injections', 'Interruption', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modification', 'Near-infrared optical imaging', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'breast lumpectomy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'design and construction', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'optical imaging', 'prototype', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2018,62883,0.04470984091322142
"Objective assessment of surgical competence in a septoplasty model DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To ensure patient safety, educators must train surgeons to set standards of competency, public health officials should put in place policies to ensure surgeons remain competent and surgeons should only perform surgeries that they are competent to perform. Measuring surgeon's technical skill is crucial part of determining if they are competent. Traditionally surgical skill is assessed most commonly during training using subjective non-validated metrics. This leads to variation in the definition of competency. Recent policies set forth by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education- the governing body for graduate medical education, mandate that technical skill be measured objectively. Currently, there are few valid objective measures available to measure technical competence. Our research will yield a set of tools and methodologies that can be deployed to across medical training programs to objectively measure surgical skill and competence. This platform is also capable of developing new objective measure of skill and competence. Specifically, first, we will develop an objective skills assessment platform, and establish standard data collection and quality assurance protocols for systematic deployment of our platform across multiple institutions. Second, our work will result in automated algorithms and analytic tools to objectivel measure skill using data captured with our platform. Third, we will establish objective methods to determine whether a surgeon is competent to perform surgery. Fourth, we will test the reliability and validity of our assessment tools. We will conduct our study using septoplasty as the prototype test-bed procedure. Septoplasty is a commonly performed procedure (more than 260,000 cases per year) and is a key index surgery by which residents in otolaryngology are evaluated. Our project lays the groundwork for subsequent research to establish national standards for objective skill and competency using data aggregated from numerous training programs in the country. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Policies for graduate medical education require that surgical competency be objectively determined, but currently available technology and methods do not yield objective assessments for surgical skill. Our project aims to provide educators with an integrated objective skills assessment platform and tools for objective determination of competency, which can be readily deployed across graduate surgical training programs in the country.",Objective assessment of surgical competence in a septoplasty model,9526465,R01DE025265,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Beds', 'Cessation of life', 'Competence', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging', 'Foundations', 'Inferior', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Support', 'Residencies', 'Site', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Validity of Results', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'graduate medical education', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'inter-institutional', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,503177,0.12624932234771682
"4D ventricle-valve model risk stratification for planning surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation Project Summary/Abstract Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a disease where the normal mitral valve (MV) structure is dysfunctional due to left ventricular (LV) remodeling after a myocardial infarction (MI). IMR affects nearly 3 million Americans and the magnitude of this problem is expected to grow as the population ages. IMR has a substantial mortality rate that is associated with even mild MR severity. Mitral valve repair with undersized ring annuloplasty has been the preferred treatment strategy for IMR; however, the recurrence of moderate or severe IMR within 12 months of surgery is common. Recent high profile results from the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) mul- ticenter randomized trials on IMR have confirmed a high incidence of early recurrent IMR. More importantly, these studies highlighted the adverse impact of recurrent IMR on LV remodeling and clinical outcomes. The CTSN trials demonstrated no significant difference in LV volume reduction or survival at 12 and 24 months between repair and replacement groups; however, subgroup analysis demonstrated that repair patients that developed recurrent IMR had no reduction in LV volume while repair patients without recurrence experienced LV volume reduction that was superior to patients having valve replacement. The results of the CTSN IMR trials indicate an unmet need for a pre-operative risk stratification tool that reliably predicts MV repair failure. Such a tool would significantly reduce the problem of recurrent IMR by performing valve repair only in patients likely to experience a durable result and performing valve replacement in patients with high risk of recurrence. The long term goal is to improve quality of surgical therapy in IMR by improving risk-stratification pre-operatively using image analysis tools. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve the prediction IMR recurrence by ex- panding this model to include the left ventricle (LV). The rationale is that while IMR manifests as MV malcoapta- tion, the root cause of the disease is LV remodeling. The central hypothesis is that features extracted from the integrated left ventricular and mitral valve (LVMV) model will predict recurrence more accurately than the current MV-only model. To fulfill this objective and test the central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Develop the 4D integrated LVMV model and compare the accuracy of fitting this model to intraoperative 3DTE images to that of the existing MV-only model. 2) Assess the ability of biomarkers derived from the integrated LVMV model to predict IMR recurrence, and compare to the predictive value of the MV-only model. The project is significant because, if successful, the integrated LVMV model will be incorporated into the Gorman lab ongoing effort translating this technology to the operating room, thus improving survival rates, reducing the impending clinical burden and the number of repeated procedures. Project Narrative The proposed project tackles the high impact problem of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) recurrence after surgical repair by developing a reliable real-time pre-operative risk stratification tool using image analysis of 3D transesophageal echocardiography. This will enable surgeons to optimize mitral surgical treatment in IMR on a case-by-case basis. If successful, the proposed research has the potential to virtually eliminate the problem of IMR recurrence, maximize long-term outcomes for millions of IMR patients and significantly decrease the im- pending clinical burden expected with an aging population.",4D ventricle-valve model risk stratification for planning surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation,9541444,F30HL142138,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Label', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Mitral Valve', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Transesophageal Echocardiography', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'aging population', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinically translatable', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'morphometry', 'mortality', 'muscular structure', 'papillary muscle', 'randomized trial', 'repaired', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'valve replacement', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2018,49524,0.05827719316653833
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Insightful Surgical Vision Technology (ISVision) for intelligent real-time display of anatomic, physiologic, and pathologic information in surgery Abstract Intelligent intraoperative display of anatomic and physiologic information coupled to real time situational awareness to critical tissues will benefit all surgery. The current surgical vision is limited to naked human eyes in open surgery or more recently using laparoscopic digital imaging for minimally invasive surgery and robot assisted surgery. In laparoscopic vision, although the visualization of surface anatomy and tissue physiology in the surgical field-of-view has been enhanced by recent advances in optical imaging technology, the imaging paradigm still remains passive and still poses a significant challenge due to the inherent narrow peripheral vision and limited depth perception. We propose the next generation laparoscopic vision system that provides intelligent display of unrecognized tissue structures to human eyes. Our proposed use of a new paradigm and surgical vision technology (called ISVisionTM), equipped with modular plenoptic 3-D Color/HD camera and snapshot NIR hyperspectral imager, will permit a clear visualization of the critical target tissue-of-interest, surrounding anatomy into the operative field, and situational awareness for both the tool and tissue to the surgeon.

"Insightful Surgical Vision Technology (ISVision) for intelligent real-time display of anatomic, physiologic, and pathologic information in surgery Abstract Intelligent intraoperative display of anatomic and physiologic information coupled to real time situational awareness to critical tissues will benefit all surgery. The current surgical vision is limited to naked human eyes in open surgery or more recently using laparoscopic digital imaging for minimally invasive surgery and robot assisted surgery. In laparoscopic vision, although the visualization of surface anatomy and tissue physiology in the surgical field-of-view has been enhanced by recent advances in optical imaging technology, the imaging paradigm still remains passive and still poses a significant challenge due to the inherent narrow peripheral vision and limited depth perception. We propose the next generation laparoscopic vision system that provides intelligent display of unrecognized tissue structures to human eyes. Our proposed use of a new paradigm and surgical vision technology (called ISVisionTM), equipped with modular plenoptic 3-D Color/HD camera and snapshot NIR hyperspectral imager, will permit a clear visualization of the critical target tissue-of-interest, surrounding anatomy into the operative field, and situational awareness for both the tool and tissue to the surgeon.

"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale. Different from previously proposed metrics, our approach evaluates the entire shape as a whole. With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients. Additionally, surgeons will be able to better communicate with each other and study the effects of surgical intervention on their patients which will improve patient care in the long run.",Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis,9669833,R21EB026061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye Abnormalities', 'Forehead', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Headache', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Socialization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereophotogrammetries', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Trauma patient', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'operation', 'patient stratification', 'power analysis', 'premature', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'self esteem', 'shape analysis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'web-based tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2018,317513,0.047391113445695424
"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant.

More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life.

"Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data Project Summary/Abstract Surgical operations can put patients at high risk of infections and other complications. However, studies have shown that half or more of surgical infections are discovered after hospital discharge. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) began in 2005 with the goal of assisting hospitals with identifying and preventing surgical complications. Each participating ACS NSQIP hospital assigns a surgical clinical nurse reviewer to collect preoperative through 30-day postoperative data on a sample of surgical patients in order to risk adjust postoperative complications so that they can be compared across participating hospitals. Although at large volume hospitals these samples might represent only 10-15% of all surgical cases, these data are considered to be the current gold standard for accurate identification and comparison of postoperative complications. Unfortunately, chart review is time-consuming and costly and, as a result, cannot be scaled up easily to cover all surgical patients. The goal of this project is to learn from the ACS NSQIP data in order to develop electronic algorithms for identifying postoperative infections that can be scaled up easily and inexpensively. Development of such algorithms will also permit evaluation of interventions that intend to impact large populations of patients at risk of postoperative infections. Considering the large number of available binary classification algorithms for data mining that are easy to implement, it is paramount to consider new methods for identifying surgical infections electronically. Furthermore, postoperative infections are rare, and occur in about 7% of operated patients; therefore, it is difficult to identify models that classify infections well. Sampling techniques are commonly used in conjunction with classification models in order to improve sensitivity and positive predictive value. We believe that modern statistical techniques for classification combined with strategic sampling, and the use of ICD9 and ICD10 codes and pharmacy data, will improve upon existing methods for electronically identifying postoperative infections. The aims of this proposal are (1a) to develop algorithms for identifying surgical infections using machine learning techniques, (1b) to develop models for specific types of postoperative infections collected in the ACS NSQIP data separately, which include SSI, urinary tract infection, pneumonia and sepsis and (2) to validate these models in prospective ACS NSQIP data. Project Narrative In this application, we propose to use outcomes data from the University of Colorado American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program combined with electronic health record and administrative claims data in order to develop models for identifying postoperative infections electronically. These infections are currently identified through manual chart review, and it is our hope that successful development of these models could replace costly, time-consuming manual chart review. We will use machine learning and sampling techniques to achieve better performance than models previously reported in the literature.",Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data,9505567,R03HS026019,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2018,48771,0.11267695488719649
"Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning Abstract: Our main clinical objective for this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities by significantly improving the surgical planning method. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffer from CMF deformities. The basic principles of CMF surgery involve the restoration of deformed CMF structures back to normal anatomy and functions with osteotomy, autologous, bone grafts, or vascularized free flaps. The success of CMF surgery depends on not only the technical aspects of the operation, but also, to a large extent, the precise formulation of a surgical plan. However, CMF surgical planning is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of CMF anatomy and deformity. During a routine CMF surgical planning, a surgeon first acquires a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull. He then performs 3D cephalometric analysis to quantify the deformity. Finally, the surgery is simulated by virtually cutting the 3D model into multiple bony segments. The surgeon then tries his best to move and rotate each segment individually to a desired position within the normal range of cephalometric values (the current standard of care). This is problematic as “normal” cephalometric values are the averageness of normal population, in which each value has a mean and a standard deviation. Due to the variation within the normal values, the surgeon must often guess what the exact value the patient's cephalometric measurement should be corrected to. In addition, cephalometry is a group of only linear and angular measurements, which certainly cannot represent the complex nature of human CMF structures. Therefore, surgical outcomes are often subjective and heavily dependent on the surgeons' experience and artistic talent. Because each human face is different, the average “normal values” cannot represent the complex morphology of each individual face. To this end, we hypothesize that if a surgeon can foresee what the normal CMF shape of the patient should be, the surgical plan will be objective and personalized. Therefore, in this project, we propose developing and validating a new surgical planning method of using patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models. The feasibility of our approach has already been proven by our preliminary studies. The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively. The results will be especially beneficial to patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic craniofacial deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer. In the future, our approach can also be used to design and print 3D patient-specific resorbable bone implants with tissue engineering capability for bone regeneration. Project Narrative:  The current standard of care of making treatment plan for patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF)  deformities is cephalometric analysis, including a group of linear and angular measurements, which  cannot represent the complex morphology of human CMF facial structures.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative shape-based surgical planning method of using  patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models, for replacing the current subjective  cephalometric method.  The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing  personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively, which is especially beneficial  to the patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer.",Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning,9518812,R01DE027251,"['3D Print', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Autologous', 'Back', 'Bilateral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Head', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'operation', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'psychologic', 'restoration', 'simulation', 'skull base', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,574725,0.15108716131717215
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9382352,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,479151,0.035333455835604155
"Enabling Technology for Safe Robot-assisted Surgical Micromanipulation Project Summary  The goal of this grant is to develop enabling technology and systems that address fundamental limitations in microsurgery with a specific focus on vitreoretinal surgery. Due to the inherent micro-scale and the fragility of the neurosensory retina, vitreoretinal surgeons can be challenged by physiological hand tremor where the tremor amplitude is larger than retinal structures, delicate movements that are below tactile sensation, and multiple cognitive decisions that are required when executing high-risk movements, such as during retinal vein cannulation (RVC). Nevertheless currently vitreoretinal surgery is at the limits of human physiological performance and lacks the adequate technology that could further improve the technical performance. This situation is less than optimal and can significantly benefit from the recent advances in medical robotics, sensor feedback and human machine interface design. Robotic assistance may be ideally suited to address common problems encountered in the performance of the demanding micromanipulations in retinal microsurgery.  We propose a robotic system with enhanced real-time multisensory feedback that assesses multiple points of instrument contact located both inside and outside of the eye. Our comprehensive system will enable the surgeon to manipulate tools based on quantitative feedback that will prevent mechanical injury by implementing safeguards against the application of excessive and previously unmeasurable forces at the eyewall and the tool tip. Our aims are: (1) Develop and demonstrate in vivo position/force hybrid control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy for safe robot-assisted vitreoretinal microsurgery: real-time sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy will be uniquely used to control the robot through a machine learning method that adaptively learns a nonlinear mapping from user behavior to sclera-force/position and predicts unsafe motions; (2) Develop and demonstrate in vivo force-input control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the tool-tip for safe robot-assisted vein cannulation: real-time tool- tip-to-tissue interaction force sensing and non-linear robot control algorithms based on observing the user behavior will be used to control the tool-tip position and force and to prevent entry into subretinal areas during RVC; (3) Demonstrate safe robot-assisted RVC in rabbit model in vivo: real-time, position/force hybrid control algorithms based on dual-point (tool-shaft and tip) information fusion will provide sensorimotor guidance of surgical maneuvers during RVC. Statistically significant results in vivo, in clinically realistic conditions will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.  This highly innovative system will enable surgeons to perform maneuvers in a tremor free environment with a higher level of precision than previously possible and with the ability to sense forces on a scale that have been previously imperceptible. We envision this development as a logical next step in the integration of man, machine and computer for the performance of unprecedented microsurgical maneuvers. Project Narrative  This R01 grant addresses fundamental limitations in current microsurgical practice, focusing on vitreoretinal surgery (VRS), which is the most technically demanding ophthalmologic surgery. Our goal is to develop a cooperatively controlled robotic system with enhanced sensorimotor capabilities that in conjunction with multifunction force-sensing microsurgical instruments could enable safe robot-assisted retinal surgery. Although focused on VRS, our results will be applicable to a broader range of microsurgical training and practice.",Enabling Technology for Safe Robot-assisted Surgical Micromanipulation,9291018,R01EB023943,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Cannulations', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Micromanipulation', 'Microsurgery', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Retinal Perforations', 'Retinal Vein Occlusion', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sclera', 'Site', 'Sterilization', 'Structure', 'Structure of central vein of the retina', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Veins', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'design', 'dexterity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'medical specialties', 'multisensory', 'neurosensory', 'neurosurgery', 'operation', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'trend', 'virtual']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,305007,0.06717216757099478
"Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects more than 479,000 children; 30% of those are not controlled with medication and may require surgery. We developed a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that can be integrated into neurology practice to detect patients who may be eligible for epilepsy surgical consults. Once implemented, this research can help to drive successful implementations of NLP and identify and use ideal alerting mechanisms in neurological care.",Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients,9355161,R21HS024977,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2017,159334,0.02721662258440417
"Objective assessment of surgical competence in a septoplasty model ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To ensure patient safety, educators must train surgeons to set standards of competency, public health officials should put in place policies to ensure surgeons remain competent and surgeons should only perform surgeries that they are competent to perform. Measuring surgeon's technical skill is crucial part of determining if they are competent. Traditionally surgical skill is assessed most commonly during training using subjective non-validated metrics. This leads to variation in the definition of competency. Recent policies set forth by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education- the governing body for graduate medical education, mandate that technical skill be measured objectively. Currently, there are few valid objective measures available to measure technical competence. Our research will yield a set of tools and methodologies that can be deployed to across medical training programs to objectively measure surgical skill and competence. This platform is also capable of developing new objective measure of skill and competence. Specifically, first, we will develop an objective skills assessment platform, and establish standard data collection and quality assurance protocols for systematic deployment of our platform across multiple institutions. Second, our work will result in automated algorithms and analytic tools to objectivel measure skill using data captured with our platform. Third, we will establish objective methods to determine whether a surgeon is competent to perform surgery. Fourth, we will test the reliability and validity of our assessment tools. We will conduct our study using septoplasty as the prototype test-bed procedure. Septoplasty is a commonly performed procedure (more than 260,000 cases per year) and is a key index surgery by which residents in otolaryngology are evaluated. Our project lays the groundwork for subsequent research to establish national standards for objective skill and competency using data aggregated from numerous training programs in the country. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Policies for graduate medical education require that surgical competency be objectively determined, but currently available technology and methods do not yield objective assessments for surgical skill. Our project aims to provide educators with an integrated objective skills assessment platform and tools for objective determination of competency, which can be readily deployed across graduate surgical training programs in the country.",Objective assessment of surgical competence in a septoplasty model,9307777,R01DE025265,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Beds', 'Cessation of life', 'Competence', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging', 'Foundations', 'Inferior', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Support', 'Residencies', 'Site', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Validity of Results', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'graduate medical education', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'inter-institutional', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,501850,0.12624932234771682
"MOLECULAR GUIDED SURGERY FOR IMPROVED RESECTION OF GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to facilitate the candidate's transition to a role as a leading academic researcher and multidisciplinary team member developing optical fluorescence-based technology, with the goal of improving extent of tumor resection (EOTR) in brain cancer. In particular, a focus of this proposal is on advancing fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) within the context of neurosurgical oncology. To this end, the proposal outlines a mentored-training program with a strong clinical emphasis to compliment the candidate's proficiency in medical and optical imaging, placing the candidate within a critical mass of NIH-funded researchers at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). The plan will focus on four complimentary areas: 1) providing a solid understanding of neurosurgical oncology, 2) developing an expertise in cancer molecular biology, 3) leading a pre-clinical investigation of molecular-guided cancer surgery, 4) expanding skills in optical engineering and machine learning, all of which will emphasize the synergy between understanding the clinical problems in neuro-oncology and advancing technology to address these problems. These goals are strongly supported by an experienced mentor team, led by neurosurgery section-chief Dr. Roberts, alongside NIH-funded researchers Profs. Paulsen, Pogue, and Hoopes.

"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Using the electronic health record to identify children likely to suffer last-minute surgery cancellation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Last-minute cancellation of surgery frequently leads to psychological stress and financial hardships that disproportionately affect individuals of low socioeconomic status. Moreover, cancellation leaves unutilized healthcare resources valued as high as $1 per second. Machine learning can uncover patterns in historical data to identify predictors, and captures relationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk associated with a particular set of conditions. There is a critical need to develop a model system through machine learning both to understand and to predict cancellation. The long-term goal is to develop evidence- based strategies for improved perioperative resource utilization and efficiency. The overall objective in this application is to develop and deploy an analytical model for predicting last-minute surgical cancellations. The central hypothesis is that a predictive model based on patient-specific and contextual factors will accurately determine the probability of cancellation. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data showing that risk of cancellation varies substantially with respect to data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). The rationale for the proposed research is that development of a model that can accurately predict the probability of last-minute cancellation of surgical procedures is likely to provide new opportunities for improving healthcare costs and efficiency. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Develop computerized models for predicting surgery cancellation; 2) Identify key predictors of last-minute cancelation of surgery from the EHR and online data resources; and 3) Establish a scalable last-minute surgery cancellation prediction system. Under the first aim, using a pre-existing database and machine- learning techniques already established as feasible in the applicants' hands, patient-specific and contextual data from two pediatric surgical sites in a large Midwest conurbation will be mined. Under the second aim, these predictive models will be interrogated to generate actionable advice. Under the third aim, the optimal model will be identified and integrated into the clinical workflow to direct cancellation prevention and mitigation strategies. The approach is innovative, in the applicants' opinion, because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by employing machine-learning techniques on large and detailed datasets drawing from the modern EHR and publicly available contextual data. The proposed research is significant because it will both have broad translational importance in perioperative management and also elucidate the etiology of cancellation. The positive impact is expected to be in facilitating quality improvement projects and operating room management strategies to increase utilization of expensive perioperative resources. Successful completion of the proposed research is also expected to lead to more timely surgeries at lower cost for hundreds of thousands of patients, which is of vital importance at a time when the cost of healthcare is ever increasing. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because a clinically useful approach to decreasing last- minute cancellations of surgery will provide new opportunities to reduce healthcare expenditures and improve overall efficiency.

"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. The above translates to an estimated 23,170 new cases diagnosed this year with approximately 14,080 deaths. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function.

"Impact of Crouch Gait and Surgical Treatment on Knee Mechanics and Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) often exhibit crouch gait, which is characterized by excessive knee flexion during stance. This form of walking is extremely fatiguing and tends to progress until eventually walking ability ceases. A newly revived surgical procedure, distal femoral extension osteotomy (DFEO) and patellar tendon advancement (PTA), simultaneously addresses both knee flexion contractures and patella alta (superiorly displaced patella) that often co-exist in those with crouch. Initial outcoe studies demonstrate greater improvements in gait than conventional surgical treatments. However, complication rates remain high and some patients exhibit little to no improvement in gait after surgery. The first aim of this study is to investigate the effects of patella position, crouch and surgical parameters on functional knee mechanics. Computational knee models will be created that include detailed representations of ligament and articular cartilage geometry within the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints. Patella alta and knee flexion contractures will be introduced, and surgical simulations will be performed virtually. The computational models will then be used to simulate knee mechanics when walking in normal, and mild, moderate, and severe crouch gait postures. Probabilistic simulations will then be used to investigate how variability in physical characteristics and surgical factors can contribute to variable outcomes. The effects of surgery and crouch gait on cartilage pressure patterns will also be determined, which is relevant for understanding subsequent skeletal growth and long-term cartilage health. The second aim investigates whether a combination of quantitative measures of physical characteristics and surgical parameters can retrospectively classify post-surgical gait performance. Pre- and post-surgical x- rays will be used to quantitatively measure the Koshino index (metric of patella alta/baja), the magnitude and location of the DFEO, and the PTA advancement distance in patients who previously underwent DFEO+PTA. Pre-surgical measures of knee flexion contracture and spasticity will also be obtained. Pre- and post-operative gait analysis data will be used to assess changes in gait mechanics, while functional surveys will assess changes in performance on activities of daily living. The random forest algorithm will then be used to identify decision trees and associate predictor variables that can classify those patients whose gait and overall function improved after surgery. These results will be interpreted in the context of modeling results from Aim 1, thereby providing a potential mechanistic explanation for clinical observations. The research will impact innumerable CP patients as the DFEO+PTA surgical procedures are adopted around the world, and will also set the groundwork for more rigorous scientific study of other procedures used to treat gait disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) often exhibit a crouch walking posture, which can be extremely fatiguing, painful and disabling as a child grows. Orthopedic surgical procedures are used to correct the physical abnormalities that contribute to crouch, but clinical outcomes remain variable and difficult to predict. This study uses a combination of computational models and retrospective analyses of clinical data to identify the physical and surgical treatment factors that can best restore more normal walking function in CP patients.",Impact of Crouch Gait and Surgical Treatment on Knee Mechanics and Function,8975231,R21HD084213,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Growth', 'Cartilage', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contracture', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Distal', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Geometry', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Height', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee bone', 'Ligaments', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgical Procedures', 'Osteotomy', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pain', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Factor', 'Walking', 'Work', 'articular cartilage', 'crouch gait', 'forest', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'human subject', 'improved functioning', 'indexing', 'knee mechanics', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'quadriceps muscle', 'restoration', 'simulation', 'skeletal', 'spasticity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2016,168604,0.16705439077394246
"Objective assessment of surgical competence in a septoplasty model ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To ensure patient safety, educators must train surgeons to set standards of competency, public health officials should put in place policies to ensure surgeons remain competent and surgeons should only perform surgeries that they are competent to perform. Measuring surgeon's technical skill is crucial part of determining if they are competent. Traditionally surgical skill is assessed most commonly during training using subjective non-validated metrics. This leads to variation in the definition of competency. Recent policies set forth by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education- the governing body for graduate medical education, mandate that technical skill be measured objectively. Currently, there are few valid objective measures available to measure technical competence. Our research will yield a set of tools and methodologies that can be deployed to across medical training programs to objectively measure surgical skill and competence. This platform is also capable of developing new objective measure of skill and competence. Specifically, first, we will develop an objective skills assessment platform, and establish standard data collection and quality assurance protocols for systematic deployment of our platform across multiple institutions. Second, our work will result in automated algorithms and analytic tools to objectivel measure skill using data captured with our platform. Third, we will establish objective methods to determine whether a surgeon is competent to perform surgery. Fourth, we will test the reliability and validity of our assessment tools. We will conduct our study using septoplasty as the prototype test-bed procedure. Septoplasty is a commonly performed procedure (more than 260,000 cases per year) and is a key index surgery by which residents in otolaryngology are evaluated. Our project lays the groundwork for subsequent research to establish national standards for objective skill and competency using data aggregated from numerous training programs in the country. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Policies for graduate medical education require that surgical competency be objectively determined, but currently available technology and methods do not yield objective assessments for surgical skill. Our project aims to provide educators with an integrated objective skills assessment platform and tools for objective determination of competency, which can be readily deployed across graduate surgical training programs in the country.",Objective assessment of surgical competence in a septoplasty model,9112985,R01DE025265,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Beds', 'Cessation of life', 'Competence', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Inferior', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Support', 'Residencies', 'Site', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'graduate medical education', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'inter-institutional', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,505672,0.12624932234771682
"Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects more than 479,000 children; 30% of those are not controlled with medication and may require surgery. We developed a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that can be integrated into neurology practice to detect patients who may be eligible for epilepsy surgical consults. Once implemented, this research can help to drive successful implementations of NLP and identify and use ideal alerting mechanisms in neurological care.",Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients,9222109,R21HS024977,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2016,137233,0.02721662258440417
"MOLECULAR GUIDED SURGERY FOR IMPROVED RESECTION OF GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to facilitate the candidate's transition to a role as a leading academic researcher and multidisciplinary team member developing optical fluorescence-based technology, with the goal of improving extent of tumor resection (EOTR) in brain cancer. In particular, a focus of this proposal is on advancing fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) within the context of neurosurgical oncology. To this end, the proposal outlines a mentored-training program with a strong clinical emphasis to compliment the candidate's proficiency in medical and optical imaging, placing the candidate within a critical mass of NIH-funded researchers at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). The plan will focus on four complimentary areas: 1) providing a solid understanding of neurosurgical oncology, 2) developing an expertise in cancer molecular biology, 3) leading a pre-clinical investigation of molecular-guided cancer surgery, 4) expanding skills in optical engineering and machine learning, all of which will emphasize the synergy between understanding the clinical problems in neuro-oncology and advancing technology to address these problems. These goals are strongly supported by an experienced mentor team, led by neurosurgery section-chief Dr. Roberts, alongside NIH-funded researchers Profs. Paulsen, Pogue, and Hoopes. Leveraging the extensive opportunities at Dartmouth, the candidate will use K99 funding to devote time to graduate courses in cancer biology, medical imaging, and translational medicine, and to attend cancer workshops, training seminars, and CME-accredited Grand Rounds at the NCI Norris Cotton Cancer Center. The candidate will also attend AACR workshops to further strengthen clinical understanding of neuro-oncology, and provide a venue for presentation and feedback on the research work. The firm knowledge base gained by this training plan will be applied within the context of a pre-clinical research project to develop and evaluate a novel method of FGS- molecular-guided surgery (MGS) by means of intraoperative receptor concentration imaging (iRCI). The project will extend the rapidly growing field of FGS, applying a novel kinetic imaging approach to allow intraoperative evaluation of tumor-associated receptor expression, and to use this to guide surgical resection. Aim (1) will be to develop and test iRCI in a rat model of GBM, evaluating the accuracy of MGS to identify positive tissue and to improve EOTR compared with current FGS methods. Aim (2) will be to advance the current FGS camera systems, incorporating arterial input function measurement, and reducing absorption and scatter-based artifacts due to surface blood at the surgical site. Aim (3) will be to facilitate iRCI integrationinto the surgical workflow through strategic improvements in dye administration and AIF characterization. This proposal will expand the candidate's knowledge-base in cancer biology and surgical oncology, through extensive training opportunities and interactions with a strong multi-disciplinary team of mentors, equipping the candidate with all the necessary skills to accelerate the trajectory of his promising research career.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will provide the candidate an opportunity to broaden cancer biology and neurosurgical oncology skills through a comprehensive training program, to supplement already advanced skills in neuroimaging.

"Using the electronic health record to identify children likely to suffer last-minute surgery cancellation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Last-minute cancellation of surgery frequently leads to psychological stress and financial hardships that disproportionately affect individuals of low socioeconomic status. Moreover, cancellation leaves unutilized healthcare resources valued as high as $1 per second. Machine learning can uncover patterns in historical data to identify predictors, and captures relationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk associated with a particular set of conditions. There is a critical need to develop a model system through machine learning both to understand and to predict cancellation. The long-term goal is to develop evidence- based strategies for improved perioperative resource utilization and efficiency. The overall objective in this application is to develop and deploy an analytical model for predicting last-minute surgical cancellations. The central hypothesis is that a predictive model based on patient-specific and contextual factors will accurately determine the probability of cancellation. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data showing that risk of cancellation varies substantially with respect to data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). The rationale for the proposed research is that development of a model that can accurately predict the probability of last-minute cancellation of surgical procedures is likely to provide new opportunities for improving healthcare costs and efficiency. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Develop computerized models for predicting surgery cancellation; 2) Identify key predictors of last-minute cancelation of surgery from the EHR and online data resources; and 3) Establish a scalable last-minute surgery cancellation prediction system. Under the first aim, using a pre-existing database and machine- learning techniques already established as feasible in the applicants' hands, patient-specific and contextual data from two pediatric surgical sites in a large Midwest conurbation will be mined. Under the second aim, these predictive models will be interrogated to generate actionable advice. Under the third aim, the optimal model will be identified and integrated into the clinical workflow to direct cancellation prevention and mitigation strategies. The approach is innovative, in the applicants' opinion, because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by employing machine-learning techniques on large and detailed datasets drawing from the modern EHR and publicly available contextual data. The proposed research is significant because it will both have broad translational importance in perioperative management and also elucidate the etiology of cancellation. The positive impact is expected to be in facilitating quality improvement projects and operating room management strategies to increase utilization of expensive perioperative resources. Successful completion of the proposed research is also expected to lead to more timely surgeries at lower cost for hundreds of thousands of patients, which is of vital importance at a time when the cost of healthcare is ever increasing. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because a clinically useful approach to decreasing last- minute cancellations of surgery will provide new opportunities to reduce healthcare expenditures and improve overall efficiency. The project is relevant to AHRQ's mission by making surgical care more accessible, equitable, and affordable.",Using the electronic health record to identify children likely to suffer last-minute surgery cancellation,9223041,R21HS024983,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2016,119761,0.05706342453130157
"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30.

"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training.

"Impact of Crouch Gait and Surgical Treatment on Knee Mechanics and Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) often exhibit crouch gait, which is characterized by excessive knee flexion during stance. This form of walking is extremely fatiguing and tends to progress until eventually walking ability ceases. A newly revived surgical procedure, distal femoral extension osteotomy (DFEO) and patellar tendon advancement (PTA), simultaneously addresses both knee flexion contractures and patella alta (superiorly displaced patella) that often co-exist in those with crouch. Initial outcoe studies demonstrate greater improvements in gait than conventional surgical treatments. However, complication rates remain high and some patients exhibit little to no improvement in gait after surgery. The first aim of this study is to investigate the effects of patella position, crouch and surgical parameters on functional knee mechanics. Computational knee models will be created that include detailed representations of ligament and articular cartilage geometry within the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints. Patella alta and knee flexion contractures will be introduced, and surgical simulations will be performed virtually. The computational models will then be used to simulate knee mechanics when walking in normal, and mild, moderate, and severe crouch gait postures. Probabilistic simulations will then be used to investigate how variability in physical characteristics and surgical factors can contribute to variable outcomes. The effects of surgery and crouch gait on cartilage pressure patterns will also be determined, which is relevant for understanding subsequent skeletal growth and long-term cartilage health. The second aim investigates whether a combination of quantitative measures of physical characteristics and surgical parameters can retrospectively classify post-surgical gait performance. Pre- and post-surgical x- rays will be used to quantitatively measure the Koshino index (metric of patella alta/baja), the magnitude and location of the DFEO, and the PTA advancement distance in patients who previously underwent DFEO+PTA. Pre-surgical measures of knee flexion contracture and spasticity will also be obtained. Pre- and post-operative gait analysis data will be used to assess changes in gait mechanics, while functional surveys will assess changes in performance on activities of daily living. The random forest algorithm will then be used to identify decision trees and associate predictor variables that can classify those patients whose gait and overall function improved after surgery. These results will be interpreted in the context of modeling results from Aim 1, thereby providing a potential mechanistic explanation for clinical observations. The research will impact innumerable CP patients as the DFEO+PTA surgical procedures are adopted around the world, and will also set the groundwork for more rigorous scientific study of other procedures used to treat gait disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) often exhibit a crouch walking posture, which can be extremely fatiguing, painful and disabling as a child grows. Orthopedic surgical procedures are used to correct the physical abnormalities that contribute to crouch, but clinical outcomes remain variable and difficult to predict. This study uses a combination of computational models and retrospective analyses of clinical data to identify the physical and surgical treatment factors that can best restore more normal walking function in CP patients.                ",Impact of Crouch Gait and Surgical Treatment on Knee Mechanics and Function,8815132,R21HD084213,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Growth', 'Cartilage', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contracture', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Distal', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Geometry', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Height', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee bone', 'Ligaments', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgical Procedures', 'Osteotomy', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pain', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Factor', 'Walking', 'Work', 'articular cartilage', 'crouch gait', 'forest', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'human subject', 'improved functioning', 'indexing', 'knee mechanics', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'quadriceps muscle', 'restoration', 'simulation', 'skeletal']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2015,217599,0.16705439077394246
"Objective assessment of surgical competence in a septoplasty model ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To ensure patient safety, educators must train surgeons to set standards of competency, public health officials should put in place policies to ensure surgeons remain competent and surgeons should only perform surgeries that they are competent to perform. Measuring surgeon's technical skill is crucial part of determining if they are competent. Traditionally surgical skill is assessed most commonly during training using subjective non-validated metrics. This leads to variation in the definition of competency. Recent policies set forth by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education- the governing body for graduate medical education, mandate that technical skill be measured objectively. Currently, there are few valid objective measures available to measure technical competence. Our research will yield a set of tools and methodologies that can be deployed to across medical training programs to objectively measure surgical skill and competence. This platform is also capable of developing new objective measure of skill and competence. Specifically, first, we will develop an objective skills assessment platform, and establish standard data collection and quality assurance protocols for systematic deployment of our platform across multiple institutions. Second, our work will result in automated algorithms and analytic tools to objectivel measure skill using data captured with our platform. Third, we will establish objective methods to determine whether a surgeon is competent to perform surgery. Fourth, we will test the reliability and validity of our assessment tools. We will conduct our study using septoplasty as the prototype test-bed procedure. Septoplasty is a commonly performed procedure (more than 260,000 cases per year) and is a key index surgery by which residents in otolaryngology are evaluated. Our project lays the groundwork for subsequent research to establish national standards for objective skill and competency using data aggregated from numerous training programs in the country.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Policies for graduate medical education require that surgical competency be objectively determined, but currently available technology and methods do not yield objective assessments for surgical skill. Our project aims to provide educators with an integrated objective skills assessment platform and tools for objective determination of competency, which can be readily deployed across graduate surgical training programs in the country.            ",Objective assessment of surgical competence in a septoplasty model,8944969,R01DE025265,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Cessation of life', 'Competence', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging', 'Foundations', 'Inferior', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Support', 'Residencies', 'Site', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'graduate medical education', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,582025,0.12624932234771682
"Intraocular Robotic Interventional Surgical System for Cataract Surgery Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical outcomes have been dramatically improved in the last 2 decades through the integration of new technologies including among other innovative visualization systems and robotic assistance. We think that cataract surgery can also benefit from these advancements and we envision that cataract surgery will possibly be entirely performed in fifteen years from now by an automated robotic surgical platform. The goal of the present proposal is to develop automated capabilities of the Intraocular Robotic Interventional Surgical System (IRISS) based on its new abilities to reconstruct in real time the anatomical structures of the anterior segment of the eye. This 3D real time reconstruction of the anterior segment of the eye is made possible by the joint use of Computer Vision techniques and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) acquisition and analysis. Cataracts are the number one cause of blindness in the world and cataract surgery is the most frequently performed operation totaling 3 million operations every year in the United States. The procedure accounts for the single largest expenditure for any Part B procedure in the Medicare Program. The modern cataract surgical procedure involves several steps each with significant potential for complicated inadvertent tissue manipulation possibly resulting in intraocular trauma. Previous studies have shown that undesired tissue manipulation can be significantly decreased using robotic systems that attenuate undesirable movement, and possibly collision, of surgical tools both intraocularly and at the site of incision. Thus, we have developed IRISS, the first dual arm, intraocular robotic surgical system designed for performing intraocular surgeries with a primary focus on cataract surgery. Preliminary results have shown an optimization of vibration reduction, a controlled remote center of motion (RCM) for both robotic arms and the ability to mount multiple surgical instruments to either arm with automated surgical instrument replacement. The system has been used to perform successfully Ex Vivo cataract surgeries on pig eyes by teleoperation, completing capsulorhexis, lens aspiration, as well as maneuvers even more technically challenging than cataract removal such as vitrectomy and retinal vein cannulation To achieve automated cataract surgery, the present study will develop new vision- based object tracking system utilizing real time local gradient orientation analysis algorithms and develop an OCT guided 3D real-time reconstruction of the anterior segment of the eye to offer feedback to the robotic system. We hypothesize that an improved anatomical detection system will decrease the incidence of undesirable trauma to ocular tissues by creating restrictions on the proximity of surgical tools to ocular structures. By performing Ex Vivo testing of cataract extraction surgeries on harvested pig eyes, the efficacy and accuracy of the system will be assessed by the evaluation of the corneal endothelial cell, the iris and the capsular bag integrity and of the complete removal of the lens material. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop new capabilities of the robotic manipulated platform to perform an automated cataract extraction surgical procedure. Automated lens extraction will be achieved using real-time tracking and 3D reconstruction of the ocular structures. In automating the surgical procedure we believe that the incidence of inadvertent tissue manipulation, and the associated intraocular tissue trauma, will decline.",Intraocular Robotic Interventional Surgical System for Cataract Surgery Project,8935826,R21EY024065,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior eyeball segment structure', 'Attenuated', 'Automation', 'Blindness', 'Cannulations', 'Capsulorhexis', 'Cataract', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Endothelium', 'Detection', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Expenditure', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Iris', 'Irrigation', 'Joints', 'Lasers', 'Manuals', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of central vein of the retina', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Surgical complication', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Vitrectomy', 'arm', 'base', 'capsule', 'design', 'image guided', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lens', 'new technology', 'operation', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'robot assistance', 'tissue trauma', 'tomography', 'tool', 'vibration']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2015,369679,0.17341085785550264
"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. The above translates to an estimated 23,170 new cases diagnosed this year with approximately 14,080 deaths. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life. The goal of this project is to assist the surgeon in producing a more complete resection of brain tumors. The other important aspect is the technology we are introducing is relatively inexpensive and is amenable to widespread adoption by medical centers all across the country.",Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface,8843052,R01NS049251,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lasers', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Error', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Wit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'cost', 'functional restoration', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'intraoperative imaging', 'male', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,716624,0.059890234660570786
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training. The statistical inference techniques developed can be applicable to genetic epidemiology, health economics, and bioinformatics.",SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic*,8934115,R01EB020426,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Elastic Tissue', 'Elasticity', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life Style', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammary Ultrasonography', 'Mammography', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening for cancer', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Societies', 'Staging', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'design', 'evidence base', 'genetic epidemiology', 'health economics', 'image registration', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant stomach neoplasm', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prostate biopsy', 'prototype', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,214237,0.03035718289274728
"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis.    A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Image-guided planning system for skull correction in children with craniosynostos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial sutures and occurs in approximately one in 2000 live births. It results in cranial malformation that can lead to elevated intra-cranial pressure, brain growth impairment, and developmental deficiency. The most common treatment option for craniosynostosis is surgery. Currently, surgical treatment planning of craniosynostosis is mostly qualitative, subjective and irreproducible guided mainly by the surgeon's experience. While virtual planning has been successfully introduced in niche areas of craniofacial surgery, such as corrective jaw surgery applications, clinical tools that provide accurate and reproducible evaluation of cranial morphology to guide cranial vault remodeling do not yet exist. To cover this gap in current clinical practice, we will develop personalized preoperative planning for infants with craniosynostosis that allows for decreased operative time and blood loss, thereby reducing perioperative morbidity, but also facilitates an optimized and more durable long-term outcome.  In this Phase I STTR project, our goal is to design, develop and validate a virtual surgery system for optimal treatment planning for cranial remodeling. The plan includes creating a normative multi-atlas database to capture a wide breadth of normal variations on cranial shape and patient ages, developing image processing and statistical shape analysis algorithms to identify desirable post-operative skull shapes, and analyzing biomechanical properties of cranial bones to evaluate osteotomy plans. The surgeon will be presented with a visual and quantitative map of the patient's cranial malformations, the desired post-treatment cranial shape, and a personalized plan of how cranial shape should be altered in the least invasive fashion to most accurately approach the normal head shape. The impact of our technology is reduced perioperative morbidity and lower treatment costs. The technology will also enable the precise, quantitative comparison of measurements before and after cranial vault reconstruction to determine the efficacy and durability of specific reconstructive techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial sutures and occurs in approximately one in 2000 live births.

The system has been used to perform successfully Ex Vivo cataract surgeries on pig eyes by teleoperation, completing capsulorhexis, lens aspiration, as well as maneuvers even more technically challenging than cataract removal such as vitrectomy and retinal vein cannulation To achieve automated cataract surgery, the present study will develop new vision- based object tracking system utilizing real time local gradient orientation analysis algorithms and develop an OCT guided 3D real-time reconstruction of the anterior segment of the eye to offer feedback to the robotic system. We hypothesize that an improved anatomical detection system will decrease the incidence of undesirable trauma to ocular tissues by creating restrictions on the proximity of surgical tools to ocular structures. By performing Ex Vivo testing of cataract extraction surgeries on harvested pig eyes, the efficacy and accuracy of the system will be assessed by the evaluation of the corneal endothelial cell, the iris and the capsular bag integrity and of the complete removal of the lens material.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop new capabilities of the robotic manipulated platform to perform an automated cataract extraction surgical procedure. Automated lens extraction will be achieved using real-time tracking and 3D reconstruction of the ocular structures. In automating the surgical procedure we believe that the incidence of inadvertent tissue manipulation, and the associated intraocular tissue trauma, will decline.            ",Intraocular Robotic Interventional Surgical System for Cataract Surgery Project,8773508,R21EY024065,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior eyeball segment structure', 'Attenuated', 'Automation', 'Blindness', 'Cannulations', 'Capsulorhexis', 'Cataract', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Endothelium', 'Detection', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Expenditure', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Iris', 'Irrigation', 'Joints', 'Lasers', 'Manuals', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of central vein of the retina', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Surgical complication', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Vitrectomy', 'arm', 'base', 'capsule', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lens', 'new technology', 'operation', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'robot assistance', 'tissue trauma', 'tomography', 'tool', 'vibration']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2014,46275,0.17341085785550264
"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. The above translates to an estimated 23,170 new cases diagnosed this year with approximately 14,080 deaths. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life. The goal of this project is to assist the surgeon in producing a more complete resection of brain tumors. The other important aspect is the technology we are introducing is relatively inexpensive and is amenable to widespread adoption by medical centers all across the country.            ",Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface,8720479,R01NS049251,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lasers', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Error', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Wit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'cost', 'functional restoration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'intraoperative imaging', 'male', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,566111,0.059890234660570786
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training. The statistical inference techniques developed can be applicable to genetic epidemiology, health economics, and bioinformatics.",SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic*,8788148,R01EB020426,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Elastic Tissue', 'Elasticity', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammary Ultrasonography', 'Mammography', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening for cancer', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Societies', 'Staging', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aging population', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'design', 'evidence base', 'genetic epidemiology', 'health economics', 'image registration', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant stomach neoplasm', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2014,223808,0.03035718289274728
"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis.    A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Developing a Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development and Validation of a Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST) For the first time in the history of surgical education, a comprehensive program to teach and evaluate the cognitive and psychomotor aspects unique to laparoscopic surgery - the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) developed originally by the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgery (SAGES) and subsequently by a joint committee which includes the American College of Surgeons (ACS) - is being embraced nationally for training and credentialing laparoscopic surgeons. As an example of its growing acceptance by the medical community, starting in 2009, the American Board of Surgeons has mandated that passing the FLS certifying examination will be required for taking the board examination in surgery. While the cognitive assessment in FLS is based on 75 multiple-choice questions, a proctored examination is used for the manual skills assessment which includes five tasks to be performed in a portable pelvic trainer box with built-in video camera: bimanual peg transfer, precise pattern cutting, use of ligating loops and suturing with intracorporeal and extracorporeal knot tying. In spite of the growing popularity of the FLS, there are several major problems with this box trainer paradigm: (1) the assessment is subjective, (2) there is no feedback during learning except when an experienced trainer is present, (3) a large number of qualified proctors must be engaged during test taking, (4) the training material must be constantly replaced, and (5) the test-takers must travel to one of the 27 Regional Test Centers or the Annual SAGES meeting or the ACS Clinical Congress. To overcome these problems and to enable greater dissemination, we propose to develop and validate a Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST) whereby tasks available in the FLS may be performed on PCs and laptops with inexpensive haptic (touch) interface devices, such as the Phantom(R) OmniTM. To develop the VBLaST a novel set of technologies must be developed including rapid, but highly realistic physics-based virtual interaction paradigms and statistical machine learning techniques to develop a ""virtual mentor"" which will provide real time automated feedback to the trainees. A comprehensive set of studies involving students, residents, fellows and practicing surgeons at Boston area hospitals (e.g., BIDMC, Tufts Medical Center, Cambridge Health Alliance, Harvard, MGH, Brigham & Women's, Lahey Clinic) will be undertaken to test the validity of the VBLaST as a training tool and establish its usefulness in transferring the acquired skills to the operating room. Once validated, the VBLaST will have exponential impact in reducing training costs and training time while improving patient safety and outcomes, A multidisciplinary team with collective expertise in physics-based interactive medical simulation, laparoscopic surgery and surgical education, and human factors engineering has been assembled to achieve the following Specific Aims: SA1) To develop a realistic virtual basic laparoscopic skill trainer (VBLaST) platform to perform all the tasks available in the FLS training tool box. SA2) To establish the validity of the VBLaST as a training tool. SA3) To evaluate the usefulness of the VBLaST as a training tool. SA4) To develop a web-based interface for the VBLaST.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to develop a comprehensive computer-based technology that will allow surgical trainees to practice their surgical skills and to take standardized tests on computer-based models. Surgical procedures and techniques, learnt and perfected in this risk-free manner before application to patients, will translate to fewer operating room errors, reduced patient morbidity and improved patient outcomes resulting in faster healing, shorter hospital stay and reduced post surgical complications and treatment costs.

"Neurointensive Care and Assessment Facility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this G20 proposal is to create a shared Neurointensive Care and Assessment Facility (NCAF) to study acute and long-term responses in large animal models of disease and injury to enable the development and translation of new treatments and technologies that promote and preserve neurological function. This revised proposal responds specifically and substantively to each comment raised in the initial review. The NCAF will be a one-of-a-kind shared porcine facility for the study of neurological injury and recovery after stroke, cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary bypass, and traumatic brain injury in pigs/piglets d 25kg. The facility will consist of 5 components: (1) a non-sterile procedure room for closed head injuries and terminal procedures, (2) an intensive care housing room, (3) a cognitive and behavioral assessment laboratory, (4) a survival surgical room, and (5) animal prep area. Facilities will be upgraded to allow survival surgery on USDA-regulated species and meet requirements of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (ILAR, 1996; pre-publication, 2010), and provide a state-of-the art intensive care unit for monitoring and housing animals. Additional space will be renovated to serve as procedural space for cognitive and behavioral assessment using a battery of porcine-specific tests developed by the Facility Director. Finally, the NCAF facility will be upgraded to meet federal and other regulatory requirements that ensure safety, sanitization, security, vermin control and environmental control for surgery, experimental procedure, intensive care housing and behavioral study areas. The NCAF will be used for the study of more than 800 piglets/pigs per year, and will be shared by 25 investigators spanning the School of Medicine (SOM) and School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) with over $42, million in current and pending funding. Moreover, this new facility will be a unique opportunity to create synergy between SOM faculty investigating cell and molecular approaches to therapeutic interventions that preserve neurofunction, with SEAS faculty who are innovators in device development, data integration, data processing, machine learning, biosensors and minimally invasive surgical technology. Thus, these renovations will enhance PHS-funded research, will advance the conduct of animal welfare in experimental research, and will positively impact the scope and pace of the preclinical research at Penn.          n/a",Neurointensive Care and Assessment Facility,8188836,G20RR029785,"['Acute', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Housing', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Closed head injuries', 'Cognitive', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'Housing', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'Security', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'guide for the care and use of laboratory animals', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'neurological recovery', 'pre-clinical research', 'research study', 'response']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,G20,2011,500000,0.025104559628022723
"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Developing a Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development and Validation of a Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST) For the first time in the history of surgical education, a comprehensive program to teach and evaluate the cognitive and psychomotor aspects unique to laparoscopic surgery - the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) developed originally by the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgery (SAGES) and subsequently by a joint committee which includes the American College of Surgeons (ACS) - is being embraced nationally for training and credentialing laparoscopic surgeons. As an example of its growing acceptance by the medical community, starting in 2009, the American Board of Surgeons has mandated that passing the FLS certifying examination will be required for taking the board examination in surgery. While the cognitive assessment in FLS is based on 75 multiple-choice questions, a proctored examination is used for the manual skills assessment which includes five tasks to be performed in a portable pelvic trainer box with built-in video camera: bimanual peg transfer, precise pattern cutting, use of ligating loops and suturing with intracorporeal and extracorporeal knot tying. In spite of the growing popularity of the FLS, there are several major problems with this box trainer paradigm: (1) the assessment is subjective, (2) there is no feedback during learning except when an experienced trainer is present, (3) a large number of qualified proctors must be engaged during test taking, (4) the training material must be constantly replaced, and (5) the test-takers must travel to one of the 27 Regional Test Centers or the Annual SAGES meeting or the ACS Clinical Congress. To overcome these problems and to enable greater dissemination, we propose to develop and validate a Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST) whereby tasks available in the FLS may be performed on PCs and laptops with inexpensive haptic (touch) interface devices, such as the Phantom(R) OmniTM. To develop the VBLaST a novel set of technologies must be developed including rapid, but highly realistic physics-based virtual interaction paradigms and statistical machine learning techniques to develop a ""virtual mentor"" which will provide real time automated feedback to the trainees. A comprehensive set of studies involving students, residents, fellows and practicing surgeons at Boston area hospitals (e.g., BIDMC, Tufts Medical Center, Cambridge Health Alliance, Harvard, MGH, Brigham & Women's, Lahey Clinic) will be undertaken to test the validity of the VBLaST as a training tool and establish its usefulness in transferring the acquired skills to the operating room. Once validated, the VBLaST will have exponential impact in reducing training costs and training time while improving patient safety and outcomes, A multidisciplinary team with collective expertise in physics-based interactive medical simulation, laparoscopic surgery and surgical education, and human factors engineering has been assembled to achieve the following Specific Aims: SA1) To develop a realistic virtual basic laparoscopic skill trainer (VBLaST) platform to perform all the tasks available in the FLS training tool box.

"Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmentation of detailed, patient-specific models from medical imagery can provide invaluable assistance for surgical planning and navigation. Current segmentation methods often make errors when confronted with subtle intensity boundaries. Adding knowledge of expected shape of a structure, and the range of normal variations in shape, can greatly improve segmentation, by guiding it towards the most likely shape consistent with the image information. The resulting segmentations can be used to plan surgical procedures, and when registered to the patient, can provide navigational guidance around critical structures. Many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and Fetal Growth Restriction, affect the shape of specific anatomical areas. To understand the development and progression of these diseases, as well as to develop methods for classifying instances into diseased or normal classes, 1 needs methods that capture differences in shape distributions between populations. Our goal is to develop and validate methods for learning from images concise representations of anatomical shape and its variability, Modeling shape distributions will improve segmentation algorithms by biasing the search towards more likely shapes.

"Developing computerized tools for cryosurgery planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Cryosurgery has been known as an invasive surgical technique since 1961, when Cooper and Lee invented the first cryoprobe. In the 1990s, new developments in Joule-Thomson cooling (the cooling effect associated with a sudden relief of a pressurized gas) led to a dramatic decrease in the size of cryoprobes and an increase in the number of cryoprobes that could be used simultaneously. A dozen or more cryoprobes operating simultaneously in a single prostate cryosurgery is already common practice. If localized effectively, one of the primary benefits of using a large number of miniaturized cryoprobes is superior control over the freezing process.   Currently, the process of selecting the correct placement of the cryoprobes for a specific procedure is an art held by the cryosurgeon, based on the surgeon's own experience and rules of thumb. Cryoprobes are typically operated in a trial-and-error fashion, until the entire target volume is thought to be frozen. Currently, there are no means to determine the optimal locations for the cryoprobes. Suboptimal cryoprobe localization may leave regions in the target volume unfrozen, may lead to cryoinjury of healthy surrounding tissues, may require an unnecessarily large number of cryoprobes, may increase the duration of the surgical procedure, and may increase the likelihood of post cryosurgery complications, all of which affect the quality and cost of the medical treatment. Computerized planning tools would help to alleviate these difficulties.   The ""cryoheater,"" a new device for cryosurgery control has recently been presented by the research team. The cryoheater is a temperature controlled electrical heater. In broad terms, cryoheaters can dramatically increase the ability to control the shape and size of the frozen region, however, to achieve the full benefits of cryoheaters, computerized planning tools for cryoheater localization are necessary.   Our goal is to develop computerized planning tools for cryosurgery that are suitable for all available cooling techniques. The proposed research includes: (1) Development of an efficient numerical scheme for bioheat transfer simulations of cyroprocedures, (2) Development of an efficient optimization technique based on a force-field analogy. (3) Development of knowledge-based optimization techniques. (4) Experimental verification of the planning tool.       Besides planning, another important application of the proposed tool is the training of cryosurgeons. The proposed tool will provide cryosurgeons with the ability to visualize the 3D volumetric nature of the freezing process.   Likewise, it will allow the surgeon to explore the performance of various configurations of cryoprobes and cryoheaters, and observe the defects that would result from each. Such visualization capabilities will provide surgeons with insights into the physics of cryosurgery that are difficult to obtain from physical experiments or surgical practice.         n/a",Developing computerized tools for cryosurgery planning,7210691,R01EB003563,"['Affect', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Catheters', 'Computational Technique', 'Condition', 'Cool-X-A', 'Cryosurgery', 'Defect', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Europe', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Furuncles', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Heating', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Invasive', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modems', 'Nature', 'Nitrogen', 'Numbers', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Placement', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Thinking', 'Thumb structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experience', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'miniaturize', 'research study', 'simulation', 'size', 'thermal seeds', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIBIB,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,87443,0.03206718588003559
"Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmentation of detailed, patient-specific models from medical imagery can provide invaluable assistance for surgical planning and navigation.

"Mini Bone-Attached Robot for Joint Arthroplasty DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Medical robotics has the potential to revolutionize how surgical procedures on bony anatomy are performed. It can assist surgeons by preparing bones much more accurately than mechanical guides or freehand cutting. It can help improve patient outcomes by decreasing surgical errors. In the orthopaedics community, though, medical robots have not been very successful due to a variety of issues ranging from robot size, to surgical time, and soft-tissue difficulties. We propose to overcome these difficulties by utilizing a miniature robotic milling device that attaches directly to the bone.      Realizing the potential of minimally invasive procedures, the implant industry is currently in the process of redesigning implants and, together with surgeons, reexamining surgical procedures. It can be expected that the next generation of implants will be smaller and more suitable for eventual development of less invasive procedures. One example of such procedures in knee arthroplasty is patellofemoral resurfacing of the knee. Without lose of generality we will examine the capability of the robot in improving the accuracy of the femoral-component preparation for patellofemoral arthroscopy. From engineering point of this procedure simulates the future generation of orthopaedic arthroplasty where there will be a need to machine bone surface into a more complex shape that is not planar or spherical but complex surfaces. Therefore, the technology demonstrated by this research, though, will not be specific to the patellofemoral procedure, and will be adaptable to many other areas.      We propose to develop a miniature robot that will be rigidly affixed directly to the bone. The robot itself will scan the shape of the femur directly, removing any need for preoperative imaging or intraoperative registration and tracking of the bone. With the additional input of the direction of patellar tracking, we will automatically optimize the planned position of the implant to ensure that it is properly aligned and congruent with the surrounding healthy cartilage. Congruency is a requirement for this procedure to make certain that the patellar component does not impinge on the edge of the femoral component and lead to early failure of the implant. The robot will then mill out the cavity to within 1mm of the planned location, guaranteeing complete coverage of the area with a defined surface uniformity.      By validating the results generated with the proposed robot, first on wax blocks and then plastic bone phantoms, porcine bones, and finally on cadaver knees, we will show that the robot can deliver the accuracy required to precisely place the implant. This precise placement of the femoral component should reduce the possibility of impingement, patellar maltracking, and component loosening, and improve patient outcomes. n/a",Mini Bone-Attached Robot for Joint Arthroplasty,7117290,R01AR052700,"['arthroplasty', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'femur', 'hip prosthesis', 'image guided surgery /therapy', 'joint prosthesis', 'knee', 'medical implant science', 'miniature biomedical equipment', 'phantom model', 'postmortem', 'robotics']",NIAMS,WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL,R01,2006,140714,0.09154945101365163

"3D Telestration for Robotically Assisted Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The speed with which an innovative and improved surgical procedure can be widely adopted is governed principally by the availability of competent surgeon mentors. With its difficult learning curve, minimally invasive surgery has an especially strong need for mentors. Several investigators have developed ""telestration,"" the ability for a remote surgeon mentor to draw on the operating surgeon's video display, to make surgical mentoring available over long distances to increase the availability of mentors. Robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery such as that practiced with the da Vinci surgical robot has the same basic need for mentors, with two special circumstances that amplify the need for mentors: robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery is in its earlier stages, with few qualified mentors, and due to the surgeon's immersion at a control console with a high-fidelity 3D display, a mentor is in a sense ""remote"" even if he or she is in the same room. Both of these special circumstances make telestration even more attractive for robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery than it is for conventional minimally invasive surgery.      The proposed project would meet this challenge by leveraging another aspect of the surgical robot system - the presence of computational power- to apply image correlation algorithms to render 3D telestration drawings from drawings produced in 2D by the mentor. The same image correlation algorithms used to generate the 3D telestration also offer a second major benefit - the ability to virtually ""paint"" the telestration drawings on the anatomy in the surgeon's 3D view, so that the markings made by the mentor move with the anatomy, appearing to have been made with a paint pen directly on the tissue. In addition to the two immediate benefits of generating 3D telestration and creating drawings that track anatomy, application of these algorithms has broad potential impact in the area of image-guided surgery. n/a",3D Telestration for Robotically Assisted Surgery,6831980,R41EB004177,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'image guided surgery /therapy', 'robotics', 'swine', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography']",NIBIB,"INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.",R41,2004,105941,0.12542532934908002
"Automatic Counting System for Items Used in Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aim of this work is to develop a technological means to improve the reliability of counting instruments and other items used in surgical operations. This work will directly result in improved clinical outcomes by reducing or eliminating the occurrence of retained foreign bodies following surgery. The inadvertent retention of a foreign body such as a surgical instrument in a patient's body cavity or incision following a surgical procedure continues to be a dangerous and costly accident. Counting is an error-prone process that can be affected by increasing stress and confusion levels that may occur in emergencies or unplanned changes in the surgical procedure. It is hypothesized that an Automatic Counting System would add a level of security beyond that provided by human counting alone. In Phase I, we will determine the feasibility of several candidate-counting technologies for reducing errors. The candidate technologies are computer-vision, radiofrequency-identification tagging and precision weighing of items used in the surgical operation. The Phase I work will be in two parts. The first part is the experimental measurement of the error rates of the individual candidate technologies in terms of identifying and counting surgical instruments and other items used in operations. The second part is a computer simulation using probabilistic methods applied to a mathematical model of the Automatic Counting System that incorporates the candidate technologies. The simulation will be used to determine how well these candidate technologies perform at reducing overall errors when integrated into the whole system. In Phase II, we will continue this work to arrive at a commercially available and clinically usable product.         n/a",Automatic Counting System for Items Used in Surgery,6832636,R43NR009129,"['biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'health services research tag', 'injury prevention', 'mathematical model', 'patient safety /medical error', 'surgery material /equipment', 'technology /technique development']",NINR,"ROBOTIC SURGICAL TECH, INC.",R43,2004,100000,0.11265619749502676

They could be incorporated         into existing clinical instruments without the need for precise calibration,         which is often not possible anyway, because the patient's anatomy (e.g., the         eye) is part of the imaging system.                                                                                                                                       The algorithms will be validated in the context of laser retinal surgery -           compelling as the only long-term proven treatment for the leading blindness-         causing conditions affecting over 20 million people in the US.  Yet, the             current success rate of this procedure is less than 50%, largely due to the          lack of spatial mapping and navigation aids in current clinical instruments.

"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10066989,F31NS115447,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'candidate identification', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'structured data', 'tool', 'vector']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2020,39617,0.07696037417862629
"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS. The candidate for this award Dr. Haoyin Zhou is a postdoc at Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Zhou has extensive experience and expertise in computer vision, machine learning and their applications in medicine. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. National Center for Image Guided Therapy, and Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite will greatly support this research. Dr. Zhou’s long-term research goal is to develop and apply advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of medical image processing and image-guided therapy. To achieve these goals, Dr. Zhou plans to receive more education and training in the following four areas: (1) Critical training in conducting translational research in the hospital environment with surgeons and radiologists, (2) knowledge in the development of technologies for surgical guidance, (3) training in machine learning and its applications in medicine, and (4) training on writing grant applications independently and seeking funding. Dr. Zhou will participate in formal courses selected from Harvard, Harvard Catalyst, MIT CSAIL and Stanford Courses. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH, HMS and MIT. He will also attend one or two academic conferences per year to discuss his work and meet with experts in the field. A strong mentoring team, including one primary mentor, three co-mentors, and two collaborators, has been organized for the K99 phase of this award, which will provide solid support on both research and career development to Dr. Zhou based on their well-established expertise in diverse research fields. Prof. William M. Wells III (primary mentor) is a professor in medical image processing. Prof. Jayender Jagadeesan (co-mentor) is an assistant professor in surgical robotics and surgical navigation. Drs. Ali Tavakkoli and Jiping Wang (co- mentors) are experienced surgeons. All mentors and collaborators are from BWH, HMS. Project Narrative  Minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS) has many potential advantages but liver deformation leads to significant difficulties in localizing tumors and avoiding main vessels accurately. This project aims to develop a novel surgical navigation approach as a tool to guide MILS intraoperatively.

"Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CANDIDATE (Andrew J. Hung, MD): My long-term goal is to establish a career in innovating training methods for robotic surgery which will lead to curtailing surgeon learning curve, and maximize patient safety. My first step towards that goal focuses on understanding objective metrics that measure surgeon performance, and how machine learning algorithms can process that data to guide training. I have developed a career development program that builds on my clinical training in robotic urologic surgery and prior research in surgical training. Through mentorship, a fellowship, and formal coursework, this K23 award will provide me the necessary support to develop expertise in 3 areas where I do not have formal training, yet are critical to my success: (1) Machine learning; (2) Surgical education; (3) Advanced statistical skills and study design. MENTORING TEAM: My career development and research plans leverage existing institutional resources, including the USC Machine Learning Center, led by co-primary mentor Dr. Yan Liu; and Keck Hospital of USC, the second busiest robotic center by volume in the United States and the USC Institute of Urology (led by co- primary mentor and chairman Dr. Inderbir Gill), home to pioneers of several urologic surgical techniques with a robust research apparatus supporting several NIH-funded clinical scientists. My mentoring team is complemented by co-mentor Dr. Robert Sweet, a DOD-funded expert on surgical education; career mentor Dr. Larissa Rodriguez, a federally funded clinician/scientist experienced in mentoring K awardees; educational psychology collaborator Dr. Kenneth Yates, an authority on cognitive task analysis; and consultant Dr. Anthony Jarc, at Intuitive Surgical who has supported much of the pilot data on objective performance metrics. The proposed K23 work truly requires the robust collaboration of experts in robotic surgery, education, and machine learning. RESEARCH: The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is steep: over 100 cases. Current ‘gold standard’ methods of surgical assessment rely on subjective expert review, but such evaluations are time consuming and inconsistent. Nonetheless, credentialing a surgeon to perform robotic surgery has enormous implications - patient outcomes are at risk, and a surgeon’s career is on the line. Informed by my clinical expertise in robotic urological surgery and preliminary data, I will develop a novel method of utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to objectively assess robotic surgeon performance and to guide training for the vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA), the most critical reconstructive part of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). I will develop and validate objective metrics directly captured from the da Vinci robot during the VUA (Aim 1), train machine learning algorithms to assess a surgeon’s performance of VUA (Aim 2), and utilize ML algorithms to guide surgeons learning the VUA (Aim 3). Armed with these data and skills from this award, I will be uniquely suited to utilize machine learning to generalize objective surgeon assessment for robot-assisted surgical procedures within and beyond urology. Finally, the results from this study will provide preliminary data for independent funding through mechanisms such as an NIH R01 grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer is steep, and current methods of evaluating surgeons require subjective and time-consuming expert review. Streamlined training and assessment utilizing objective performance metrics and machine learning algorithms can significantly curtail learning curve with patients, and decrease the overall morbidity of prostate cancer treatment.",Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy,9982955,K23EB026493,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Chairperson', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Credentialing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational Psychology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urethra', 'Urologic Surgical Procedures', 'Urology', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive task', 'common treatment', 'complex data ', 'computer program', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'peer', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'robot assistance', 'skills', 'success', 'task analysis', 'urologic', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality simulation']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K23,2020,192304,0.0528508391144663
"Quantifying the Metrics of Surgical Mastery: An Exploration in Data Science PROJECT SUMMARY In surgery, it is accepted that there may be a ten to twenty-year learning curve to reach mastery for certain procedures. We believe this timeline can and should be shortened to improve patient care. Our short-term goal is to make a major contribution to the emerging field of Surgical Data Science by building a database of mastery level surgical performance and generating a roadmap for multimodal data collection and analysis procedures. Sharing our process, procedures and results broadly, will help to change measurement culture in healthcare. Through our newly developed partnership (October 2019) with the American College of Surgeons, we have already experienced early success in starting the conversation through the “Surgical Metrics Project” (https://www.facs.org/education/surgical-metrics). Using a standardized data collection platform (a mastery-level hernia simulation), we will deploy and synchronize multiple data capture approaches (motion tracking, video, audio and validated surgical performance checklists) to build our database. Data analysis will quantify surgical mastery and consist of new applications and discoveries in machine learning. Hypothesis: Using multiple, synchronized data capture approaches and machine learning, it is possible to create a database of mastery level surgical strategies that can be translated into a value-added, surgical navigation tool for surgeons. To test this hypothesis, we will empirically investigate the following paraphrased aims: SPECIFIC AIM 1: Quantify surgical mastery (cognitive and technical) during a simulated laparoscopic ventral hernia (LVH) repair by using a post-procedure analysis of multi-modal performance metrics captured from hospital credentialed surgeons (N~125). SPECIFIC AIM 2: Establish validity evidence for surgical mastery metrics by comparing simulation-based LVH performance with operating room LVH performance from the same surgeons (N~60). SPECIFIC AIM 3: Empirically investigate the best implementation strategy for utilization of a surgical navigation tool designed to deliver value-added information regarding mastery-level surgical performance strategies to a new group of hospital credentialed surgeons (N~125). PROJECT NARRATIVE The significance of this study is the opportunity to make a major contribution to the emerging field of Surgical Data Science by: 1) Generating a large multimodal dataset that can be de-identified and shared and 2) Providing a roadmap for predicting and supporting operative mastery with an artificial intelligence powered decision tool.",Quantifying the Metrics of Surgical Mastery: An Exploration in Data Science,10053113,R01DK123445,"['Address', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Credentialing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Feeds', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hernia', 'Hospitals', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Motion', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Specialties', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Ventral Hernia', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive skill', 'data framework', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'design', 'early experience', 'force sensor', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'motion sensor', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'repaired', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,671082,0.16174123007233795
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes.

"Biomedical Informatics Tools for Applied Perioperative Physiology Project Summary / Abstract Even though US hospitals have widely adopted electronic health record (EHR) documentation of patient care, interoperability of these systems remains an issue, leading to challenges in data integration. In the operating room (OR) setting, during surgery, physiological waveforms (arterial pressure, EKG, SpO2, central venous pressure, etc.) represent a large source of information used by clinical monitors to extract and display information in order for healthcare providers to make clinical decisions. Integration and synchronization of high-quality EHR and physiological waveform data in large datasets of surgical patients would allow machine learning and deep learning approaches to plumb these datasets for clinically relevant signatures that would promote advanced OR patient monitoring systems to define present state, predict state trajectory, suggest effective counter measures to minimize patients decompensated states, and define the usefulness and efficacy of new monitoring devices. The objective of this proposal is to focus the resources of an interdisciplinary team from academia (University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Irvine (UCI), and Carnegie Mellon University Computer Sciences), industry (Edwards Lifesciences Critical Care), and clinical medicine (anesthesiology, surgery, and critical care at UCLA, UCI, Beth Israel, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) to create, develop, and organize large surgical datasets combining EHR and high fidelity physiological waveform data, to make these datasets freely accessible, and to develop new predictive/forecasting monitoring systems for the surgical patients. The study will begin with the development of a machine learning algorithm to predict cardiovascular collapse during surgery. This algorithm development will be based on physiological signatures predictive of cardiovascular collapse identified in the animal models of shock. The study hypothesis is that the combination of two separate OR databases containing EHR and physiological waveforms will allow for training and development of monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database. The surgical setting is relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted annually to an Intensive Care Unit, more than 50 million undergo surgery. OR databases are unique in medicine because: 1) Changes occur quickly and the lead-time before an event is compressed; 2) Knowledge of baseline/pre-stress status of surgical patients allows normalization, calibration, and markedly enhances prediction; 3) Continuous and immediate presence of dense skilled acute care practitioners allows faster implementation of complex treatment algorithms in the OR; and 4) Defined stages, procedures, and stressors allow building large common relational database registries. By helping to focus the provider's attention on significant events and changes in the patient's state and by suggesting physiological interpretations of that state, such systems will permit early detection of complex problems and provide guidance on therapeutic interventions improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative The objective of this proposal is to focus the resources of an interdisciplinary team from academia (University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Irvine (UCI), and Carnegie Mellon University Computer Sciences), industry (Edwards Lifesciences Critical Care), and clinical medicine (anesthesiology, surgery, and critical care at UCLA, UCI, Beth Israel, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) to create, develop, and organize large surgical datasets combining electronic health record and high-fidelity physiological waveform data, to make these datasets freely accessible, and to develop new predictive/forecasting monitoring systems for the surgical patients. We hypothesize that the combination of two separate OR databases containing electronic health record and physiological waveforms will allow us and other investigators to train and develop monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database.

"Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Abstract While virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation technology is being developed to improve laparoscopic surgical training outside the operating room (OR), existing simulators focus mostly on technical skills (TS) of hand-eye coordination for isolated tasks and seldom on non-technical skills (NTS) associated with both cognitive skills of decision making, as well as interpersonal skills of communication, team-work and conflict resolution. To enable VR-based surgical simulators to also train for cognitive skills, in the previous grant period we successfully developed the next generation (Gen2) of laparoscopic surgical simulators that immerse the trainee in a virtual OR using a head-mounted display (HMD) system, and introduce distractions, interruptions and other stressors to capture the high-stress environment of the real OR. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no VR-based simulator for training interpersonal skills needed for the multidisciplinary integration of OR teams, which consist of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and perioperative nurses. Following the significant reduction of adverse events in other disciplines, such as aviation, by the introduction of mandatory simulation-based team training (e.g., crew resource management), the National Surgical Skills Curriculum developed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) has prescribed ten team-based training modules to be performed in a simulation facility (e.g., an OR endosuite) with scenario-based training on high- fidelity manikin simulators. However, such facility-based team training is extremely expensive and cumbersome, requires dedicated facility and faculty time, and entails significant planning and schedule coordination between trainees, technicians, and faculty. To overcome the challenges of facility-based OR team training, the goal of this project is to extend the immersive VR technology (Gen2) developed as part of our prior grant for a single user to the entire OR team, and harness recent advances in cloud computing, mobile device-based VR and artificial intelligence and machine learning to design, develop and evaluate a Virtual Operating Room Team Experience (VORTeX) simulation system. The VORTeX will allow the OR team to train together in a distributed fashion (i.e., not co-located in the same room or simulation facility) wearing mobile device-based HMD systems to develop further their NTS based on computer-generated simulation scenarios replacing the physical ones. Evaluation of the simulation scenarios will be performed asynchronously by a team of experts based on post-action replays. We will implement the VORTeX for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy crisis scenario, developed and validated by our Co-I Dr. Dan Jones at BIDMC and adopted as one of the team training modules of the ACS/APDS national surgical skills curriculum. We hypothesize that the VORTeX will be at least as good as or better than traditional facility-based simulation in providing non-technical skills training to OR teams. Project Narrative: The goal of this research is to develop and validate a comprehensive computer-based technology that will allow surgical trainees to practice their surgical skills on computer-based models. Surgical procedures and techniques, learnt and perfected in this risk-free manner before application to patients, will translate to fewer operating room errors, reduced patient morbidity and improved patient outcomes resulting in faster healing, shorter hospital stay and reduced post surgical complications and treatment costs.",Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery,9969824,R01EB005807,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Aviation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Board Certification', 'Boston', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Floor', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Internet', 'Interruption', 'Israel', 'Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Medical center', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative Nursing', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Software Framework', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cognitive skill', 'cognitive training', 'computer generated', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'distraction', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'eye hand coordination', 'handheld mobile device', 'head mounted display', 'healing', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interactive computing', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'simulation environment', 'skills', 'skills training', 'stressor', 'success', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual surgery']",NIBIB,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,646125,0.11617040260822742
"Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data Project Summary For epileptic patients who undergo brain resection or ablation interventions, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate seizure status, whether controlled or relapsed. Yet, it is data from the preoperative brain that drives the postoperative prediction process – a critical process for both patient and doctor, and one that is only clinically meaningful when seizure outcomes are predicted presurgically to optimize surgical-decision making. Accordingly, we propose to develop a multi-step model that will establish more accurate predictors of post- surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) emphasizing post-surgical status, for it is the areas of the brain spared during surgery that form the neural substrates generating postoperative seizures. A second perspective motivating our project is the need to identify those changes in functional and structural brain network organization that support adaptive versus maladaptive seizure outcomes following brain surgery. These are the network changes (e.g., the new seizure generators) that dispose and place a potential surgical candidate on a specific outcome trajectory. Therefore, identifying the phenotypes of brain reorganization and change, and incorporating their status into presurgical predictive models of outcome will likely prove crucial to enhancing our ability to predict postoperative neuroplastic responses. While existing outcome prediction models in TLE have focused on clinical variables (e.g., lesional status), we choose instead to focus on structural and functional measures of network reorganization (communication dynamics, regional interactions, structural control). This stems from our belief that capturing network changes throughout the whole postsurgical brain offers a better practical method for identifying and predicting the latent seizure foci (epileptogenesis) that will emerge after surgery. Through machine learning techniques we will deliver an algorithm to be used with new, potential surgical patients, an algorithm that utilizes solely presurgical data, but incorporates our innovative prediction about postsurgical brain organization. Accordingly, our approach provides both a methodologic and conceptual (reorganization phenotypes) advance. The scientific premise leading to our hypotheses is that the failure in the literature to account for the impact of unresected/ablated brain regions, and the brain reorganizations these areas compel, has seriously impeded the predictive power of previous outcome models. Project Narrative For epileptic patients undergoing brain surgery, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate whether seizures are controlled or not. Accordingly, we propose to develop a model that predicts post-surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy, emphasizing the reorganization and change in brain network communication and control that comes with post-surgical status, for it is these features that will actually generate postsurgical seizures. Our innovation is the use of post-operative brain reorganization phenotypes to predict on a presurgical basis who will be disposed to a good vs poor outcome trajectory, highlighting that it is the failure to account for the impact of spared regions, and the brain organization changes these compel, which has seriously impeded the predictive power of prior outcome models.",Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data,9966055,R01NS112816,"['Ablation', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Generalized Epilepsy', 'Health Personnel', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organizational Change', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Thalamic structure', 'Work', 'base', 'brain surgery', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'surgery outcome']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,442761,0.06321193919346639
"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",9846016,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data streams', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'simulation environment', 'stressor', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,648089,0.03936702433465303
"Task-aware and Autonomous Robotic C-arm Servoing for Flouroscopy-guided Interventions Project Summary Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is used in more than 17 million procedures across the US and constitutes the state-of-care for various percutaneous procedures, including internal ﬁxation of pelvic ring injuries. To infer procedural progress from 2D radiographs, well-deﬁned views onto anatomy must be achieved and restored multiple times during surgery. This process, known as ”ﬂuoro hunting”, is associated with 4.7 s of excessive ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm position (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), yielding radiographs that are never interpreted clinically, but drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical staff.  Our long-term project goal is to use concepts from machine learning and active vision to develop task-aware algorithms for autonomous robotic C-arm servoing that interpret intra-operative radiographs and autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to acquire ﬂuoroscopic images that are optimal for inference. We have three speciﬁc aims: 1) Detecting unfavorable K-wire trajectories from monoplane ﬂuoroscopy images: We will extend a physics-based sim- ulation framework for ﬂuoroscopy from CT that enables fast generation of structured and realistic radiographs documenting procedural progress. Based on this data, we will train a state-of-the-art convolutional neural net- work that interprets ﬂuoroscopic images to infer procedural progress. 2) Developing and validating a task-aware imaging system in silico: Using the autonomous interpretation tools and simulation pipeline available through Aim 1, we will train an artiﬁcial agent based on reinforcement learning and active vision. This agent will be capable of analyzing intra-operative ﬂuoroscopic images to autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to yield task- optimal views onto anatomy. 3) Demonstrating feasibility of our task-aware imaging concept ex vivo: Our third aim will establish task-aware C-arm imaging in controlled clinical environments. We will attempt internal ﬁxation of anterior pelvic ring fractures and our task-aware artiﬁcial agent will interpret intra-operatively acquired ra- diographs to infer procedural progress and suggest optimal C-arm poses that will be realized manually with an optically-tracked mobile C-arm system.  This work combines the expertise of a computer scientist, a surgical robotics expert, and an orthopedic trauma surgeon to explore the untapped, understudied area of autonomous imaging enabled by advances in machine learning in ﬂuoroscopy-guided procedures. This development has only recently been made feasible by innovations in fast ﬂuoroscopy simulation from CT to provide structured data for training that is sufﬁciently realistic to warrant generalization to clinical data. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to investigate autonomous and task-aware C-arm imaging systems, paving the way for a new paradigm in medical image acquisition, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients by task-oriented image acquisition on a patient-speciﬁc basis. Subsequent R01 funding will customize this concept to other high-volume procedures, such as vertebroplasty. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is the state-of-care for percutaneous fracture ﬁxation, and requires surgeons to achieve and reproduce well deﬁned views onto anatomy to infer procedural progress. This requirement alone is estimated to contribute 4.7 s of ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm repositioning (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical team.

"Patient specific 3D printed tissue engineered vascular graft for aortic reconstruction designed by artificial intelligence algorithm. 1 The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered  2 vascular grafts (TEVG) for use in aortic arch repair surgery. These TEVGs are optimized for high pressure  3 circulation using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence, and will grow with the patient, in hopes of  4 obviating need for future surgeries to replace grafts, which can occur with contemporary arch reconstruction  5 materials. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death due to congenital anomalies. Despite  6 significant advances in surgical management for CHD, one significant source of morbidity and mortality arises  7 from the complexity of surgery for diverse anatomies in the aortic arch. Previous studies have demonstrated  8 that the resultant arch geometry after surgical reconstruction of stenotic or hypoplastic aortas is important to  9 minimize reduce energy loss and undesirable flow inside the arch, which can lead to hypertension, abnormal 10 vascular response and ventricular dysfunction. Ensuring a patient-specific graft design for ideal reconstructed 11 route before surgery with minimum energy loss and wall shear stress may yield long-term benefits for patient 12 health and quality of life. 13 We have demonstrated native vessel like neotissue formation of TEVG in small and large animal 14 studies. Based on these experiences, we have developed a novel 3D printing technology combining 3D printed 15 metal mandrels with nanofiber electro-spun technology. With this 3D printing technology, we showed that 16 TEVG developed native like neovessel formation in venous circulation in a sheep model. For this next step, we 17 aim to develop grafts in arterial circulation that can be applied to aortic reconstruction. We will also develop 18 automatic design algorithms to design optimal graft shape in order to reduce time and cost of patient specific 19 design. We hypothesize that patient-specific TEVG using our 3D printing technology can be designed, 20 aided by pre-operative imaging and flow data, computer assisted design (CAD), automatic design 21 algorithms based on computation fluid dynamics (CFD) results, and will demonstrate proper neotissue 22 formation and growth while maintaining optimally designed hemodynamics. 23 This project will be an important step towards clinical application of patient-specific vascular grafts that 24 recapitulate the native anatomy and mechanical properties. The results of this work will have a broader impact 25 on the design and fabrication of other more complex cardiovascular structures for implantation. This paradigm 26 shift in vascular graft technology will improve the quality and safety of pediatric patient care. The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered vascular grafts using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence for use in aortic arch repair surgery which demands a structured surgical approach in order to optimize hemodynamics postoperatively. We will optimize the design of an aortic graft automatically using computational flow dynamics, refine 3D printing manufacturing, evaluate grafts with in-vitro testing, and finally will test the performance of the grafts in vivo over time.

"Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Closed or open fracture reduction and internal fixation is the standard surgical approach in treating pelvic fractures, with current clinical practice using fluoroscopic guidance, guidewire insertion, and cannulated screw placement. The challenge in reckoning complex 3D morphology in 2D fluoroscopy presents a major source of uncertainty, trial-and- error, and poor outcomes, with 20-30% rate of suboptimal screw placement and long fluoroscopic runtime (mean fluoro time > 123 s) exposing operating personnel to high levels of radiation exposure. Despite these challenges, mainstream surgical approach has remained largely unchanged for 35 years, and surgical navigation systems (though increasingly common in neurosurgery) present cost and workflow barriers that limit their broad applicability in trauma surgery. We propose a computer vision-based navigation approach that is compatible with routine trauma surgery workflow, offers real-time guidance with accuracy comparable to stereotactic navigation, gives ten-fold reduction in radiation exposure, and works with tools already common in the trauma surgery arsenal. The proposed system uses a miniature stereoscopic camera mounted onboard the surgical drill in combination with 3D-2D registration of fluoroscopic views for direct, real-time registration of the instrument trajectory relative to patient anatomy. Real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views and/or CT permits accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within bone corridors and will reduce reliance on “fluoro hunting” and trial-and-error guidewire placement. The following aims develop and evaluate the system for application in pelvic trauma surgery, including quantitative assessment of accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose in pre-clinical studies. Aim 1. System for computer vision-based guidance in trauma surgery. The hardware and software components required for vision-based tracking onboard a standard surgical drill will be developed, providing real-time trajectory overlay in fluoroscopy and/or preoperative CT. A fast calibration method will be developed for automatic drill axis calibration. Automatic feature-based registration of the video and fluoroscopic frames enables real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views (Fluoro Navigation), and 3D-2D registration between CT and fluoroscopy will enable real-time overlay of the instrument trajectory in CT (CT Navigation). Aim 2: Evaluation in preclinical studies. The vision-based navigation system will be implemented in pre-clinical (cadaver) experiments to evaluate accuracy and workflow. These studies will evaluate the geometric accuracy and workflow factors relating to the number of repeated insertion attempts, procedure time, and radiation dose, evaluating vision-based Fluoro Navigation and CT Navigation in comparison to conventional freehand fluoroscopy guidance. Successful completion of the aims will establish a system suitable for computer vision-based navigation to be translated to clinical studies in future work. Such a system offers a potentially major advance in routine trauma surgery, bringing capabilities comparable to state-of-the-art stereotactic navigation without the cost, complexity, and additional workflow of conventional navigation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even experienced trauma surgeons are challenged in resolving the complex 3D morphology of the pelvis in 2D x-ray fluoroscopy, presenting a major source of uncertainty, a high rate of malpositioned screws, and high levels of radiation exposure to the patient and operating staff. To facilitate high-precision pelvic trauma surgery and reduce intraoperative radiation dose, we propose a computer vision-based navigation approach providing real-time overlay of surgical instrument trajectories in fluoroscopic views and CT, facilitating accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within safe bone corridors. The approach offers a major advance compared to conventional navigation by not requiring intraoperative 3D imaging, avoiding time-consuming calibration, and eliminating externally-positioned hardware in the operating room, and the proposed research translates the system from basic development and quantitative testing to preclinical studies evaluating geometric accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose.",Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery,10005337,R21EB028330,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Calibration', 'Clinical Research', 'Closed Fractures', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Mainstreaming', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Navigation System', 'Needles', 'Open Fractures', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Uncertainty', 'Visceral', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'neurovascular', 'pelvis fracture', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'sample fixation', 'socioeconomics', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,204688,0.03914720600871719
"Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers Superficially spreading types of skin cancers such as lentigo maligna melanomas (LMMs) and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) occur mostly on older patients, with diffuse sub-clinical sub-surface spread over large areas and with poorly defined margins that are difficult to detect. To treat these cancers, dermatologists rou- tinely perform a large number of mapping biopsies to determine the spread and margins, followed by surgical excision with wide ""safety"" margins. Not surprisingly, such a ""blind"" approach results in under-sampling of the margins, over-sampling of normal skin, too many false positives and false negatives, and too much loss of normal skin tissue. What may help address this problem is reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging to noninvasively delineate margins, directly on patients. RCM imaging detects skin cancers in vivo with sensitivity of 85-95% and specificity 80-70%. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted reim- bursement codes for RCM imaging of skin. RCM imaging is now being increasingly used to noninvasively guide diagnosis, sparing patients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. While the two-decade effort leading to the granting of these codes was focused on imaging-guided diagnosis, emerging applications are in imaging to guide therapy. We propose to create an approach called RCM video-mosaicking, to noninvasively map skin cancer margins over large areas on patients, with increased sampling, accuracy and sparing of nor- mal tissue. The innovation will be in designing a highly robust (against tissue warping and motion artifacts) and high speed (real-time, seconds) approach for RCM video-mosaicking: we will develop an optical flow ap- proach with a novel hybrid 3-stage deep learning network comprising of 8 parameters that will model global and local rigid and non-rigid tissue motion dynamics, learn and adapt to variable tissue and speckle noise con- ditions in patients, and predict and automatically detect motion blur artifacts. As required by PAR-18-009, our academic-industrial partnership will deliver RCM video-mosaicking to clinicians for real-time implementation at the bedside (translational novelty). Our proposed application is for guiding surgical excision, but the approach will have wider impact, for guiding new and emerging less invasive non-surgical treatments for superficial skin cancers. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated RCM video-mosaicking with real-time speed (125 millisec- onds per frame, 8 frames per second), and registration errors of 1.02 ± 1.3 pixels relative to field-of-view of 1000 x 1000 pixels. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a real-time and robust RCM video-mosaicking ap- proach and incorporate into a handheld confocal microscope for use at the bedside, (2) to test the approach for image quality and clinical acceptability, and (3) to prospectively test on 100 patients, with pre-surgical video- mosaicking of LMM margins and superficial NMSC margins, followed by validation against post-surgical pa- thology. We are a highly synergistic team from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern Uni- versity, and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.), with a 13-year record of collaboration. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging can noninvasively diagnose skin cancers, and spare patients from biopsies of benign skin conditions. We propose to develop an approach to noninvasively delineate skin cancer margins, to help guide less invasive surgery, and help more accurately and completely remove cancer while preserving more of the surrounding normal skin.",Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers,9951013,R01CA240771,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Dermatologist', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Excision', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Grant', 'Hutchinson&apos', 's Melanotic Freckle', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Video Microscopy', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'blind', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'design', 'expectation', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'older patient', 'preservation', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'vector']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,641884,0.056727875047081495
"Optical Coherence Elastography of the Cornea PROJECT SUMMARY The fundamental physical properties of the outer tunic of the eye determine the structural characteristics of the ocular globe and may be altered in several devastating disease states including axial elongation in myopia, pathological deformation in keratoconus, and iatrogenic keratoectasia following corneal refractive surgery. These biomechanical tissue characteristics not only influence our clinical interpretation of diagnostic tests, e.g. measurement of intraocular pressure, but have been implicated as important factors in the development of glaucoma. Currently, there is no available reliable method to perform quantitative measurement of corneal elasticity in vivo. Here we will develop novel method for the assessment of corneal elastic properties that could potentially be used for routine clinical diagnostic and treatment. This method will take advantages of highly localized air pressure stimulation and ultra-sensitive detection and analysis of the pressure waves propagation on corneal posterior and anterior surfaces with a line-field Optical Coherence Tomography to reconstruct volumetric biomechanical properties of the cornea. Our previous work has made fundamental advances in the understanding of corneal biomechanics through a novel approach with potentially impactful applications in other disciplines (e.g. cataract surgery, LAISK, corneal cross-linking, and tissue transplants with personalize treatments). The proposed studies will accelerate transition of this technology into clinics, influence our selection and application of corneal surgical treatments and will help us to understand the structural consequences of corneal disease and wound healing: Aim 1. Develop a line-field OCE (LF-OCE) system for ultrafast 3D clinical imaging. Aim 2. In vivo studies with rabbits. Aim 3. Preliminary clinical studies in humans. Aim 4. Refine numerical (FEM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models of the depth-dependent nonlinear viscoelastic properties of the cornea. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will focus on the development of novel technology and methods for noninvasive assessment of biomechanical properties of the cornea.

"Data-Driven Framework for Classification and Surgical Planning of Spinal Deformity. PROJECT SUMMARY Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) impacts 2-4% of the adolescent population. AIS causes a three- dimensional deformity of the spinal column affecting the patients’ normal motion and posture and may cause lung and heart dysfunction, early onset osteoarthritis, and disc degeneration if left untreated. Spinal fusion surgery in progressive cases of scoliosis remains the main treatment option. The variation in patients’ pre-operative characteristics, the surgical implants, and the surgical maneuvers have resulted in a wide range of surgical outcomes, 20% of which remains to be less than satisfactory. As the suboptimal surgical outcomes can significantly impact the cost, risk of revision surgery, and long-term rehabilitation of the adolescent patients, objective patient-specific models that can predict the outcome of different surgical treatment scenarios and determine the optimal surgical intervention for individuals are of critical need. The central hypothesis of the proposed work is that identifying the key features of a 3D spinal curve before the operation and the intraoperative surgical interventions the influence the long-term outcomes can provide a quantitative framework for predicting the surgical outcomes in this patient population. To this end, we propose (i) to identify the patient-specific and surgeon modifiable predictors of the spinal fusion outcomes in an in-house database of surgical AIS patients using machine learning, (ii) to develop a probabilistic predictive model of the outcomes as a function of pre-operative patient condition and the surgical interventions and (iii) to develop a fully automated framework that allows online image processing and assigns a treatment option that probabilistically determines the surgical outcome for a new patient based on a prior learning algorithm. The innovation of this approach is in developing the first data-driven predictive model for surgical planning of AIS patients that allows comparing different treatment scenarios through a probabilistic predictive framework and recommending surgical intervention that leads to an optimal outcome for a given patient. This knowledge-based algorithm automatically extracts the spinal curve patterns from the medical images as a classifier. The exploitation of an automated image processing algorithm to develop a reduced ordered model of the spinal deformity allows a fast quantitative analysis appropriate for direct clinical dissemination. It is aimed to use this model as an assistive tool for personalized surgical decision making of the AIS patients in the clinical setups. This assistive tool, which will be trained and tested using a large database of the medical images of the AIS patients, can make significant contribution to the field by developing a quantitative approach that considers a combinations of surgical methods and provides recommendations to achieve an improved outcome of the spinal deformity surgery in the pediatric population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe spinal deformity in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) requires surgical fusion of the spinal column in order to correct and stabilize the spine. Variations in the spinal deformity manifestation and treatment strategies have challenged the outcome prediction of the surgical intervention in this patient population, resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes in 20% of the surgically treated AIS patients. The scope of this work proposes and validates an objective data-driven algorithm for automated feature extraction, classification, and knowledge- based outcome prediction of AIS patients with a variety of spinal deformities using artificial intelligence methods.",Data-Driven Framework for Classification and Surgical Planning of Spinal Deformity.,9978391,R21AR075971,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Idiopathic scoliosis', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Spine surgery', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'adolescent patient', 'adverse outcome', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'early onset', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'implant design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'intervertebral disk degeneration', 'knowledge base', 'learning algorithm', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mathematical methods', 'neural network', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'satisfaction', 'scoliosis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,232320,0.15692416698558923
"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi-resolution imaging of the brain and spine while the surgeon operates.",An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System,10017876,R44CA112966,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Capital', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Michigan', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Monitor', 'Navigation System', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spine surgery', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Veterinary Schools', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cancer surgery', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cranium', 'deep neural network', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'neurosurgery', 'next generation', 'operation', 'point of care', 'portability', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spine bone structure', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2020,1279629,0.03005044101375438
"Post-surgical resection mapping in epilepsy using convolutional neural networks Project Summary Approximately one third of all individuals with epilepsy continue to have seizures despite treatment with anti- seizure medications. For these people, surgical removal of brain tissue can be a highly effective intervention to reduce or stop seizures. However, there is considerably variability in post-surgical seizure outcomes among individual patients, and the ability of physicians to predict who will benefit from surgery is limited. The location and extent of removed tissue, as well as neuroanatomical structures that are not surgically removed, are important factors that contribute to post-surgical outcomes. The goal of this proposal is to use convolutional neural networks, also known as deep learning, to map both the location and extent of surgically removed tissue on postsurgical MRI scans. The technique will also be used to automatically label brain regions that are spared during the surgical procedure. These computational tools will allow researchers to develop improved methods to predict postsurgical health outcomes. We will develop the automated method by training convolutional neural networks to identify brain regions on MRI scans obtained after epilepsy surgery at the New York University Langone Medical Center. CNNs have been specifically designed for the identification of complex spatial patterns in images and are likely to be well-suited to the identifications of changes in the brain following surgery. Recent developments in computer hardware and analysis methods mean that CNNs can now be applied to high resolution three-dimensional MRI scans. This project will leverage these recent developments in computational image analysis to improve our ability to predict outcomes following epilepsy surgery and therefore contribute to improved treatment for epilepsy patients. Project Narrative This project will use recently developed computational deep learning methods to identify neuroanatomical changes in individuals who have undergone brain surgery for treatment of medically refractory epilepsy.

"Real-time non-intrusive workload monitoring-Integration of human factors in surgery training and assessment Project Summary/Abstract (30 lines)  High physiological and cognitive workload required in de-coupled surgical work demands may have significant impact on patient outcome, surgical efficacy, and surgical performance. As novel surgical techniques, e.g., telesurgery, are developed, surgical operations will become more complex and the mental and physical demand on surgeons will likely increase, making it critical to develop remote and connected workload monitoring methods for the safe and effective surgical procedure design, testing, and training. This work will implement novel technology and machine learning analytics to quantify real-time and remote workload and test how workload feedback can impact care delivery in both in telesurgery and surgical simulation environments. Our overall hypothesis is that connected sensing technology in telesurgical procedures and simulation can improve surgical training and understanding of the impact of their workload on performance; ultimately improving patient health, surgery efficacy, and patient access (e.g., tele-mentoring) to surgical care. Two specific aims are proposed to investigate this hypothesis.  The objective of Specific Aim 1 is to develop a connected sensor system to objectively quantify workload real-time in simulated telerobotic procedures. This involves: 1) integrating non-intrusive sensors into a single system within the simulation trainer or environment, 2) training machine learning techniques to objectively distinguish workload using a simulated surgical skills tasks, and 3) validating metrics across varying levels of cognitive loads under various task difficulty with medical trainees and expert participants.  The objective of Specific Aim 2 is to determine the impact of the real-time workload feedback intervention on trainee performance times, errors, and intraoperative workload. Two tasks are proposed: 1) Explore modalities preferred by surgeons for providing real-time feedback on workload and 2) Assess impact of workload feedback on task performance and learning. Our primary hypothesis is that performance times and errors will improve when participants are provided realtime feedback on workload compared to performance with no feedback.  The expected deliverables include 1) workload monitoring technology, algorithms, and software for complementing current simulation-based training, 2) objective and automated workload metrics, 3) real-time assistive intervention tool, and 4) preliminary evidence on impact of workload monitoring on training. The technology in this proposed work will improve public health by reducing adverse events due to human factors in surgery and improve access to surgical care with intervention technology that can adaptively train surgeons and remotely assess proficiency. Project Narrative High physiological and cognitive workload required in de-coupled surgical work demands may have significant impact on patient outcome, surgical efficacy, and surgical team performance. Our overall hypothesis is that connected sensing technology, machine learning analytics, and real-time user-centered feedback on cognitive and physiological workload in telesurgical procedures and simulation can improve surgical training and understanding of the impact of their workload on performance; ultimately improving patient health, surgery efficacy, and patient access to surgical care.

"Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long term goal is to reduce postoperative infections. We will start by developing a system to accurately and completely identify their occurrence by applying machine learning algorithms to electronic health record (EHR) data. We will utilize a comprehensive audit and feedback system to create reports of risk-adjusted rates and specific details of postoperative infectious complications that are shared with surgeons and other healthcare providers to facilitate their awareness. We call this system the Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN). ASPIN will be piloted in the four major hospitals of the University of Colorado Health system (UCHealth) with a combined surgical volume of approximately 80,000 patients per year. We expect this will supersede the costly and laborious manual partial sampling of postoperative infectious complications which is current utilized by many hospitals. Specific Aim 1. Expand and enhance models for preoperative risk prediction and postoperative identification of surgical infections using EHR and ACS NSQIP data from patients who underwent operations at four UCHealth hospitals.  Specific Aim 1a) Enhance previously-developed models for identification of postoperative infections by controlling Type-I errors via “knockoffs,” a recent statistical innovation for high dimensional model selection using false discovery rate correction. Specific Aim 1b) Deploy natural language processing methods using EHR text reports of these patients to identify additional indicators of postoperative infections and further refine the models. Specific Aim 1c) Create preoperative risk models for infection using EHR data - similar to the models  implemented in the AHRQ-funded Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System - but that do not require  additional data entry by the health care providers. Specific Aim 2. From the beginning of the study, develop ASPIN with input from an Advisory Committee composed of administrators and surgeons from all four UCHealth hospitals. Additional feedback from surgeons will be obtained through focus groups and semi-structured interviews at several steps of ASPIN development and implementation planning. Specific Aim 3. A pilot implementation of ASPIN will utilize the RE-AIM framework to guide and examine the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of ASPIN at UCHealth. We will recruit 30 surgeon participants from all four UCHealth hospitals to use ASPIN, and we will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of ASPIN.  This research responds to AHRQ priorities by utilizing existing data to develop a learning health system with a distinct focus on improving surveillance and reporting of postoperative healthcare-associated infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious complications of surgery (surgical site infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and sepsis) are common, occurring in about 8% of major surgical procedures, and are costly. Currently used surveillance techniques require extensive human participation, resulting in delays of at least six months before the data are available to care providers, and the data represent only a small sample of all operations. We propose to develop a machine learning-based, near real-time recurring audit and feedback system for identification of postoperative infections that will inform providers about infectious outcomes of their patients.",Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN),10117905,R01HS027417,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,392599,0.005714893376016778
"Neurosurgical Planning with Robust Eloquent area Delineation from Individualized Connectivity-based Techniques (NeuroPREDICT) Project Summary/Abstract  The idiosyncrasies of the human brain require that individualized mapping of functional regions be performed before surgical interventions for cancer or epilepsy. The success of this mapping procedure has direct effects on surgical outcomes and preserving cognitive and sensory function post-surgery. Current gold standard procedures for pre-surgical mapping are invasive, time-consuming, and technically demanding. Several non-invasive procedures have emerged in recent years; however, they have not yet displaced the gold standard procedures. Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (t-fMRI), the most widely used non-invasive pre-surgical mapping technique, requires that patients perform cognitive or motor tasks while in the scanner—a time-consuming and expensive procedure. Also, not all patients can perform fMRI tasks due to language barriers, sensory deficits, being unconscious, etc. Connectome Fingerprinting (CF) is a recently developed technique that uses machine learning to train a model capable of predicting functional brain activation from task-free resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Once trained on a set of t-fMRI and rs- fMRI data, an unseen subject's unique pattern of brain activation can be predicted using only an rs-fMRI scan of their brain—therefore eliminating the need to perform tasks during the fMRI scan. Despite the promise of CF, the accuracy of the current best practice modeling techniques is not high enough yet to be clinically useful and studies applying CF have nearly always used healthy populations. Much research remains to be done to increase the accuracy of CF models before they can be deployed for pre-surgical mapping.  The long-term objective of the research proposed here is to develop a software application that combines applied machine learning with medical imaging to provide a non-invasive means for mapping the brains of neurosurgical patients before surgery. Importantly, we aim to increase the accuracy of CF modeling by expanding the modeling efforts to probabilistic Bayesian approaches that leverage prior information from the structure of the data. We will test a wide array of tunable data and model parameters to arrive at a current recommendation for best practices in CF research and applications. Finally, we will test our modeling procedures with a dataset of healthy control and pre-surgical patients diagnosed with brain tumors. We will test the software's ability to accurately predict functional brain organization in these patients and adaptively retrain the models to produce the most accurate results. This work has the potential to revolutionize pre-surgical brain mapping and expand its applicability to a greater number of patients. Project Narrative  In the United States, approximately 24,000 new cases of brain tumors are reported each year, with many patients requiring expensive pre-surgical planning and mapping of functional regions to minimize post-surgical impairments. In many neurosurgical practices [96% per 1], this involves performing a time-consuming and costly task-based fMRI acquisitions (nearly $1200/scan in 2014; [2]) before surgery to identify eloquent brain areas recruited for motor control, language, and cognition that must be spared during surgery. By combing task-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI and advanced machine learning to map the functional topology of the brain, the proposed technology will lower pre-surgical planning costs, reduce the burden on physicians and technicians, and expand pre-surgical mapping to previously excluded patients who cannot perform fMRI tasks.",Neurosurgical Planning with Robust Eloquent area Delineation from Individualized Connectivity-based Techniques (NeuroPREDICT),10139299,R43NS117226,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comb animal structure', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Sensory', 'Software Engineering', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'cognitive task', 'compliance behavior', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data quality', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'large scale data', 'motor control', 'multisensory', 'next generation', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'structured data', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'usability']",NINDS,"CHARLES RIVER ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,252569,0.03823803138416341
"Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax resulting in an inability of the thorax to support respiration or lung growth. TIS is associated with at least 28 pediatric syndromes, with an estimated health care cost per patient that can easily exceed a million dollars. In TIS, three-dimensional deformity of the thoracic components anatomically and functionally reduces the volume available for ventilation. Pediatric specialists dealing with TIS currently face several serious challenges: (a) The complex interplay among dynamic and growing thoracic structures and its influence on thoracic function and growth are not understood at present. (b) The prime outcome measure for the corrective procedures has remained the radiographic Cobb angle of the spine, a 60-year old metric with poor correlation with lung dynamic function and limited true health assessment value. (c) A normative imaging database with functional metrics describing dynamics and growth of the thoracic structures of the normal pediatric population does not exist. Due to these hurdles, innovations in growth-modulating surgical techniques are difficult to achieve. Supported by extensive preliminary results based on dynamic MRI (dMRI) of patients and normal subjects, the overarching goal of this proposal is to develop novel dynamic functional metrics for TIS by establishing a normative database of dMRI images and anatomic and functional models and metrics, and to translate these to develop markers of TIS and of its corrective-surgery outcomes. The project has three aims. Aim 1: To develop a new methodology called The Virtual Growing Child (VGC) consisting of 4 key components: a) To build a normative database of dMRI images prospectively gathered from 200 normal children divided into 10 groups. b) To build population anatomic models involving key thoraco-abdominal objects following an established automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) technology and deep learning (DL) techniques. c) To develop and validate joint AAR-DL algorithms to segment these objects in dMRI images of TIS patients. d) To build a normative database of measurements derived from dMRI images describing normal thoracic architecture, dynamic function, and growth. The database will also include a full battery of Pulmonary Function Testing data and anthropometric measurements. Aim 2: To test retrospectively the utility of the VGC ensemble in deriving markers of TIS and its surgical treatment effects on a cohort of 100 TIS patients. Aim 3: To retrospectively test the utility of the VGC approach for planning surgery in 30 TIS patients by comparing VGC-guided surgical planning to the current planning method. The post-operative key dMRI parameters of patients whose surgical plan would have changed due to VGC data will be compared to those of patients whose plan did not change. Expected outcomes: (i) A unique registry of thoracic dMRI of 200 normal pediatric subjects, segmented objects, and the associated anatomic, dynamic, and developmental parameters. (ii) A validated VGC approach for studying TIS which can also be utilized for studying other pediatric and adult thoracic disorders. Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax. Currently there are no reliable and scientific functional metrics to describe these disorders and their treatment effects. This grant application proposes to build an innovative methodology called the Virtual Growing Child (VGC) based on dynamic MRI of the thorax, construct a comprehensive normative database of MRI images and associated measurements, and utilize the VGC methodology to scientifically characterize TIS and arrive at innovative surgical planning methods.",Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies,9861454,R01HL150147,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Birth', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Lung', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rod', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Spirometry', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Diseases', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vertebral column', 'Vital capacity', 'age group', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'health assessment', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'surgery outcome', 'treatment effect', 'ventilation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,799509,0.04542591011716327
"Building a Platform for Precision Anesthesia for the Geriatric Surgical Patient PROJECT SUMMARY Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNCD) affect about 25% of patients in the period following surgery, and can persist for months or years in 10% of geriatric surgical patients. The presence of acute cognitive disturbances post-surgery increases the risk of patients eventually developing dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Poor cognitive outcomes lead to longer hospital stays, decreased quality of life, and increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, about half of elderly individuals require a surgical procedure at some time in their remaining years, and no interventions exist to prevent PNCD because the etiology is unclear. One of the main challenges in identifying the factors leading to chronic cognitive impairment is the lack of routine, comprehensive cognitive testing in the surgical care plan. This shortcoming is in part due to the lack of mobile, easy-to-use cognitive testing platforms. To establish the perioperative biomarkers contributing to cognitive decline, we will (1) integrate routine, comprehensive cognitive testing pre- and post-surgery, and (2) build a database and an analysis platform to mine this multidimensional dataset. Together, this aims to yield accurate models to pre-identify patients at risk and create targeted therapeutic interventions. We propose to build the foundational infrastructure for a precision medicine approach in geriatric surgical patients. In the R21 phase, we will build a novel comprehensive database of demographic and risk factor questionnaire responses, banked blood specimens, intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG), and inclusive cognitive testing. These data will be collected throughout the patient interaction, from the preoperative appointment through a year following the surgical procedure and available to other research teams. We will incorporate cognitive testing and collect large-scale data in the geriatric surgical setting, establishing a new precedent for subsequent multidisciplinary studies. This structure will afford us the opportunity to accurately track cognitive decline towards chronic conditions, such as dementia. In the R33 phase, we will develop an analysis platform capable of mining this multidimensional dataset. This phase will include EEG analysis and deep immune profiling using mass cytometry. Layered on these analyses we will build innovative machine learning tools to identify features and interactions contributing to both acute and chronic PNCD pathology. Our novel machine learning tools use prior knowledge to refine feature selection, thus addressing a common challenge faced by clinical research studies (having many measurements in a limited patient population), and will thus be of broad interest to other clinical research projects. PROJECT NARRATIVE Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNCD) affect about a quarter of geriatric surgical patients and increases the risk that those patients will go on to develop dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. However, no interventions exist to prevent PNCD, mostly because the etiology is unclear.

"Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY  Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) disorder is a condition in which the placenta fails to separate partially or totally from the uterine wall, resulting in significant intrapartum maternal morbidity and mortality at delivery. Depending on the extent of the placental invasion into surrounding tissue, hysterectomy may be lifesaving. Assessment of PAS severity prior to delivery is crucial for multidisciplinary surgical planning and patient counseling. However, there is an unmet clinical need for quantitative, objective measures of abnormal placentation that can serve as predictors of risk of invasion and hysterectomy. The overall goal of the proposed project is to prospectively assess PAS in high-risk women across gestation using quantitative multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and automated textural radiomics and to correlate findings with surgical outcomes.  Coming from a highly interdisciplinary background of MR chemistry, biology, and physics, the candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with in-depth knowledge and skills to conduct translational placental imaging research. The candidate's short-term goal is to complete a pilot study under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary advisory committee to evaluate PAS in women with high-risk pregnancies using multi-parametric MRI and textural radiomics.  To meet these goals, the following research aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate placental invasion across gestation using multi-parametric MR imaging and deep learning based novel quantification tools in PAS high- risk pregnancies, and 2) Extract the radiomic pattern across gestation of high-risk PAS placenta and determine its association with clinical surgical outcome. These research aims will serve as the platform for the career development plan and training aims which include: 1) Gain knowledge in translational prospective research design, 2) Improve technical skills in advanced clinical MR acquisition development, 3) Acquire applied statistical and data analysis skills, and 4) Develop mentorship and leadership skills while under training.  Together, the research and training aims will provide the training, experience and preliminary data for an R01 application. The future R01 will develop a clinical and surgical outcome prediction model for high-risk PAS pregnancies, potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes. The training will position the candidate to become a leader in translational placental imaging research. PROJECT NARRATIVE After a woman has had a cesarean delivery, if the placenta implants on the surgical scar in a subsequent pregnancy, there is a risk for invasion, referred to as placenta accreta spectrum (PAS); depending on its severity, a cesarean hysterectomy may be required with significant morbidity. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have shown promise in defining characteristics that alert the obstetrician to the severity of PAS. We will explore the vascularity and tissue characteristics of the placenta with MRI and identify quantitative predictive markers of disease severity and hope to better understand the pathophysiology of placenta accreta spectrum.",Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum,10105139,K25HD104004,"['Abnormal placentation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cellularity', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Chemistry', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Risk Woman', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perinatal', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Accreta', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Spin Labels', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fetal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'implantation', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrapartum', 'maternal morbidity', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NICHD,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K25,2020,114184,0.024956458661743196
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Outcome-Driven Approach to Minimize the Risks of Facial Distortion Following CMF Surgery Abstract:  Our main clinical motivation of this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with jaw (both maxilla and mandible) deformities by significantly improving surgical planning method. The number of patients suffering from jaw deformities is escalating each year.  Orthognathic surgery is a main surgical procedure to treat jaw deformities by repositioning bony segments of the jaws. The ultimate outcomes of orthognathic surgery are judged by the final facial appearance. Although the facial soft tissues are not directly operated on, the face changes “automatically” following the bony changes. Orthognathic surgery requires extensive surgical planning. While we can accurately plan the bony movements and transfer it to the patient during the surgery using computer-aided surgical simulation (CASS) and 3D printing, surgeons are still unable to practically predict the facial changes during the surgical planning, and just hope that a postoperative normal face will be “automatically” restored. However, this “mental-clue” approach is not reliable because the facial change does not exactly follow bony change. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, if a patient has a skeletal deformity and mild facial defect, a surgeon must know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But this information can only be attained by accurate method to predict facial changes. In addition, from patient’s perspective, the final facial appearance is great concern to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately predict facial changes.  In the previous project period, we have made significant achievements in predicting facial changes following bony movements using finite element (FE) method. However, this approach still requires a considerable amount of time to prepare FE models. In addition, rather than determining the ultimate surgical outcome (the postoperative facial appearance) first, the current method is still to predict the facial change passively following the bony surgery. These hurdles greatly prevent surgeons from practically using it in the clinical setting.  Our hypothesis is that a personalized precision treatment outcome can only be achieved if surgeons are able to determine the final treatment outcome, a desired postoperative face, before planning the bony surgery. To test our hypothesis, we propose to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together to first estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery.  The proposed project will have a significant clinical impact on improving patient care quality. It will enable clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single software in their routine clinical practice. It will also revolutionize the surgical planning technique using outcome- driven approach, i.e., to first estimate a desired postoperative face and then plan the bony surgery. Project Narrative: 1. In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring orthognathic surgery for jaw  deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissue, or both, is escalating every ear. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan orthognathic surgery by virtually repositioning bony  segments to desired locations, they are still unable to practically predict the ultimate treatment outcomes  of orthognathic surgery, a desired postoperative facial appearance, during the surgical planning. 3. We are proposing to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together to first  estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery, which will revolutionize the  surgical planning technique and enable clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial  and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single software in their routine clinical practice.",Outcome-Driven Approach to Minimize the Risks of Facial Distortion Following CMF Surgery,9895393,R01DE021863,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lip structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mandible', 'Maxilla', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Planning Techniques', 'Postoperative Period', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Skeleton', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'design', 'improved', 'learning network', 'orthognathic', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'risk minimization', 'skeletal', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'treatment planning', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,682604,0.01887663896331425
"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients.

"Multiscale models of fibrous interface mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY Interfaces between tissues either transfer load (requiring toughness) or provide a smooth surface (requiring low friction). Fibrous interfaces are very effective at transferring load between tissues, e.g., at connective tissue-bone interfaces (“entheses”), peritoneal-mesentery interfaces, interfaces between layers of the vasculature, and the pia mater. These interfaces require toughness to resist high stresses associated with material mismatches. Surgical repair can lead to smooth interfaces becoming fibrous, (e.g., following hernia surgery) or to tough interfaces becoming weak (e.g., following tendon- and ligament-to-bone repair). In older patients with large rotator cuff repairs, for example, where the desired attachment is not reformed, up to 94% of surgical repairs fail. These challenges arise in part because the features that endow fibrous interfaces with toughness are not known. We therefore propose to develop a comprehensive modeling and experimental approach for studying the factors underlying the transition from tough to weak in a fibrous interface. Our previous work motivates the hypothesis that disorder is a key toughening feature of fibrous attachments. We will focus initially on the example of tendon attaching to bone, in which microscale disorder underlies the ordered macroscale, graded transition between the two tissues, as a foundation for studying the general problem of adhesion throughout the body. We predict that disorder enhances energy absorption by distributing failure processes and energy absorption over larger volumes of tissue. We propose this as a fundamental mechanism by which fibrous interfaces in the body transfer load effectively. We will test these ideas through two aims: (1) Identify and model the mechanisms of fibrous attachment toughening ex vivo. We will model and experimentally validate how disorder across length scales toughens the tendon-to-bone attachment. Hierarchical molecular dynamics-to- continuum models, enriched by machine learning, will be validated in vitro, in systems with nanoscale control of mineral distributions, and ex vivo, in tissue samples of fibrous attachments. (2) Identify and model the loss of fibrous attachment toughness due to pathologic settings in vivo using murine rotator cuff tendinopathy models. In both aims, nano- through milli-scale characterization will be performed to define the mechanisms driving mechanical behavior. We will test the hypothesis that pathology- induced changes at multiple length scales will predict changes in failure mode. These models and experiments will test the global hypothesis that energy absorption across hierarchies is a fundamental toughening mechanism by which fibrous interfaces resist injury level loads. Taken together, we believe that these new models of fibrous attachment will enable an understanding of how the order and complexity of fibrous attachments leads to effective attachment of tissues. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tough fibrous interfaces between tissues are a common location of injury and source of pathology, pain and disability. Surgical repairs of interfaces that are desirable proceed in the absence of knowledge of the mechanisms that endow fibrous interfaces with toughness, and unsurprisingly have very high failure rates of up to a nearly unbelievable 94%. By developing and testing the first mathematical models for the toughness of this class of interfaces, we hope to identify the mechanisms of toughening definitively, and more broadly to provide technology that enables design of improved surgical procedures.",Multiscale models of fibrous interface mechanics,10037326,R01AR077793,"['Adhesions', 'Adhesives', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Botulinum Toxin Type A', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Diseases', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Connective Tissue', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Friction', 'Hernia', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Knowledge', 'Laparotomy', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Ligaments', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Mesentery', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Paralysed', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peritoneal', 'Physiological', 'Pia Mater', 'Process', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Running', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tendinopathy', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'absorption', 'bone', 'cranium', 'crosslink', 'design', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical behavior', 'millimeter', 'molecular dynamics', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nano', 'nanocrystal', 'nanoscale', 'older patient', 'repaired', 'treadmill']",NIAMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,545403,0.04947287232041973
"A Virtual Coach to Enhance Surgical Training using Human-Centric Modeling and Adaptive Haptic Guidance PROJECT SUMMARY We aim to reduce surgical robotic errors by developing novel technology to coach experienced practitioners by using real-time data-driven predictive models of operator behavior, task difﬁculty, and expertise levels during complex surgical training tasks. This technology could increase the effectiveness of simulation-based training, particularly for practicing clinicians, as the predictive models will inform the design of adaptive and personalized feedback for the surgeon.  Surgical training typically involves didactic learning, skills labs, and practice on live patients. Safety concerns asso- ciated with training on patients has led to signiﬁcant developments in simulation-based technology; however, existing simulators may lack the ability promote mastery of skills for practicing providers. Improved training is important for both the provider and the patient. An estimated 100,000 death per year occur due to preventable medical errors. In robotic surgeries, the majority of patient injuries can be attributed to inexperience and lack of technical competence of the attending surgeon. These errors could potentially be avoided through personalized and adaptive coaching.  In general, robotic systems can sense and adapt to their environment, even act autonomously to complete a task. However, the majority of surgical robots used today are “teleoperated systems"". These systems only perform tasks directly commanded by the human operator, possibly with some scaling or tremor cancellation. There is a missed opportunity to leverage the intelligence of robotic systems to sense and interpret the movements of the surgeon and to enable some form of adaptive feedback for personalized coaching. Our prior work in human-centric modeling could hold the key to the technical challenge of integrating intelligent methods into existing surgical robotic training platforms by better understanding the technical strengths and weaknesses of the practicing surgeon in a data-driven manner.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve surgical training outcomes by developing a personalized and adaptive surgical robotic coach capable of providing meaningful feedback to the practicing provider to optimize learning and skill transfer. The speciﬁc aims of the proposal include: (1) evaluate the ability of human- centric models to characterize surgeon performance using motion and video data, (2) design adaptive haptic or visual guidance cues to provide learners with real-time feedback and to optimize learning, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive technology coach through end-user validation using procedural-speciﬁc training models for general surgery, urology, and gynecologic oncology. This project could signiﬁcantly improve provider training in robotic surgery. The project could also improve provider training for laparoscopic and open surgery as the models used to develop the virtual coach are inherently human-centric and not tied to any speciﬁc surgical tasks or surgical platforms.  Our team is uniquely positioned to achieve success in this project, bringing together experts in surgical robotics, human-centric modeling, machine learning, and advanced surgical training. We have conducted extensive preliminary studies in areas related to this proposal, supporting feasibility of this project. Our integration with the Simulation Center at UTSW will enable translation of successful outcomes of this project into the surgical training and retraining pipeline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human-generated, preventable errors, particularly those made intra-operatively, can lead to morbidity and mortality for the patient and high costs for the hospital. While simple inanimate trainers have been successfully developed for surgical resident education, there is a lack of simulation-based technology for practicing surgeons. This research leverages novel data-driven methods to quantify how, and how well, a surgeon is performing a task for the long-term goal of developing personalized, adaptive virtual coaches for surgical robotic systems, resulting in better patient outcomes.",A Virtual Coach to Enhance Surgical Training using Human-Centric Modeling and Adaptive Haptic Guidance,10037429,R01EB030125,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Credentialing', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic Oncology', 'Gynecology', 'Hand', 'Hospital Costs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Rotation', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Error', 'Surgical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Transferable Skills', 'Translations', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Urinary Diversion', 'Urology', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'emotional factor', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptic feedback', 'haptics', 'human model', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'robotic system', 'robotic training', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'virtual coach', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2020,327275,0.14218861733253638
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance Project Summary Post-surgical complications (PSCs) have been an increasing concern for hospitals, particularly in light of payment reform focusing on longer episodes and Medicare penalties for 30-day readmissions and adverse outcomes including deep or organ space surgical site infections (DOS-SSIs). Readmission due to post- discharge complications in particular has become a target for quality improvement since many of these events are considered preventable. The wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to a number of clinical risk models for PSCs. These modeling efforts have primarily been targeted at the surgical specialty areas within which a large number of events occur (such as colorectal surgery) as well as applying sophisticated statistical modeling / machine learning to allow for missing data, interactions, and nonlinearities. However, there is still considerable room for improvement both in terms of accuracy and generalizability. In our current funding period, we have demonstrated the predictive value of clinical notes for PSCs. However, one glaring limitation of current models is that they are trained on high volume surgical specialties at large tertiary care institutions with high quality clinical data and use of advanced informatics approaches. The impetus of this proposal is essentially two-fold: (i) Accurate models can be created for lower volume institutions and specialties via transfer learning and leveraging more data via unconfirmed outcomes (i.e., those that mimic gold standard outcomes, but are less reliable) with proper accounting of reliability. (ii) Decision making can be significantly improved by leveraging time varying, real-time data such as labs, vitals, and clinical notes to provide the current risk of PSCs for patients using all information as it becomes available. We aim to i) develop and apply longitudinal risk models for PSCs to explicitly account for the time varying nature of some of the information (e.g., labs, vitals, clinical notes) as it becomes available in real-time so that it can be integrated into the clinician’s decision making; ii) develop and apply transfer learning to PSC risk models; iii) develop modeling approaches that allow for the use of more widely available unconfirmed outcomes, while explicitly accounting for the additional uncertainty and bias due to the use of such unconfirmed outcomes when compared to a less available gold standard; and iv) develop a widely applicable framework for model evaluation and monitoring. Models will often not perform in practice as they do in research for a variety of reasons. This framework will allow us to identify these issues and more efficiently translate and apply these complex predictive models into practice so that the research can have an immediate clinical impact. Successful development would open the door for next generation patient monitoring, alerts, and interventions for all surgical specialties and all institutions. We will make the relevant modeling results publicly available so that lower volume institutions can leverage the transfer learning approach developed here without the need for our actual data. This will ultimately lead to improved patient care and lower overall cost by identifying complications early and limiting readmission due to PSCs at Mayo Clinic and other institutions across the nation. Narrative Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EHRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EHRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EHRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,10001498,R01EB019403,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breast', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Surgery', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Glare', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Statistical Models', 'Surgical Specialties', 'Surgical Wound Infection', 'Surgical complication', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'data quality', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'health care quality', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'indexing', 'medical specialties', 'microbiome', 'next generation', 'novel', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid growth', 'risk prediction model', 'tertiary care', 'unstructured data']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,643686,0.08214092159362323
"Molecular guided surgery for enhanced resection of solid tumors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to facilitate the candidate's transition to a role as a leading academic researcher and multidisciplinary team member developing optical fluorescence-based technology, with the goal of improving extent of tumor resection (EOTR) in brain cancer. In particular, a focus of this proposal is on advancing fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) within the context of neurosurgical oncology. To this end, the proposal outlines a mentored-training program with a strong clinical emphasis to compliment the candidate's proficiency in medical and optical imaging, placing the candidate within a critical mass of NIH-funded researchers at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). The plan will focus on four complimentary areas: 1) providing a solid understanding of neurosurgical oncology, 2) developing an expertise in cancer molecular biology, 3) leading a pre-clinical investigation of molecular-guided cancer surgery, 4) expanding skills in optical engineering and machine learning, all of which will emphasize the synergy between understanding the clinical problems in neuro-oncology and advancing technology to address these problems. These goals are strongly supported by an experienced mentor team, led by neurosurgery section-chief Dr. Roberts, alongside NIH-funded researchers Profs. Paulsen, Pogue, and Hoopes. Leveraging the extensive opportunities at Dartmouth, the candidate will use K99 funding to devote time to graduate courses in cancer biology, medical imaging, and translational medicine, and to attend cancer workshops, training seminars, and CME-accredited Grand Rounds at the NCI Norris Cotton Cancer Center. The candidate will also attend AACR workshops to further strengthen clinical understanding of neuro-oncology, and provide a venue for presentation and feedback on the research work. The firm knowledge base gained by this training plan will be applied within the context of a pre-clinical research project to develop and evaluate a novel method of FGS- molecular-guided surgery (MGS) by means of intraoperative receptor concentration imaging (iRCI). The project will extend the rapidly growing field of FGS, applying a novel kinetic imaging approach to allow intraoperative evaluation of tumor-associated receptor expression, and to use this to guide surgical resection. Aim (1) will be to develop and test iRCI in a rat model of GBM, evaluating the accuracy of MGS to identify positive tissue and to improve EOTR compared with current FGS methods. Aim (2) will be to advance the current FGS camera systems, incorporating arterial input function measurement, and reducing absorption and scatter-based artifacts due to surface blood at the surgical site. Aim (3) will be to facilitate iRCI integrationinto the surgical workflow through strategic improvements in dye administration and AIF characterization. This proposal will expand the candidate's knowledge-base in cancer biology and surgical oncology, through extensive training opportunities and interactions with a strong multi-disciplinary team of mentors, equipping the candidate with all the necessary skills to accelerate the trajectory of his promising research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will provide the candidate an opportunity to broaden cancer biology and neurosurgical oncology skills through a comprehensive training program, to supplement already advanced skills in neuroimaging. Molecular guided surgery, an intraoperative technique designed to improve the extent of tumor resection by providing contrast between healthy and malignant tissue based on expression of tumor-specific receptors, will be developed and evaluated in a rat orthotopic model of human glioma.",Molecular guided surgery for enhanced resection of solid tumors,9915904,R00CA190890,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dyes', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Norris Cotton Cancer Center', 'Nude Rats', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Permeability', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Shoes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sodium Fluorescein', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Oncology', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'U251', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer surgery', 'career', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'human model', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'lens', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuroimaging', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'synergism', 'training opportunity', 'translational medicine', 'tumor']",NCI,DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK CLINIC,R00,2020,249000,0.03651615163081683
"A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to improve our ability to create and measure 3D models derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Our main motivation is to improve quality and reduce costs in care of patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities. The resulted innovations will also impact other fields. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffered from CMF deformities. The evaluation of these patients includes an assessment of CMF form on 3D models that are traditionally generated from segmented spiral multi-slice CTs (MSCTs). These models are also used to plan their treatment. The purpose of segmentation is to separate different anatomical structures and to remove the artifacts on the CTs. Once 3D models are generated from the segmented CTs, anatomical and teeth landmarks are manually digitized for measurements. Finally, diagnosis and treatment planning are performed based on measurements. Although MSCT provides high- quality images and thus allows relatively fast and easy post processing, many concerns have been raised on excessive radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, more doctors are now using CBCT scanners in their offices. CBCT has less radiation and is inexpensive compared to the MSCT, but their use in generating 3D models is greatly limited by the poor image quality, i.e., low contrast / signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts. Thus, the existing automated segmentation algorithms developed for MSCT are incapable of practically segmenting CBCTs. The current solution to CBCT segmentation entails an arduous and lengthy process that involves labor-intensive manual editing of hundreds of slices. Besides, another arduous and inaccurate task in the assessment of CMF deformities is the digitization of anatomical landmarks on 3D models - the first step to quantify the deformities. Currently a typical 3D cephalometric and teeth analysis requires the manual digitization of more than 200 landmarks, which is time consuming and has limited accuracy. We hypothesize that the creation and measurement of high-quality 3D models can be significantly improved by developing innovative CBCT-friendly post processing tools. Therefore, in this renewal project, we propose to develop and validate a novel CBCT analysis platform to automate the process of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization. The feasibility of our approaches has already been proven by our preliminary studies. Our innovative CBCT analysis platform will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals with CMF conditions. It will change our dental/CMF fields in effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for on-the-fly diagnosis and treatment planning. With minimal user intervention, the computer will accurately and effectively do the work, which is currently artistically done by the labor-intensive human operators. The resulted innovations may also impact other fields in the future, e.g., orthopedic surgery and cardiovascular surgery where intraoperative whole-body CBCT is acquired for image-guided surgery and intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in physician's offices for orthodontics, craniomaxillofacial (CMF) surgery, facial plastic surgery and dentistry, but its segmentation and landmark digitization have to be completed artistically by human operators, which is labor-intensive and with limited accuracy.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative CBCT post processing system to automate the processes of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization with minimal user intervention.  The proposed system will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals  with CMF conditions, and also change 1) the fields of orthodontics, CMF surgery and general dentistry in  effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for diagnosis and treatment planning, and 2) the fields of orthopedic  surgery, general surgery, and cardiovascular surgery where the quality and the speed of intraoperative imaging is critical.",A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities,9840832,R01DE022676,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Deformity', 'Dental Care', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Jaw', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Orthodontics', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'care costs', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'design', 'detector', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'segmentation algorithm', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,495143,0.05540509911029998
"Synchronized brain dynamics and eye movement trajectory for objective evaluation of robot-assisted surgical skills Complicated and costly robot assisted surgery (RAS) training results in less frequent use of this technology in several complex areas of surgery, and consequently ends up in harm. RAS requires a unique blend of skills in addition to manual competence with human-machine interaction skills, while operating remotely from patient with no tactile feedback. To address this challenge, numerous studies have focused on simulation-based robotic training curricula, like Fundamental Skills of Robotic Surgery (FSRS), to develop and assess the performance level of the surgeon operator. However, such training tools were developed based on metrics measured by performance on a simulator and other subjectively evaluated metrics. The goal of this research proposal is to develop a tool for objective RAS skill assessment and a model for performance monitoring. We hypothesize that brain dynamics - Electroencephalogram (EEG) - and eye movement behavior are able to detect change of skill level and the level of surgeon’s performance. To validate this hypothesis, we will record EEG signals and eye movement time series from subjects with different RAS expertise levels. Ten novices, 5 beginners, 5 advanced beginners, and 5 expert surgeons will be included in the study and continuously perform four levels of designed RAS training tasks on surgical robot simulator, dry lab, and animal lab during one year; (1) performing six basic tasks on surgical simulator. All subjects will practice these tasks during two weekly sessions and each practice session takes 2 hours. (2) Subjects will practice 3 tasks of peg transfer, pattern cutting, and suturing on dry lab. (3) Subjects will practice 2 tasks (anastomosis and dissection) on animal tissue and also on plastic models. (4) Subjects will practice two operations of nephrectomy and hysterectomy on animal lab, 2 operations in each session, and each session takes 3 hours and occurs every other week. Two master surgeons will subjectively evaluate performance of subjects (all 25 subjects; Score scale: 1-20) and expertise level (four categories) in performing the designed tasks, every practice session. Master surgeons evaluate surgeon’s skill and performance throughout task and notify change of skill level and performance through time. We will then develop a ‘deep convolutional neural network’ algorithm trained by EEG and eye movement time series through running windows with equal size, to classify subject skill level into four categories of a novice, beginner, advanced beginner, and expert. We will also use network neuroscience techniques to extract engineered features from EEG and eye movement data and use them for training a regression algorithm to develop a model for performance level prediction. Ultimately, the developed objective skill evaluation tool and performance monitoring model will make RAS training more efficient by providing feedback to the trainee regarding his/her skills and directing him/her to focus on skills needed improvement. These improvements will result in more frequent use of RAS in complex surgical areas and ultimately lead to patient safety. Project Narrative The use of robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has offered advantages for surgeons and patients, yet there is no clinically practical tool for objective evaluation of subject’s expertise level and performance. The overall objective of this research is to develop a tool for objective RAS skill assessment and a model for performance monitoring, leading to optimized RAS training process, improved patient safety and surgical outcomes.",Synchronized brain dynamics and eye movement trajectory for objective evaluation of robot-assisted surgical skills,9939074,R01EB029398,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Animals', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hysterectomy', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Nephrectomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wrist', 'adaptive learning', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'animal tissue', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'gaze', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'motor learning', 'neural network algorithm', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'regression algorithm', 'robot assistance', 'robotic device', 'robotic training', 'safety outcomes', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NIBIB,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2020,393075,0.05607448667633032
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"4D ventricle-valve model risk stratification for planning surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation Project Summary/Abstract Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a disease where the normal mitral valve (MV) structure is dysfunctional due to left ventricular (LV) remodeling after a myocardial infarction (MI). IMR affects nearly 3 million Americans and the magnitude of this problem is expected to grow as the population ages. IMR has a substantial mortality rate that is associated with even mild MR severity. Mitral valve repair with undersized ring annuloplasty has been the preferred treatment strategy for IMR; however, the recurrence of moderate or severe IMR within 12 months of surgery is common. Recent high profile results from the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) mul- ticenter randomized trials on IMR have confirmed a high incidence of early recurrent IMR. More importantly, these studies highlighted the adverse impact of recurrent IMR on LV remodeling and clinical outcomes. The CTSN trials demonstrated no significant difference in LV volume reduction or survival at 12 and 24 months between repair and replacement groups; however, subgroup analysis demonstrated that repair patients that developed recurrent IMR had no reduction in LV volume while repair patients without recurrence experienced LV volume reduction that was superior to patients having valve replacement. The results of the CTSN IMR trials indicate an unmet need for a pre-operative risk stratification tool that reliably predicts MV repair failure. Such a tool would significantly reduce the problem of recurrent IMR by performing valve repair only in patients likely to experience a durable result and performing valve replacement in patients with high risk of recurrence. The long term goal is to improve quality of surgical therapy in IMR by improving risk-stratification pre-operatively using image analysis tools. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve the prediction IMR recurrence by ex- panding this model to include the left ventricle (LV). The rationale is that while IMR manifests as MV malcoapta- tion, the root cause of the disease is LV remodeling. The central hypothesis is that features extracted from the integrated left ventricular and mitral valve (LVMV) model will predict recurrence more accurately than the current MV-only model. To fulfill this objective and test the central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Develop the 4D integrated LVMV model and compare the accuracy of fitting this model to intraoperative 3DTE images to that of the existing MV-only model. 2) Assess the ability of biomarkers derived from the integrated LVMV model to predict IMR recurrence, and compare to the predictive value of the MV-only model. The project is significant because, if successful, the integrated LVMV model will be incorporated into the Gorman lab ongoing effort translating this technology to the operating room, thus improving survival rates, reducing the impending clinical burden and the number of repeated procedures. Project Narrative The proposed project tackles the high impact problem of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) recurrence after surgical repair by developing a reliable real-time pre-operative risk stratification tool using image analysis of 3D transesophageal echocardiography. This will enable surgeons to optimize mitral surgical treatment in IMR on a case-by-case basis. If successful, the proposed research has the potential to virtually eliminate the problem of IMR recurrence, maximize long-term outcomes for millions of IMR patients and significantly decrease the im- pending clinical burden expected with an aging population.",4D ventricle-valve model risk stratification for planning surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation,9922382,F30HL142138,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Label', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Mitral Valve', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Transesophageal Echocardiography', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'aging population', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinically translatable', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'morphometry', 'mortality', 'muscular structure', 'papillary muscle', 'randomized trial', 'repaired', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'valve replacement', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2020,32585,0.05827719316653833
"Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas PROJECT SUMMARY Meningiomas, which arise from arachnoid cells, make up >1/3 of all intracranial tumors. While typically benign, these tumors induce clinical symptoms due to mass effect and peritumoral edema. In cases requiring intervention, gross total resection provides the best outcomes when possible. However, treatment strategy is ultimately decided by determining the proper balance between surgical difficulty and the patient's overall health. Two mechanical properties are important predictors of surgical difficulty: tumor stiffness and adherence to surrounding tissues. Knowledge of these properties before surgery would allow clinicians to more accurately assess surgical risk and identify the most effective treatment strategy. Mechanical properties are difficult to predict by conventional imaging approaches, but can be directly assessed by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and related Slip Interface Imaging (SII). In published studies, we have shown that MRE-based stiffness estimates are significantly correlated with tumor stiffness in meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Furthermore, SII accurately predicted tumor adherence in meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. Still, challenges remain to make these findings clinically-impactful. For estimating stiffness, the primary limitation lies in resolution. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will develop a voxel- wise classifier of tumor stiffness. This aim will build on our recently published neural network-based inversion (NNI), which has demonstrated superior performance to conventional direct inversions in simulation and in the brain. In Aim 1a, we will advance NNI by implementing more complex neural network architectures and creating more realistic simulations for training. In Aim 1b, the advances will be validated in a phantom with inhomogeneous stiffness. Finally, in Aim 1c with the aid of our Neurosurgery collaborators, we will collect a large sample of surgical stiffness assessments. We will use these assessments to train a voxel-wise stiffness classifier, which will then be validated in a separate test set. This aim will result in a map that conveys both stiffness and confidence in the prediction on a scale that is clinically meaningful to surgeons. The most-pressing limitations in SII include the subjective interpretation of the images and the lack of spatially resolved predictions. Aim 2 will address these challenges by developing a voxel-wise slip interface classifier. In Aim 2a, we will investigate a neural network-based predictor of slip interfaces to add to our current methods. In Aim 2b, we will evaluate if this new method can improve predictions in phantom experiments. In Aim 2c, we will again leverage surgical assessments of meningioma adherence to train and test a voxel-wise classifier. The result of this aim will be a map of tumor adherence represented as an easily interpreted probability. Taken together, these aims will provide neurosurgeons with clinically-important information to improve patient management. More broadly, technical advances made in this project will impact the entire MRE field. PROJECT NARRATIVE Meningiomas are the most common type of intracranial tumor and are best treated by total resection when possible. The mechanical properties of these tumors are important factors in surgical difficulty, where soft, non- adherent tumors are more easily removed that firm or adherent tumors. This project will use Magnetic Resonance Elastography and related Slip Interface Imaging to directly measure these properties, providing new clinically-important information to neurosurgeons and patients.",Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas,9897634,R01EB027064,"['Acoustic Neuroma', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Arachnoid mater', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Skull Base Neoplasms', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'mechanical properties', 'meningioma', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neurosurgery', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,357750,0.05249214795440077
"Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning Abstract: Our main clinical objective for this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities by significantly improving the surgical planning method. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffer from CMF deformities. The basic principles of CMF surgery involve the restoration of deformed CMF structures back to normal anatomy and functions with osteotomy, autologous, bone grafts, or vascularized free flaps. The success of CMF surgery depends on not only the technical aspects of the operation, but also, to a large extent, the precise formulation of a surgical plan. However, CMF surgical planning is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of CMF anatomy and deformity. During a routine CMF surgical planning, a surgeon first acquires a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull. He then performs 3D cephalometric analysis to quantify the deformity. Finally, the surgery is simulated by virtually cutting the 3D model into multiple bony segments. The surgeon then tries his best to move and rotate each segment individually to a desired position within the normal range of cephalometric values (the current standard of care). This is problematic as “normal” cephalometric values are the averageness of normal population, in which each value has a mean and a standard deviation. Due to the variation within the normal values, the surgeon must often guess what the exact value the patient's cephalometric measurement should be corrected to. In addition, cephalometry is a group of only linear and angular measurements, which certainly cannot represent the complex nature of human CMF structures. Therefore, surgical outcomes are often subjective and heavily dependent on the surgeons' experience and artistic talent. Because each human face is different, the average “normal values” cannot represent the complex morphology of each individual face. To this end, we hypothesize that if a surgeon can foresee what the normal CMF shape of the patient should be, the surgical plan will be objective and personalized. Therefore, in this project, we propose developing and validating a new surgical planning method of using patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models. The feasibility of our approach has already been proven by our preliminary studies. The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively. The results will be especially beneficial to patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic craniofacial deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer. In the future, our approach can also be used to design and print 3D patient-specific resorbable bone implants with tissue engineering capability for bone regeneration. Project Narrative:  The current standard of care of making treatment plan for patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF)  deformities is cephalometric analysis, including a group of linear and angular measurements, which  cannot represent the complex morphology of human CMF facial structures.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative shape-based surgical planning method of using  patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models, for replacing the current subjective  cephalometric method.  The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing  personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively, which is especially beneficial  to the patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer.",Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning,9950849,R01DE027251,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Autologous', 'Back', 'Bilateral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Head', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'operation', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'psychologic', 'restoration', 'skull base', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality simulator', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,574725,0.15108716131717215
"Predicting the Need for Surgery in Pediatric Subglottic Stenosis using Airway Elastography Derived from Endoscopic OCT and Intraluminal Pressure Measurement Project Abstract  Subglottic stenosis (SGS) is one of the most common life-threatening airway disorders in infants and children. Current treatment methods are based on airway endoscopy, which provides only qualitative information. Surgical treatment failures for the most severe grades of SGS range toward 50%, often due to post-operative airway collapse in new, unpredicted locations. Treatment planning could be improved if evidence-based, quantitative, physiologic or anatomic metrics were available.  To address this need, we propose to advance anatomic optical coherence tomography (aOCT) for high- resolution, high-speed imaging of the airway. Endoscopic aOCT and intraluminal pressure catheters will be used simultaneously to inform models of airway wall viscoelasticity (VE). In combination with simulated surgery and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this constitutes a powerful new clinical tool to predict airway collapse and airflow resistance in children with SGS. Our ultimate goal is to develop an aOCT-informed pipeline to model tissue VE, perform simulated surgery, predict outcomes from a variety of surgical plans and, ultimately, reduce treatment failures. This will leverage existing infrastructure at UNC, including the Virtual Pediatric Airways Workbench for simulated surgery, the Pediatric Airway Atlas of normal airways, and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling of the dynamic interplay between airway wall VE, airway deformation, and intraluminal pressure to accurately model and predict airway collapse.  Our first Aim is to verify that geometric and pressure-related metrics that correlate with whether children receive surgery for SGS, previously established using CT, can be obtained from endoscopic aOCT, thereby avoiding ionizing radiation exposure. Our second Aim is technical development of dynamic (4 dimensional, 4D) aOCT imaging to quantify airway wall VE, validated against CINE CT in pigs. Our final Aim is to create 4D models of the airway in children with SGS including VE properties using aOCT, perform simulated surgery to predict patient-specific post-surgical outcomes, and compare these to post-surgical aOCT models created from routine post-operative surveillance endoscopies. In addition to the development of a new tool, these experiments will also provide new data on longitudinal changes in VE wall properties before and after surgery. Achievement of these goals will provide improved metrics for decision-making and enable evaluation of the dynamic airway without radiation exposure. Our long-term goals are to: 1) validate this approach clinically at multiple institutions; 2) evaluate the ability of these methods to improve outcomes; and 3) use the tool to study other airway diseases, such as obstructive sleep apnea (~10% of the population), in children and adults. Public Health Relevance  Our immediate goal is to develop a tool for quantitative, high-speed endoscopy via anatomic optical coherence tomography (aOCT) that eliminates radiation exposure for evaluation of infants and children with subglottic stenosis, a life-threatening upper airway disorder. The tool will be developed as part of an individualized pipeline to model each subject’s airway, simulate surgery, and predict surgical outcomes to better inform surgical decision-making. Our long-term goals are to validate this approach clinically at multiple institutions, to evaluate the ability of these methods to improve outcomes, and to extend our methods to study other common airway diseases in children and adults.",Predicting the Need for Surgery in Pediatric Subglottic Stenosis using Airway Elastography Derived from Endoscopic OCT and Intraluminal Pressure Measurement,10065215,R01HL154429,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cine CT', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endoscopy', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Foundations', 'Four-dimensional', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory Insufficiency', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Surgical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vision', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'elastography', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'virtual', 'viscoelasticity']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,826422,0.06970268837772005
"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9914111,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical center', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'large datasets', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable sensor technology']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,7231781,0.06284713247067134
"Microendoscopic Electrical Impedance Sensing for Real-time Intraoperative Surgical Margin Assessment ABSTRACT The primary objective of surgical therapy for the treatment of patients with cancer is to remove all cancer cells from within the body, with the secondary objective of maintaining organ function. The primary pathological metric used to rate the success of a surgical procedure is evaluation of the surgical margin of the resected tissue specimen, post-operatively. This typically involves cutting the tissue into sections and microscopically exploring these tissue samples for the presence of cancer cells at the margins. Cancer cells noted at the margins represent Positive Surgical Margins (PSMs) and suggest that cancer cells were left in the body following the procedure. As a result, patients with PSMs are often exposed to noxious additional procedures to eradicate the cancer cells left behind including radiation, chemical, hormonal, and additional surgical therapy; these all have adverse morbidities that decrease a patient's quality of life. No clinical protocols are routinely used to intraoperatively assess surgical margin status during surgical procedures. Instead, margins are evaluated through microscopic assessment of the tissue following the procedure, when it is too late to provide additional surgical intervention. We aim to develop an intraoperative device able to assess surgical margin status so that the surgeons can extract additional tissues in real-time and ultimately decrease the rates of PSMs. While our technology can be applied for most cancer surgeries, we are focusing our efforts on prostate cancer as these are the highest incidence and cause of death for men and because patients with PSMs following these procedures have a much higher rate of recurrence than patients that have negative surgical margins. We have previously shown that the electrical impedance (a property that describes how easily electrical current passes through a tissue) of tissue is sensitive to a tissue's cellular arrangement and can be used to distinguish cancer from benign tissue in prostate. We have developed a prototype flexible endoscopic device capable of imaging the electrical impedance tissue during radical prostatectomy procedures using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) techniques. This device makes focal measurements of margin status. Here we aim to take the significant step of constructing an optimized EIT device that can be deployed laparoscopically (e.g. prostate surgery) to provide an accurate method of intraoperatively identifying positive surgical margins. We aim to develop this device, develop intraoperative visualization strategies to help guide surgeons, evaluate the technology in an in vivo study, and validate the technology intraoperatively. By the end of this program we intend to have developed a low-cost, single use probe that can be deployed in a multi- center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of this technology for intraoperative surgical margin assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gauging electrical properties of surgical margins during tumor resection procedures has the potential to alert surgeons to regions of cancer not fully extracted and subsequently reduce the number of positive surgical margins which are significantly correlated with cancer recurrence. The intraoperative electrical property sensing/imaging probe and the visualization tools proposed here will provide an accurate, rapid, and cost- effective method for gauging these surgical margins for multiple cancer types. We will explore this technology in the context of prostate cancer surgery with the expectation that this will further advance the study of electrical property signatures of normal and diseased tissue in vivo and help to translate this technology to the clinic.",Microendoscopic Electrical Impedance Sensing for Real-time Intraoperative Surgical Margin Assessment,10052504,R01CA237654,"['Adjuvant Therapy', 'Asses', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bladder Control', 'Breast', 'Cancerous', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Erectile dysfunction', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Histopathology', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Incontinence', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nephrectomy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pelvic floor structure', 'Periprostatic', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resected', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Urethra', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer surgery', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'expectation', 'feasibility trial', 'flexibility', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'man', 'men', 'mortality', 'neurovascular', 'programs', 'prostate surgery', 'prototype', 'safety and feasibility', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'urinary bladder neck']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,470823,0.06404616482942016
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,9869041,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity -

"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,9994414,R01NS110347,"['Ablation', 'Anterior Temporal Lobectomy', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Common Data Element', 'Contralateral', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Freedom', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Publishing', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'millimeter', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,646134,0.12581278037340896
"Real-time Multimodal Diffuse Reflectance and Polarization Imaging Based Nerve Identification in Surgical Field of View PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to develop a novel non-contact, label-free multimodality imager that provides real-time intraoperative identification of nerves within the surgical field-of-view to facilitate the prevention of unintended nerve damage (termed iatrogenic nerve injury) during surgical procedures, as they are a major source of postsurgical complications, e.g., chronic pain. In the United States chronic pain management is a major putative contributing factor in the current opioid-related drug overdose epidemic. Annually, over 45 million surgical procedures are performed in the United States and an estimated 10% to 50% of them result in patient chronic postoperative pain outcomes. Though not all the at least 4.5 million are definitively ascribable to iatrogenic nerve injury, it nonetheless represents a significant recurring annual healthcare problem. Relatedly, analysis of large-scale nerve lesion treatment studies reveals that 25%, 60% and 94% respectively of sciatic, femoral and accessory nerve lesions addressed are caused by iatrogenic nerve injury. Additionally, iatrogenic nerve injury features prominently in post-surgical quality of life issues that range from loss of sensation and motor function, to the aforementioned chronic pain, and morbidity. Reportedly, 2-3 years post radical prostatectomy ~60% of men are still impotent as a result of damaged cavernous nerves. Likewise, 20% - 60% of mastectomy breast cancer treatment survivors suffer chronic post-surgical pain that significantly reduces their quality of life, and injury to the intercostobrachial nerve is the primary cause. Even in surgeries with minimal neural damage risk like acoustic neuroma removal (<1%), spinal scoliosis surgery (<0.6%), and thyroidectomy (<2-3.8%) the consequences of nerve damage can be severe: leading to deafness, paraplegia, and even death respectively. The associated financial implications of iatrogenic nerve damage are significant. There are direct financial costs to the individual due to loss of employment and/or income, and to the healthcare industry as nerve damage is a common source of litigation with compensation being awarded in 82% of cases of spinal accessory nerve injury, for an example. The exposure of healthcare personnel and providers to medicolegal liability is extensive as Iatrogenic nerve injuries are commonly reported on the laryngeal nerve during thyroid operations, trigeminal nerve and inferior alveolar nerve during facial and oral surgeries, intercostal nerves during thoracic surgeries, and on the spinal accessory nerves, common peroneal nerve, superficial radial nerve, and genitofemoral nerve branches during various other surgeries. Consequently, as of 2015, medicolegal litigation risk was a primary driver for a $2.2 billion global market for intraoperative nerve monitoring projected to grow annually at 4.79% until 2025. Our proposed solution targets filling both the deficiencies of currently available options and the growing demand by introducing an effective, commercially viable product. PROJECT NARRATIVE Unintended nerve damage during surgical procedures is a significant and costly public healthcare delivery problem and current methods for injury prevention via intraoperative nerve monitoring leave substantial room for improvement. The ramifications of increased healthcare costs due to associated medical-liability issues and the significant reductions in quality of life issues, including the burgeoning chronic pain management related opioid-related drug overdose epidemic, make addressing this very impactful to society. The proposed development will yield an effective, commercially viable, non-contact multimodality imager that provides real- time intraoperative identification of nerves within the surgical field-of-view to facilitate the prevention of unintended nerve damage during surgical procedures.",Real-time Multimodal Diffuse Reflectance and Polarization Imaging Based Nerve Identification in Surgical Field of View,10158278,R41EB029888,"['Acoustic Neuroma', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Biophotonics', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Employment', 'Epidemic', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Financial compensation', 'Financial cost', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hybrids', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Impotence', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intellectual Property', 'Label', 'Laryngeal Nerves', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Litigation', 'Mastectomy', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Liabilities', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Numbness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Oral Surgical Procedures', 'Overdose', 'Paraplegia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Structure', 'Structure of radial nerve', 'Surgeon', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Surgical Procedures', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroidectomy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trigeminal nerve structure', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ventral thoracic nerve structure', 'absorption', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain management', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'data visualization', 'deafness', 'design', 'diffuse reflectance spectroscopy', 'health care delivery', 'imager', 'in vivo', 'inferior alveolar nerve', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'multimodality', 'nerve injury', 'novel', 'operation', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'pain outcome', 'peroneal nerve', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'sciatic nerve', 'scoliosis', 'spectroscopic imaging']",NIBIB,"YAYA SCIENTIFIC, LLC",R41,2020,333355,-0.04634527315164832
